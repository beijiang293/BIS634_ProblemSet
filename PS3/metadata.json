        "ArticleTitle": "Curcumin Reduces Amyloid Beta Oligomer Interactions with Anionic Membranes.",
        "AbstractText": "Many neurodegenerative diseases involve amyloidogenic proteins forming surface-bound aggregates on anionic membranes, and the peptide amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) in Alzheimer's disease is one prominent example of this. Curcumin is a small polyphenolic molecule that provides an interesting opportunity to understand the fundamental mechanisms of membrane-mediated aggregation because it embeds into membranes to alter their structure while also altering A\u03b2 aggregation in an aqueous environment. The purpose of this work was to understand interactions among curcumin, \u03b2-sheet-rich A\u03b2 fibrillar oligomers (FO), and a model anionic membrane. From a combination of liquid surface X-ray scattering experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we found that curcumin embedded into an anionic 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylglycerol (DMPG) membrane to rest between the lipid headgroups and the tails, causing disorder and membrane thinning. FO accumulation on the membrane was reduced by \u223c66% in the presence of curcumin, likely influenced by membrane thinning. Simulation results suggested curcumin clusters near exposed phenylalanine residues on a membrane-embedded FO structure. Altogether, curcumin inhibited FO interactions with a DMPG membrane, likely through a combination of altered membrane structure and interactions with the FO surface. This work elucidates the mechanism of curcumin as a small molecule that inhibits amyloidogenesis through a combination of both membrane and protein interactions.",

        "AbstractText": "Higher coffee consumption has been associated with reduced dementia risk, yet with inconsistencies across studies. CYP1A2 polymorphisms, which affects caffeine metabolism, may modulate the association between coffee and the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We included 5964 participants of the Three-City Study (mean age 74 years-old), free of dementia at baseline when they reported their daily coffee consumption, with available genome-wide genotyping and followed for dementia over a median of 9.0 (range 0.8-18.7) years. In Cox proportional-hazards models, the relationship between coffee consumption and dementia risk was modified by CYP1A2 polymorphism at rs762551 (p for interaction\u2009=\u20090.034). In multivariable-adjusted models, coffee intake was linearly associated with a decreased risk of dementia among carriers of the C allele only (\"slower caffeine metabolizers\"; HR for 1-cup increased [95% CI]\u20090.90 [0.83-0.97]), while in non-carriers (\"faster caffeine metabolizers\"), there was no significant association but a J-shaped trend toward a decrease in dementia risk up to 3 cups/day and increased risk beyond.

Results were similar when studying AD and another CYP1A2 candidate polymorphism (rs2472304), but no interaction was found with CYP1A2 rs2472297 or rs2470893. In this cohort, a linear association of coffee intake to lower dementia risk was apparent only among carriers of CYP1A2 polymorphisms predisposing to slower caffeine metabolism.",

However, standard validated methods and software tools are lacking. Here, we assessed the performance of a framework for the harmonization of brain PET scans in a multi-center European clinical trial. Hoffman 3D brain phantoms were acquired in 28 PET systems and reconstructed using site-specific settings. Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the Effective Image Resolution (EIR) and harmonization kernels were estimated for each scan. The target EIR was selected as the coarsest EIR in the imaging network. Using \"Hoffman 3D brain Analysis tool,\" indicators of image quality were calculated before and after the harmonization: The Coefficient of Variance (COV%), Gray Matter Recovery Coefficient (GMRC), Contrast, Cold-Spot RC, and left-to-right GMRC ratio. A COV%\u2009\u2264\u200915% and Contrast\u2009\u2265\u20092.2 were set as acceptance criteria. The procedure was repeated to achieve a 6-mm target EIR in a subset of scans. The method's robustness against typical dose-calibrator-based errors was assessed. The EIR across systems ranged from 3.3 to 8.1\u00a0mm, and an EIR of 8\u00a0mm was selected as the target resolution. After harmonization, all scans met acceptable image quality criteria, while only 13 (39.4%) did before. The harmonization procedure resulted in lower inter-system variability indicators: Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD COV% (from 16.97\u2009\u00b1\u20096.03 to 7.86\u2009\u00b1\u20091.47%), GMRC Inter-Quartile Range (0.040-0.012), and Contrast SD (0.14-0.05). Similar results were obtained with a 6-mm FWHM target EIR. Errors of\u2009\u00b1\u200910% in the DRO activity resulted in differences below 1\u00a0mm in the estimated EIR. Harmonizing the EIR of brain PET scans significantly reduced image quality variability while minimally affecting quantitative accuracy. This method can be used prospectively for harmonizing scans to target sharper resolutions and is robust against dose-calibrator errors. Comparable image quality is attainable in brain PET multi-center studies while maintaining quantitative accuracy.",

Physiologically, these two proteins are produced and expressed within the normal human body. However, under pathological conditions, abnormal expression, post-translational modifications, conformational changes, and truncation can make these proteins prone to aggregation, triggering specific disease-related cascades. Recent studies have indicated associations between aberrant behavior of amyloid-beta and tau proteins and various neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as retinal neurodegenerative diseases like Glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. Additionally, these proteins have been linked to cardiovascular disease, cancer, traumatic brain injury, and diabetes, which are all leading causes of morbidity and mortality.

        "AbstractText": "The study of modified RNA known as epitranscriptomics has become increasingly relevant in our understanding of disease-modifying mechanisms. Methylation of N6 adenosine (m6A) and C5 cytosine (m5C) bases occur on mRNAs, tRNA, mt-tRNA, and rRNA species as well as non-coding RNAs. With emerging knowledge of RNA binding proteins that act as writer, reader, and eraser effector proteins, comes a new understanding of physiological processes controlled by these systems. Such processes when spatiotemporally disrupted within cellular nanodomains in highly specialized tissues such as the brain, give rise to different forms of disease. In this review, we discuss accumulating evidence that changes in the m6A and m5C methylation systems contribute to neurocognitive disorders. Early studies first identified mutations within FMR1 to cause intellectual disability Fragile X syndromes several years before FMR1 was identified as an m6A RNA reader protein. Subsequently, familial mutations within the m6A writer gene METTL5, m5C writer genes NSUN2, NSUN3, NSUN5, and NSUN6, as well as THOC2 and THOC6 that form a protein complex with the m5C reader protein ALYREF, were recognized to cause intellectual development disorders. Similarly, differences in expression of the m5C writer and reader effector proteins, NSUN6, NSUN7, and ALYREF in brain tissue are indicated in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, individuals with a high neuropathological load or have suffered traumatic brain injury. Likewise, an abundance of m6A reader and anti-reader proteins are reported to change across brain regions in Lewy bodies diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and individuals with high cognitive reserve. m6A-modified RNAs are also reported significantly more abundant in dementia with Lewy bodies brain tissue but significantly reduced in Parkinson's disease tissue, whilst modified RNAs are misplaced within diseased cells, particularly where synapses are located. In parahippocampal brain tissue, m6A modification is enriched in transcripts associated with psychiatric disorders including conditions with clear cognitive deficits. These findings indicate a diverse set of molecular mechanisms are influenced by RNA methylation systems that can cause neuronal and synaptic dysfunction underlying neurocognitive disorders. Targeting these RNA modification systems brings new prospects for neural regenerative therapies.",

Although at first it was considered innocuous, small vessel disease is nowadays regarded as one of the major vascular causes of dementia.

The pathophysiology of these lesions has been linked to multiple processes, such as hypoperfusion, defective cerebrovascular reactivity, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Notably, studies on small vessel disease suggest that blood-brain barrier dysfunction is among the earliest mechanisms in small vessel disease and might contribute to the development of the hallmarks of small vessel disease. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to provide a new foundation in the study of small vessel disease pathology.

Tau physiologically promotes the assembly and stabilization of microtubules, whereas specific truncated fragments are sufficient to induce abnormal hyperphosphorylation and aggregate into toxic oligomers, resulting in them gaining prion-like characteristics. In addition, Tau truncations cause extensive impairments to neural and glial cell functions and animal cognition and behavior in a fragment-dependent manner.

To combat neuroinflammation, the inhibition of the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) enzyme has been demonstrated crucial. Importantly, sEH inhibition could be related to other neuroprotective pathways described in AD. The aim of the study was to unveil new molecular pathways driving neuroprotection through sEH, we used an optimized, potent, and selective sEH inhibitor (sEHi, UB-SCG-51). UB-SCG-51 was tested in neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, in primary mouse and human astrocytes cultures challenged with proinflammatory insults and in microglia cultures treated with amyloid oligomers, as well as in mice AD model (5XFAD). UB-SCG-51 (10 and 30\u2009\u03bcM) prevented neurotoxic reactive-astrocyte conversion in primary mouse astrocytes challenged with TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, and C1q (T/I/C) combination for 24\u2009h. Moreover, in microglial cultures, sEHi reduced inflammation and glial activity. In addition, UB-SCG-51 rescued 5XFAD cognitive impairment, reducing the number of Amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and Tau hyperphosphorylation accompanied by a reduction in neuroinflammation and apoptotic markers. Notably, a transcriptional profile analysis revealed a new pathway modulated by sEHi treatment. Specifically, the eIF2\u03b1/CHOP pathway, which promoted the endoplasmic reticulum response, was increased in the 5XFAD-treated group. These findings were confirmed in human primary astrocytes by combining sEHi and eIF2\u03b1 inhibitor (eIF2\u03b1i) treatment. Besides, combining both treatments resulted in increased in C3 gene expression after T/I/C compared with the group treated with sEHi alone in cultures. Therefore, sEHi rescued cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration in AD mice model, based on the reduction of inflammation and eIF2\u03b1/CHOP signaling pathway. In whole, our results support the concept that targeting neuroinflammation through sEH inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy to fight against Alzheimer's disease with additive and/or synergistic activities targeting neuroinflammation and cell stress.",

We used UK Biobank (UKBB) data to investigate the relation of mitochondrial SNP rs2853499, with AD. To identify cases of AD we used ICD10 code G30.9. Data processing was performed on Minerva, a Linux mainframe with Centos 7.6, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. We used PLINK, a whole-genome association analysis toolset, to analyze the UKB22418 mitochondrial hard-called chromosome file. Of 953 AD cases, 493 were male (51.7%) and 460 were female (48.3%). Mothers were twice as likely to transmit AD compared to fathers. We found that in individuals with AD, 22.3% (n=201) carried the A allele of SNP rs2853499, 77.7% (n=700) carried the G allele. In individuals without AD, 22.2% (n=10,7726) carried the A allele of SNP rs2853499, 77.8% (n=378,535) carried the G allele. This difference was not significant (p=0.91, two-tailed Fisher exact test).

        "AbstractText": "Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is recognized as a preclinical indicator\u00a0of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and this stage provides a valuable time window for ultra-early intervention in AD. The aim of this study was to investigate the neurocognitive characteristics of SCD and its correlation with objective cognition, negative emotion and sleep quality in Chinese elderly. A total of 1200 volunteers aged 60 and older underwent Brief Elderly Cognitive Screening Inventory, Quick Cognitive Screening Scale for the Elderly, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Core Neuropsychological Test. According to the examination results, the participants were divided into healthy control (HC) and SCD groups. The neurocognitive function of SCD and its relationship with objective cognition, negative emotion and sleep quality were analyzed.

NODDI measures in medial temporal tracts were more strongly correlated to cognitive performance and pathology than standard measures. The combination of NODDI and standard metrics exhibited the strongest prediction of cognitive performance in random forest analyses.

        "AbstractText": "Neuroinflammation, impaired metabolism, and hypoperfusion are fundamental pathological hallmarks of early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Numerous studies have asserted a close association between neuroinflammation and disrupted cerebral energetics. During AD progression and other neurodegenerative disorders, a persistent state of chronic neuroinflammation reportedly exacerbates cytotoxicity and potentiates neuronal death. Here, we assessed the impact of a neuroinflammatory challenge on metabolic demand and microvascular hemodynamics in the somatosensory cortex of an AD mouse model. We utilized in vivo 2-photon microscopy and the phosphorescent oxygen sensor Oxyphor 2P to measure partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) and capillary red blood cell flux in cortical microvessels of awake mice. Intravascular pO2 and capillary RBC flux measurements were performed in 8-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice and wildtype littermates on days 0, 7, and 14 of a 14-day period of lipopolysaccaride-induced neuroinflammation. Before the induced inflammatory challenge, AD mice demonstrated reduced metabolic demand but similar capillary red blood cell flux as their wild type counterparts. Neuroinflammation provoked significant reductions in cerebral intravascular oxygen levels and elevated oxygen extraction in both animal groups, without significantly altering red blood cell flux in capillaries. This study provides evidence that neuroinflammation alters cerebral oxygen demand at the early stages of AD without substantially altering vascular oxygen supply. The results will guide our understanding of neuroinflammation's influence on neuroimaging biomarkers for early AD diagnosis.",

        "AbstractText": "The PINK1-PRKN pathway mediates a critical quality control to maintain mitochondrial health and function. Together the kinase-ligase pair identifies and decorate damaged mitochondria with phosphorylated ubiquitin (p-S65-Ub). This selective label serves as the mitophagy tag and facilitates their degradation via autophagy-lysosome system. While complete loss of PINK1 or PRKN function causes early-onset Parkinson disease, much broader mitophagy impairments are emerging across neurodegenerative disorders. We previously found age- and disease-dependent accumulation of p-S65-Ub signal in the hippocampus of autopsy brains with Lewy body disease (LBD). However, the contribution of genetic variation to mitochondrial damage and p-S65-Ub levels remains unknown in LBD cases. To identify novel regulators of PINK1-PRKN mitophagy in LBD, we performed an unbiased genome-wide association study of hippocampal p-S65-Ub level with 1,012 autopsy confirmed LBD samples. Using an established, mostly automated workflow, hippocampal sections were immunostained for p-S65-Ub, scanned, and quantified with unbiased algorithms. Functional validation of the significant hit was performed in animal model and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). We identified a strong association with p-S65-Ub for APOE4 (rs429358; \u03b2 : 0.50, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.69; p =8.67x10 -25 ) and a genome-wide significant association for ZMIZ1 (rs6480922; \u03b2 : -0.33, 95% CI: -0.45 to -0.22; p =1.42x10 -8 ). The increased p-S65-Ub levels in APOE4 -carrier may be mediated by both co-pathology-dependent and -independent mechanisms, which was confirmed in Apoe-targeted replacement mice and hiPSC-derived astrocytes. Intriguingly, ZMIZ1 rs6480922 also significantly associated with increased brain weight and reduced neuropathological burden indicating a potential role as a resilience factor. Our findings nominate novel mitophagy regulators in LBD brain ( ZMIZ1 locus) and highlight a strong association of APOE4 with mitophagy alteration. With APOE4 being the strongest known risk factor for clinical Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, our findings suggest a common mechanistic link underscoring the importance of mitochondrial quality control.",

        "AbstractText": "The development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex process that can change over time, during which genetic influences on phenotypes may also fluctuate. Incorporating longitudinal phenotypes in genome wide association studies (GWAS) could help unmask genetic loci with time-varying effects. In this study, we incorporated a varying coefficient test in a longitudinal GWAS model to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may have time- or age-dependent effects in AD. Genotype data from 1,877 participants in the Alzheimer's Neuroimaging Data Initiative (ADNI) were imputed using the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) panel, resulting in 9,573,130 SNPs. Subjects' longitudinal impairment status at each visit was considered as a binary and clinical phenotype. Participants' composite standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) derived from each longitudinal amyloid PET scan was considered as a continuous and biological phenotype. The retrospective varying coefficient mixed model association test (RVMMAT) was used in longitudinal GWAS to detect time-varying genetic effects on the impairment status and SUVR measures. Post-hoc analyses were performed on genome-wide significant SNPs, including 1) pathway analyses; 2) age-stratified genotypic comparisons and regression analyses; and 3) replication analyses using data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). Our model identified 244 genome-wide significant SNPs that revealed time-varying genetic effects on the clinical impairment status in AD; among which, 12 SNPs on chromosome 19 were successfully replicated using data from NACC. Post-hoc age-stratified analyses indicated that for most of these 244 SNPs, the maximum genotypic effect on impairment status occurred between 70 to 80 years old, and then declined with age. Our model further identified 73 genome-wide significant SNPs associated with the temporal variation of amyloid accumulation. For these SNPs, an increasing genotypic effect on PET-SUVR was observed as participants' age increased. Functional pathway analyses on significant SNPs for both phenotypes highlighted the involvement and disruption of immune responses- and neuroinflammation-related pathways in AD. We demonstrate that longitudinal GWAS models with time-varying coefficients can boost the statistical power in AD-GWAS. In addition, our analyses uncovered potential time-varying genetic variants on repeated measurements of clinical and biological phenotypes in AD.",

These phenotypes correlate with and are linked to elevated neuronal intracellular calcium ( i Ca 2+ ) levels. Recently, our group reported that mitochondrial calcium ( m Ca 2+ ) overload, due to loss of m Ca 2+ efflux capacity, contributes to AD development and progression. We also noted proteomic remodeling of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter channel (mtCU) in sporadic AD brain samples, suggestive of altered m Ca 2+ uptake in AD. Since the mtCU is the primary mechanism for Ca 2+ uptake into the mitochondrial matrix, inhibition of the mtCU has the potential to reduce or prevent m Ca 2+ overload in AD. Here, we report that neuronal-specific loss of mtCU-dependent m Ca 2+ uptake in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD reduced A\u03b2 and tau-pathology, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive decline. Knockdown of Mcu in a cellular model of AD significantly decreased matrix Ca 2+ content, oxidative stress, and cell death.

They include non-ribosomally synthesised peptides, post-translationally modified proteins, expressed or synthesised proteins containing unnatural amino acids, and peptides and proteins that are chemically modified. Here, we describe a general procedure for generating atomic descriptions required to incorporate ncAAs within popular NMR structure determination software such as CYANA, CNS, Xplor-NIH and ARIA. This procedure is made publicly available via the existing Automated Topology Builder (ATB) server (https://atb.uq.edu.au, last access: 17 February 2023) with all submitted ncAAs stored in a dedicated database. The described procedure also includes a general method for linking of side\u00a0chains of amino acids from CYANA templates. To ensure compatibility with other systems, atom names comply with IUPAC guidelines. In addition to describing the workflow, 3D models of complex natural products generated by CYANA are presented, including vancomycin. In order to demonstrate the manner in which the templates for ncAAs generated by the ATB can be used in practice, we use a combination of CYANA and CNS to solve the structure of a synthetic peptide designed to disrupt Alzheimer-related protein-protein interactions. Automating the generation of structural templates for ncAAs will extend the utility of NMR spectroscopy to studies of more complex biomolecules, with applications in the rapidly growing fields of synthetic biology and chemical biology. The procedures we outline can also be used to standardise the creation of structural templates for any amino acid and thus have the potential to impact structural biology more generally.",

Neuroinflammation is known to play a significant role in these disorders. The literature review for this study was conducted by searching Scopus, Science Direct, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases. The results of this study show that Gem has neuroprotective effects through several cellular and molecular mechanisms such as: (1) Gem has the ability to upregulate pro-survival factors (PGC-1\u03b1 and TFAM), promoting the survival and function of mitochondria in the brain, (2) Gem strongly inhibits the activation of NF-\u03baB, AP-1, and C/EBP\u03b2 in cytokine-stimulated astroglial cells, which are known to increase the expression of iNOS and the production of NO in response to proinflammatory cytokines, (3) Gem protects dopamine neurons in the MPTP mouse model of PD by increasing the expression of PPAR\u03b1, which in turn stimulates the production of GDNF in astrocytes, (4) Gem reduces amyloid plaque pathology, reduces the activity of glial cells, and improves memory, (5) Gem increases myelin genes expression (MBP and CNPase) via PPAR-\u03b2, and (6) Gem increases hippocampal BDNF to counteract depression.

Here, we investigated the role of survivin in the modulation of hippocampal neurogenesis in AD. To investigate the effect of survivin on neurogenesis in neural stem cells (NSCs), we treated mouse embryonic NSCs with a survivin inhibitor (YM155) and adeno-associated viral survivin (AAV-Survivin). To explore the potential role of survivin expression in AD, AAV9-Survivin or AAV9-GFP were injected into the dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus of 7-month-old wild-type and 5XFAD mice. Cognitive function was measured by the Y maze and Morris water maze. Neurogenesis was investigated by BrdU staining, immature, and mature neuron markers. Our results indicate that suppression of survivin expression resulted in decreased neurogenesis. Conversely, overexpression of survivin using AAV-Survivin restored neurogenesis in NSCs that had been suppressed by YM155 treatment. Furthermore, the expression level of survivin decreased in the 9-month-old 5XFAD compared with that in wild-type mice. AAV-Survivin-mediated overexpression of survivin in the DG in 5XFAD mice enhanced neurogenesis and cognitive function.

The brain correlates of these non-image-forming effects have been investigated, notably using magnetic resonance imaging and short light exposures varying in irradiance and spectral quality. However, it is not clear whether non-image-forming responses estimation may be biased by having light in sequential blocks, for example, through a potential carryover effect of one light onto the next. We reasoned that pupil light reflex was an easy readout of one of the non-image-forming effects of light that could be used to address this issue. We characterised the sustained pupil light reflex in 13-16 healthy young individuals under short light exposures during three distinct cognitive processes (executive, emotional and attentional). Light conditions pseudo-randomly alternated between monochromatic orange light (0.16 melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance lux) and polychromatic blue-enriched white light of three different levels (37, 92, 190 melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance lux). As expected, higher melanopic irradiance was associated with larger sustained pupil light reflex in each cognitive domain. This result was stable over the light sequence under higher melanopic irradiance levels compared with lower ones. Exploratory frequency-domain analyses further revealed that sustained pupil light reflex was more variable under lower melanopic irradiance levels. Importantly, sustained pupil light reflex varied across tasks independently of the light condition, pointing to a potential impact of light history and/or cognitive context on sustained pupil light reflex. Together, our results emphasise that the distinct contribution and adaptation of the different retinal photoreceptors influence the non-image-forming effects of light and therefore potentially their brain correlates.",

A range of prior positions were then updated according to Bayes' theorem using these estimates. After updating with new trial data, a wide range of starting positions resulted in credible intervals that did not include no effect of amyloid reduction on CDR-SB score. For a range of starting beliefs and assuming the veracity of the underlying data, rational observers would conclude there is a small benefit of amyloid reductions on cognition. This benefit must be weighed against opportunity cost and side-effect risk. The results of recent trials of amyloid-targeting drugs have rekindled discussion on the impact of amyloid reductions achieved with amyloid-targeting drugs on cognition. Prior to the announcement of trial results, beliefs about the effects of altering amyloid levels varied. For a range of starting beliefs, one would conclude there is a small benefit of amyloid reductions due to amyloid-targeting drugs on cognition. The perceived value of individual drugs must balance the magnitude of this benefit against opportunity cost and risk of side effects.",

        "AbstractText": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a heterogeneous disorder and the phenotypic variability goes far beyond the used clinical stratification parameter. Evidence has emerged that ALS may coexist with distinct neurodegenerative diseases in single cases. We aim to study the clinical features of two familial cases of ALS carriers of two distinct variants harbored in the Optineurin (OPTN) gene. We included definite familial ALS followed up in the Department of Neurology of Razi University Hospital, Tunisia, and selected according to Byrne criteria. Preliminary screening for the four main ALS genes (SOD1, C9ORF72, TARDBP, FUS) was conducted. Given the negative results, we proceeded to NGS target-re-sequencing with a custom panel including genes associated with ALS-FTD, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. Both families are carriers of two different OPTN variants and they present very different ALS clinical features. The first family comprises two siblings diagnosed with ALS and Corticobasal syndrome (ALS-CBS) at an early age of onset and carriers of OPTN p.E135X in the homozygous state. The proband for the second family was diagnosed with ALS at an early age of onset presenting as progressive muscular atrophy with rapid progression. Genetic analysis revealed the presence of the homozygous variant p.R520H.Our findings highlight the peculiarity of genetic Tunisian drift. Indeed, genes with a recessive mode of inheritance may explain part of ALS diversity in clinical features. Therefore, the screening of the OPTN gene is highly recommended among inbreeding populations such as the Tunisian one.",

        "AbstractText": "The high mutation rate throughout the entire melanoma genome presents a major challenge in stratifying true driver events from the background mutations. Numerous recurrent non-coding alterations, such as those in enhancers, can shape tumor evolution, thereby emphasizing the importance in systematically deciphering enhancer disruptions in melanoma. Here, we leveraged 297 melanoma whole-genome sequencing samples to prioritize highly recurrent regions. By performing a genome-scale CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen on highly recurrent region-associated enhancers in melanoma cells, we identified 66 significant hits which could have tumor-suppressive roles. These functional enhancers show unique mutational patterns independent of classical significantly mutated genes in melanoma. Target gene analysis for the essential enhancers reveal many known and hidden mechanisms underlying melanoma growth. Utilizing extensive functional validation experiments, we demonstrate that a super enhancer element could modulate melanoma cell proliferation by targeting MEF2A, and another distal enhancer is able to sustain PTEN tumor-suppressive potential via long-range interactions. Our study establishes a catalogue of crucial enhancers and their target genes in melanoma growth and progression, and illuminates the identification of novel mechanisms of dysregulation for melanoma driver genes and new therapeutic targeting strategies.",

Cryo-electron microscopic (cryo-EM) studies have demonstrated that tau filaments extracted from tauopathy brains are characteristic of the disease and share a common fold(s) in the same disease group. Furthermore, the tau PTM profile changes during tau pathology formation and disease progression, and disease-specific PTMs are detected in and around the filament core. In addition, templated seeding has been suggested to trigger pathological tau amplification and spreading in vitro and in vivo, although the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Recently, we reported that the cryo-EM structures of tau protofilaments in SH-SY5Y cells seeded with patient-derived tau filaments show a core structure(s) resembling that of the original seeds. Here, we investigated PTMs of tau filaments accumulated in the seeded cells by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and compared them with the PTMs of patient-derived tau filaments. Examination of insoluble tau extracted from SH-SY5Y cells showed that numerous phosphorylation, deamidation and oxidation sites detected in the fuzzy coat in the original seeds were well reproduced in SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, templated tau filament formation preceded both truncation of the N-/C-terminals of tau and PTMs in and around the filament core, indicating these PTMs may predominantly be introduced after the degradation of the fuzzy coat.",

        "AbstractText": "Genotypes are strongly associated with disease phenotypes, particularly in brain disorders. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind this association remain elusive. With emerging multimodal data for these mechanisms, machine learning methods can be applied for phenotype prediction at different scales, but due to the black-box nature of machine learning, integrating these modalities and interpreting biological mechanisms can be challenging. Additionally, the partial availability of these multimodal data presents a challenge in developing these predictive models. To address these challenges, we developed DeepGAMI, an interpretable neural network model to improve genotype-phenotype prediction from multimodal data. DeepGAMI leverages functional genomic information, such as eQTLs and gene regulation, to guide neural network connections. Additionally, it includes an auxiliary learning layer for cross-modal imputation allowing the imputation of latent features of missing modalities and thus predicting phenotypes from a single modality. Finally, DeepGAMI uses integrated gradient to prioritize multimodal features for various phenotypes. We applied DeepGAMI to several multimodal datasets including genotype and bulk and cell-type gene expression data in brain diseases, and gene expression and electrophysiology data of mouse neuronal cells. Using cross-validation and independent validation, DeepGAMI outperformed existing methods for classifying disease types, and cellular and clinical phenotypes, even using single modalities (e.g., AUC score of 0.79 for Schizophrenia and 0.73 for cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease). We demonstrated that DeepGAMI improves phenotype prediction and prioritizes phenotypic features and networks in multiple multimodal datasets in complex brains and brain diseases. Also, it prioritized disease-associated variants, genes, and regulatory networks linked to different phenotypes, providing novel insights into the interpretation of gene regulatory mechanisms. DeepGAMI is open-source and available for general use.",

This study aimed primarily to explore whether the roles of pets for LTCH-clients who own pets are comparable to the roles of pets for older adults in the general population. Furthermore, we explored potential pet-related problems that might be encountered in LTCH in practice, and the potential influences of pet ownership on caregiving relationships. These insights may help improve long-term care services in LTCH. This project started with a study using the Consensual Qualitative Research method (CQR). We conducted semi-structured interviews based on themes from our previous review (e.g., Relational Aspects, Emotional Aspects, and Social Aspects). Secondly, an online survey was used to confirm the findings from the CQR study by calculating Content Validity Index scores (in SPSS 26) regarding contents, relevance, and clarity. The survey also included open-ended questions on potential pet-related problems and their impact on caregiving relationships for LTCH-clients, family caregivers, and professional caregivers. The CQR study found that the roles pets play for LTCH-clients (N\u2009=\u20098), family caregivers (N\u2009=\u200910), and professional caregivers (N\u2009=\u200910) were similar to the roles pets play for older adults in the general population.

The roles pets play for LTCH-clients seem comparable to the roles pets play for older adults in the general population. In addition, LTCH-clients might experience pet-related problems specific to the LTCH context. Pets may influence caregiving relationships, either positively or negatively.

Information on AD prediction at the individual patient level will be useful in AD prevention. In this study, we aim to develop risk models for predicting AD onset at individual level using optimal set of predictors from multiple features. A total of 487 cognitively normal (CN) individuals and 796 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients were included from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. All the participants were assessed for clinical, cognitive, magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers and followed for mean periods of 5.6\u00a0years for CN individuals and 4.6\u00a0years for MCI patients to ascertain progression from CN to incident prodromal stage of AD or from MCI to AD dementia. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Cox regression was applied for predictors selection and model construction. During the follow-up periods, 139 CN participants had progressed to prodromal AD (CDR\u2009\u2265\u20090.5) and 321 MCI patients had progressed to AD dementia. In the prediction of individual risk of incident prodromal stage of AD in CN individuals, the AUC of the final CN model was 0.81 within 5\u00a0years.

It is estimated that one in three elderly people die from AD or other dementias. Chinese herbal medicine as a potential drug for treating AD has gained growing interest from many researchers. Moschus, a rare and valuable traditional Chinese animal medicine, was originally documented in Shennong Ben Cao Jing and recognized for its properties of reviving consciousness/resuscitation. Additionally, Moschus has the efficacy of \"regulation of menstruation with blood activation, relief of swelling and pain\" and is used for treating unconsciousness, stroke, coma, and cerebrovascular diseases. However, it is uncertain whether Moschus has any protective effect on AD patients. We explored whether Moschus could protect glutamate (Glu)-induced PC12 cells from cellular injury and preliminarily explored their related action mechanisms. The chemical compounds of Moschus were analyzed and identified by GC-MS. The Glu-induced differentiated PC12 cell model was thought to be the common AD cellular model. The study aims to preliminarily investigate the intervention effect of Moschus on Glu-induced PC12 cell damage as well as their related action mechanisms. Cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), cell apoptosis, autophagic vacuoles, autolysosomes or autophagosomes, proteins related to apoptosis, and the proteins related to autophagy were examined and analyzed. Seventeen active compounds of the Moschus sample were identified based on GC-MS analysis. In comparison to the control group, Glu stimulation increased cell viability loss, LDH release, mitochondrial damage, loss of MMP, apoptosis rate, and the number of cells containing autophagic vacuoles, and autolysosomes or autophagosomes, while these results were decreased after the pretreatment with Moschus and 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Furthermore, Glu stimulation significantly increased cleaved caspase-3, Beclin1, and LC3II protein expression, and reduced B-cell lymphoma 2/BAX ratio and p62 protein expression, but these results were reversed after pretreatment of Moschus and 3-MA. Moschus has protective activity in Glu-induced PC12 cell injury, and the potential mechanism might involve the regulation of autophagy and apoptosis.

The brain structures involved in the physiopathology of apathy have also been connected to the brain structures involved in probabilistic reward learning in the exploration-exploitation dilemma. This dilemma in question involves the challenge of selecting between a familiar option with a more predictable outcome, and another option whose outcome is uncertain and may yield potentially greater rewards compared to the known option. The aim of this study was to combine experimental procedures and computational modeling to examine whether, in older adults with mild neurocognitive disorders, apathy affects performance in the exploration-exploitation dilemma. Through using a four-armed bandit reinforcement-learning task, we showed that apathetic older adults explored more and performed worse than non-apathetic subjects. Moreover, the mental flexibility assessed by the Trail-making test-B was negatively associated with the percentage of exploration. These results suggest that apathy is characterized by an increased explorative behavior and inefficient decision-making, possibly due to weak mental flexibility to switch toward the exploitation of the more rewarding options. Apathetic participants also took longer to make a choice and failed more often to respond in the allotted time, which could reflect the difficulties in action initiation and selection. In conclusion, the present results suggest that apathy in participants with neurocognitive disorders is associated with specific disturbances in the exploration-exploitation trade-off and sheds light on the disturbances in reward processing in patients with apathy.",

Here, we show that neuregulin-1, a glial growth factor, induces inflammatory cytokines and promotes phagocytic activity in vitro and augments microglial activation and plaque formation in 5XFAD Alzheimer's mice. Brain-specific targeting of neuregulin-1 by intraventricular delivery of a novel neuregulin-1 fusion protein antagonist GlyB4 significantly alters microglial morphology and function to a non-pathogenic morphology in early-stage 5XFAD mice and prevents plaques from forming. Once plaques have already formed, GlyB4 reduces new plaque formation and prevents synaptic loss. Selective, targeted disruption of neuregulin-1 signaling on brain microglia with GlyB4 could be a novel 'upstream' approach to slow or stop disease progression in Alzheimer's disease.Significance StatementMicroglia-associated neuroinflammation is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.

Inhibition of NRG1 using a targeted NRG1 antagonist called GlyB4 blocks NRG1 receptor activation in microglia, reduces Amyloid \u03b2 plaque formation, and prevents synaptic loss. While NRG1 clearly has important functions at other sites in the nervous system, excessive NRG1 signaling in microglia leads to pathological neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.

While a popular therapeutic target, it is unknown whether molecular mechanisms leading to disrupted L-VGCC across neurodegenerative disorders are conserved. Importantly, L-VGCC integrate synaptic signals to facilitate a plethora of cellular mechanisms; however, mechanisms that regulate L-VGCC channel density and subcellular compartmentalization are understudied. Herein, we report that in disease models with overactive mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling (or mTORopathies), deficits in dendritic L-VGCC activity are associated with increased expression of the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Parkinsonism-associated deglycase (DJ-1).

This study included 27 former NFL players and 27 former elite, noncollision sport athletes. Regional TSPO levels were higher in former NFL players compared with former elite, noncollision sport athletes (unstandardized \u03b2 coefficient, 1.08; SE,\u20090.22; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.52; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The magnitude of the group difference depended on region, with largest group differences in TSPO in cingulate and frontal cortices as well as hippocampus. Compared with noncollision sport athletes, former NFL players performed worse in learning (mean difference [MD], -0.70; 95% CI, -1.14 to -0.25; P\u2009=\u2009.003) and memory (MD, -0.77; 95% CI, -1.24 to -0.30; P\u2009=\u2009.002), with no correlation between total gray matter TSPO and these cognitive domains. In this cross-sectional study using [11C]DPA-713 PET, higher brain TSPO was found in former NFL players compared with noncollision sport athletes. This finding is consistent with neuroimmune activation even after cessation of NFL play. Future longitudinal [11C]DPA-713 PET and neuropsychological testing promises to inform whether neuroimmune-modulating therapy may be warranted.",

        "AbstractText": "Slow-wave sleep (SWS) supports the aging brain in many ways, including facilitating the glymphatic clearance of proteins that aggregate in Alzheimer disease. However, the role of SWS in the development of dementia remains equivocal. To determine whether SWS loss with aging is associated with the risk of incident dementia and examine whether Alzheimer disease genetic risk or hippocampal volumes suggestive of early neurodegeneration were associated with SWS loss. This prospective cohort study included participants in the Framingham Heart Study who completed 2 overnight polysomnography (PSG) studies in the time periods 1995 to 1998 and 1998 to 2001. Additional criteria for individuals in this study sample were an age of 60 years or older and no dementia at the time of the second overnight PSG. Data analysis was performed from January 2020 to August 2023. Changes in SWS percentage measured across repeated overnight sleep studies over a mean of 5.2 years apart (range, 4.8-7.1 years). Risk of incident all-cause dementia adjudicated over 17 years of follow-up from the second PSG. From the 868 Framingham Heart Study participants who returned for a second PSG, this cohort included 346 participants with a mean age of 69 years (range, 60-87 years); 179 (52%) were female. Aging was associated with SWS loss across repeated overnight sleep studies (mean [SD] change, -0.6 [1.5%] per year; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Over the next 17 years of follow-up, there were 52 cases of incident dementia. In Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, cohort, positivity for at least 1 APOE \u03b54 allele, smoking status, sleeping medication use, antidepressant use, and anxiolytic use, each percentage decrease in SWS per year was associated with a 27% increase in the risk of dementia (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.06-1.54; P\u2009=\u2009.01). SWS loss with aging was accelerated in the presence of Alzheimer disease genetic risk (ie, APOE \u03b54 allele) but not hippocampal volumes measured proximal to the first PSG. This cohort study found that slow-wave sleep percentage declined with aging and Alzheimer disease genetic risk, with greater reductions associated with the risk of incident dementia. These findings suggest that SWS loss may be a modifiable dementia risk factor.",

To evaluate the effect of tau synthesis reduction on tau biomarkers in patients with mild AD. This randomized clinical trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled 36-week multiple-ascending dose (MAD) phase 1b trial (October 2017 to September 2020), followed by a 64- or 71-week open-label long-term extension (LTE) (October 2019 to May 2022). After being assessed for eligibility at 12 sites in Canada and Europe, participants with mild AD and confirmed amyloid pathology were randomized 3:1 (BIIB080:placebo) in 4 dose cohorts. Intrathecal administration of BIIB080, a MAPT-targeting antisense oligonucleotide, or placebo. Active dose arms included 10 mg every 4 weeks, 30 mg every 4 weeks, 60 mg every 4 weeks, and 115 mg every 12 weeks during the MAD period and 60 mg every 12 weeks or 115 mg every 12 weeks during the LTE. The original primary end point was safety. Additionally, BIIB080, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations were evaluated. Tau positron emission tomography (PET) was collected in a substudy, and standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated in a priori-defined composite regions of interest. Of 102 participants assessed for eligibility, 46 participants with mild AD were enrolled; 23 (50%) were female, and mean (SD) age was 65.8 (5.70) years. BIIB080 was generally well tolerated and was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in CSF t-tau and p-tau181 in the MAD period (56% reduction; 95% CI, 50% to 62%; and 51% reduction; 95% CI, 38% to 63%, of CSF t-tau in the 2 higher-dose cohorts) that continued and/or was maintained through quarterly dosing in the LTE. Tau PET demonstrated reduced accumulation vs placebo at week 25 (n\u2009=\u200913). At week 100, tau PET showed a reduction from baseline across all regions assessed (n\u2009=\u200912), with the largest reductions from baseline observed in the temporal composite (-0.71 SUVR; 95% CI, -1.40 to -0.02). A moderate correlation was observed between model-predicted cumulative CSF drug exposure and tau PET change. In this randomized clinical trial, BIIB080 reduced tau biomarkers, including CSF t-tau, CSF p-tau181, and tau PET, which is associated with cognitive decline, in participants with mild AD. Effects of BIIB080 on biomarkers and clinical outcomes are being further evaluated in a phase 2 trial. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03186989.",

This study aimed to examine the neuroprotective efficacy of ROP in a stereotaxis model of AD. The Wistar rats were randomly assigned into four groups. Group I was considered as a sham, group II served as A\u03b2-infusion alone, Group III was A\u03b21-42 + ROP (5\u2009mg/kg/i.p.), and Group IV was A\u03b21-42 + ROP (10\u2009mg/kg/i.p.). Our research revealed that ROP (10\u2009mg/kg, b.wt.) attenuates the cognitive deficits caused by A\u03b21-42 -infused, which also correlates with the barnes maze, where (10\u2009mg/kg, b.w.t.) shows significant improvement in spatial learning and memory. At the same time, ROP was rescued from oxidative damage, decreased lipid peroxidation rates, and inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity caused, demonstrating antioxidant benefits. In addition, a higher dose of ROP restored mitochondrial membrane potential in A\u03b21-42 rats. Furthermore, histopathological examination showed that ROP treatment reduced neuronal loss, especially in the hippocampus. We conclude that ROP's protective effects in reducing oxidative stress and modulating mitochondrial function might have a propensity in AD pathogenesis.",

        "AbstractText": "Neurodevelopment can be precisely regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylations, noncoding RNAs and histone modifications. Histone methylation was a reversible modification, catalyzed by histone methyltransferases and demethylases. So far, dozens of histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) have been discovered, and they (members from KDM1 to KDM7 family) are important for neurodevelopment by regulating cellular processes such as chromatin structure and gene transcription. The role of KDM5C and KDM7B in neural development is particularly important, and mutations in both genes are frequently found in human X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). Functional disorders of specific KDMs such as KDM1A can lead to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Several KDMs can serve as potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. At present, the function of KDMs in neurodegenerative diseases is not fully understood, so more comprehensive and profound studies are needed. Here, the role and mechanism of histone demethylases were summarized on neurodevelopment, and the potential of them was introduced on treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Nine out of eighteen derivatives (6-8, 10, 12-15, 18) are novel molecules synthesized for the first time in this work, and other derivatives were previously synthesized by our group. The compounds were characterized by Proton nuclear magnetic resonance, carbon nuclear magnetic resonance, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. All compounds were tested for their in vitro cytotoxicity against PC-3 (human prostate adenocarcinoma), A549 (human alveolar adenocarcinoma), and SHSY-5Y (human neuroblastoma) cancer cell lines and the nontumorigenic HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cells) cell line. The 3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde derived compound (8) was toxic to PC-3 human prostate adenocarcinoma cells, showing a promising IC50 value at 7.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.76\u2009\u03bcM. The present study also aimed to evaluate the inhibitory effects of the compounds against several key enzymes, namely carbonic anhydrase I and II (CA I and CA II), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and glutathione reductase (GR), which are implicated in various global disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, cancer, malaria, diabetes, and glaucoma. The inhibitory profiles of the tested compounds were assessed by determining their Ki values, which ranged from 2.96 to 9.24\u2009nM for AChE, 3.78 to 12.57\u2009nM for BChE, 8.42 to 25.74\u2009nM for CA I, 7.24 to 19.74\u2009nM for CA II, and 0.541 to 1.124\u2009\u03bcM for GR. Molecular docking studies were also performed for all compounds. Most derivatives exhibited much more effective inhibitory action compared with clinically used standards.

        "AbstractText": "Spatial navigation is a complex function involving the integration and manipulation of multisensory information. Using different navigation tasks, many promising results have been achieved on the specific functions of various brain regions (e.g., hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal place area). Recently, it has been suggested that a non-aggregate network process involving multiple interacting brain regions may better characterize the neural basis of this complex function. This paper presents an integrative approach for constructing and analyzing the functionally-specific network for spatial navigation in the human brain. Briefly, this integrative approach consists of three major steps: 1) to identify brain regions important for spatial navigation (nodes definition); 2) to estimate functional connectivity between each pair of these regions and construct the connectivity matrix (network construction); 3) to investigate the topological properties (e.g., modularity and small worldness) of the resulting network (network analysis). The presented approach, from a network perspective, could help us better understand how our brain supports flexible navigation in complex and dynamic environments, and the revealed topological properties of the network can also provide important biomarkers for guiding early identification and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice.",

Neurofilament, a potential biomarker for neurological disorders, has gained attention. Our study aims to investigate the relationship between serum neurofilament light (sNfL) levels and cognitive function in elderly individuals in the United States. This cross-sectional study analyzed data from participants aged 60 and above in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2013-2014). We collected sNfL levels, cognitive function tests, sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and other variables. Weighted multiple linear regression models examined the relationship between ln(sNfL) and cognitive scores. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) visualization explored nonlinear relationships. The stratified analysis examined subgroups' ln(sNfL) and cognitive function association. The study included 446 participants (47.73% male). Participants with ln(sNfL) levels between 2.58 and 2.81\u2009pg/mL (second quintile) performed relatively well in cognitive tests. After adjusting for multiple factors, ln(sNfL) levels were negatively correlated with cognitive function, with adjusted \u03b2 (95% CI) as follows: immediate recall test (IRT): -0.763 (-1.301 to -0.224), delayed recall test (DRT): -0.308 (-0.576 to -0.04), animal fluency test (AFT): -1.616 (-2.639 to -0.594), and digit symbol substitution test (DSST): -2.790 (-4.369 to -1.21). RCS curves showed nonlinear relationships between ln(sNfL) and DRT, AFT, with inflection points around 2.7\u2009pg/mL. The stratified analysis revealed a negative correlation between ln(sNfL) and cognition in specific subgroups with distinct features, with an interaction between diabetes and ln(sNfL). Higher sNfL levels are associated with poorer cognitive function in the elderly population of the United States. sNfL shows promise as a potential biomarker for early identification of cognitive decline.",

This article aims to provide a systematic review of the efficacy, and safety of lecanemab in slowing clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease. A comprehensive search of various databases, including the National Institute of Health clinical trials registry, PubMed, and the Cochrane library, was conducted until July 2023 using the keywords lecanemab, BAN2401, and Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, conference abstracts listed in the Cochrane database (including Embase) and drug information from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label were examined. Only clinical trials published in the English language were considered. In total, 107 articles were retrieved, and after thorough evaluation, three randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trials involving 2729 participants were included in the analysis. The FDA approved lecanemab for Alzheimer's disease in January 2023 which acts as a novel disease-modifying anti-amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) human monoclonal antibody and is administered intravenously. Based on the clinical trials included in this review, lecanemab was found efficacious in reducing the accumulation of beta-amyloid and slowing down the cognitive decline and it was well tolerated. Lecanemab had a statistically significant change from baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAScog14), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL), and reductions in brain amyloid burden. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were headache, infusion-related reactions, and Amyloid related imaging abnormalities-edema. Lecanemab therapy led to a substantial decrease in amyloid plaques and a noticeable slowing of clinical decline. The findings suggest a meaningful connection between the reduction in amyloid and the positive impact on patients' clinical outcomes, hinting at potential disease-modifying effects.",

However, the efficacy of dementia-specific interventions is influenced in part by the degree to which the interventions are flexible and sensitive to the patient's and care-partner's condition, needs, and preferences, including cultural preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess the cultural appropriateness of Fam-FFC using the Ecological Validity Model (EVM). This qualitative, descriptive study included 28 consented care partners drawn from a sample of 455 dyads enrolled in the Fam-FFC intervention. An interview guide was created based on the EVM.

Exposure to stress during this critical time window can alter brain development and may enhance the susceptibility to psychopathology and neurodegenerative disorders later in life. The developmental effects of early life stress (ELS) on synaptic function are not fully understood, but could provide mechanistic insights into how ELS modifies later brain function and disease risk. We here assessed the effects of ELS on synaptic function and composition in the hippocampus of male mice. Mice were subjected to ELS by housing dams and pups with limited bedding and nesting material from postnatal days (P) 2-9. Synaptic strength was measured in terms of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus at three different developmental stages: the early postnatal phase (P9), preadolescence (P21, at weaning) and adulthood at 3\u2009months of age (3MO). Hippocampal synaptosome fractions were isolated from P9 and 3MO tissue and analyzed for protein content to assess postsynaptic composition. Finally, dendritic spine density was assessed in the DG at 3MO. At P9, ELS increased mEPSC frequency and amplitude. In parallel, synaptic composition was altered as PSD-95, GluA3 and GluN2B content were significantly decreased. The increased mEPSC frequency was sustained up to 3MO, at which age, GluA3 content was significantly increased. No differences were found in dendritic spine density. These findings highlight how ELS affects the development of hippocampal synapses, which could provide valuable insight into mechanisms how ELS alters brain function later in life.",

This has created an increasing demand for alternative, human-based models capable of emulating key pathological phenotypes in vitro. Here, a three-dimensional Alzheimer's disease model was developed using a compartmentalized microfluidic device that combines a self-assembled microvascular network of the human blood-brain barrier with neurospheres derived from Alzheimer's disease-specific neural progenitor cells. To shorten microfluidic co-culture times, neurospheres were pre-differentiated for 21\u00a0days to express Alzheimer's disease-specific pathological phenotypes prior to the introduction into the microfluidic device. In agreement with post-mortem studies and Alzheimer's disease in vivo models, after 7\u00a0days of co-culture with pre-differentiated Alzheimer's disease-specific neurospheres, the three-dimensional blood-brain barrier network exhibited significant changes in barrier permeability and morphology. Furthermore, vascular networks in co-culture with Alzheimer's disease-specific microtissues displayed localized \u03b2-amyloid deposition. Thus, by interconnecting a microvascular network of the blood-brain barrier with pre-differentiated neurospheres the presented model holds immense potential for replicating key neurovascular phenotypes of neurodegenerative disorders in vitro.",

A\u03b2 deposition on PET was considered as an outcome. Females had a higher frequency of NAFLD than males (48 and 23.2%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Among females, the presence of NAFLD (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.216, p\u2009<\u20090.001) was predictive of increased A\u03b2 deposition, whereas among males, the presence of NAFLD (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.191, p\u2009=\u20090.064) was not associated with A\u03b2 deposition. Among females, the presence of NAFLD with low (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.254, p\u2009=\u20090.039), intermediate (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.201, p\u2009=\u20090.006), and high fibrosis (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.257, p\u2009=\u20090.027) was predictive of increased A\u03b2 deposition. A\u03b2 deposition also increased as the severity of NAFLD increased in females (p for trend\u2009=\u20090.001). We highlight the marked influence of NAFLD and its severity on the risk of A\u03b2 deposition in relation to sex. Furthermore, our findings suggest that sex-specific strategies regarding the management of NAFLD are necessary for the prevention of A\u03b2 deposition.",

        "AbstractText": "There is an urgent need to improve the translational validity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models. Introducing genetic background diversity in AD mouse models has been proposed as a way to increase validity and enable the discovery of previously uncharacterized genetic contributions to AD susceptibility or resilience. However, the extent to which genetic background influences the mouse brain proteome and its perturbation in AD mouse models is unknown. In this study, we crossed the 5XFAD AD mouse model on a C57BL/6J (B6) inbred background with the DBA/2J (D2) inbred background and analyzed the effects of genetic background variation on the brain proteome in F1 progeny. Both genetic background and 5XFAD transgene insertion strongly affected protein variance in the hippocampus and cortex (n = 3,368 proteins). Protein co-expression network analysis identified 16 modules of highly co-expressed proteins common across the hippocampus and cortex in 5XFAD and non-transgenic mice. Among the modules strongly influenced by genetic background were those related to small molecule metabolism and ion transport. Modules strongly influenced by the 5XFAD transgene were related to lysosome/stress responses and neuronal synapse/signaling. The modules with the strongest relationship to human disease-neuronal synapse/signaling and lysosome/stress response-were not significantly influenced by genetic background. However, other modules in 5XFAD that were related to human disease, such as GABA synaptic signaling and mitochondrial membrane modules, were influenced by genetic background. Most disease-related modules were more strongly correlated with AD genotype in the hippocampus compared with the cortex. Our findings suggest that the genetic diversity introduced by crossing B6 and D2 inbred backgrounds influences proteomic changes related to disease in the 5XFAD model, and that proteomic analysis of other genetic backgrounds in transgenic and knock-in AD mouse models is warranted to capture the full range of molecular heterogeneity in genetically diverse models of AD.",

        "AbstractText": "The lysosomal protein TMEM106B was identified as a risk modifier of multiple dementias including frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The gene comes in two major haplotypes, one associated with disease risk, and by comparison, the other with resilience. Only one coding polymorphism distinguishes the two alleles, a threonine-to-serine substitution at residue 185 (186 in mouse), that is inherited in disequilibrium with multiple non-coding variants. Transcriptional studies suggest synaptic, neuronal, and cognitive preservation in human subjects with the protective haplotype, while murine in vitro studies reveal dramatic effects of TMEM106B deletion on neuronal development. Despite this foundation, the field has not yet resolved whether coding variant is biologically meaningful, and if so, whether it has any specific effect on neuronal phenotypes. Here we studied how loss of TMEM106B or expression of the lone coding variant in isolation affected transcriptional signatures in the mature brain and neuronal structure during development in primary neurons. Homozygous expression of the TMEM106B T186S variant in knock-in mice increased cortical expression of genes associated with excitatory synaptic function and axon outgrowth, and promoted neurite branching, dendritic spine density, and synaptic density in primary hippocampal neurons. In contrast, constitutive TMEM106B deletion affected transcriptional signatures of myelination without altering neuronal development in vitro. Our findings show that the T186S variant is functionally relevant and may contribute to disease resilience during neurodevelopment.",

We also investigated whether the automatically calculated speech and linguistic features had an additional value compared to the commonly used total scores in a semiautomated phone assessment. We included 94 participants from the memory clinic of the Maastricht University Medical Center+ (SCD N = 56 and MCI N = 38). The test leader guided the participant through a semiautomated phone assessment. The VLT and SVF were audio recorded and processed via a mobile application. The recall count and speech and linguistic features were automatically extracted. The diagnostic groups were classified by training machine learning classifiers to differentiate SCD and MCI participants. The intraclass correlation for inter-rater reliability between the manual and the ASR total word count was 0.89 (95% CI 0.09-0.97) for the VLT immediate recall, 0.94 (95% CI 0.68-0.98) for the VLT delayed recall, and 0.93 (95% CI 0.56-0.97) for the SVF. The full model including the total word count and speech and linguistic features had an area under the curve of 0.81 and 0.77 for the VLT immediate and delayed recall, respectively, and 0.61 for the SVF. There was a high agreement between the ASR and manual scores, keeping the broad confidence intervals in mind. The phone-based VLT was able to differentiate between SCD and MCI and can have opportunities for clinical trial screening.",

The Look AHEAD Aging study is designed to identify 20-year trajectories of behaviors, risk factors, and medical history associated with resilience against geriatric syndromes and aging-related cognitive and physical functional deficits among individuals with these conditions. Look AHEAD Aging extends follow-up of the cohort of the former 10-year Look AHEAD trial. The original cohort (N = 5145) was enrolled in 2001 to 2004 when participants were aged 45 to 76 years and randomly assigned to a multidomain intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) or a diabetes support and education (DSE) condition. The trial interventions ceased in 2012. Clinic-based follow-up continued through 2020. In 2021, the cohort was invited to enroll in Look AHEAD Aging, an additional 4-year telephone-based follow-up (every 6 months) enhanced with Medicare linkage. Standardized protocols assess multimorbidity, physical and cognitive function, health care utilization, and health-related quality of life. Of the original N = 5145 Look AHEAD participants, N = 1552 active survivors agreed to participate in Look AHEAD Aging. At consent, the cohort's mean age was 76 (range 63 to 94) years and participants had been followed for a mean of 20 years. Of the original Look AHEAD enrollees, those who were younger, female, or with no history of cardiovascular disease were more likely to be represented in the Look AHEAD Aging cohort. Intervention groups were comparable with respect to age, diabetes duration, body mass index, insulin use, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive function. ILI participants had significantly lower deficit accumulation index scores. By continuing the long-term follow-up of an extensively characterized cohort of older individuals with type 2 diabetes, Look AHEAD Aging is well positioned to identify factors associated with resilience against aging-related conditions.",

Endothelial cell dysfunction-induced blood-brain barrier leak with associated prolonged capillary mean transit time (cMTT) and glymphatic outflow dysfunction is the most proximal events in the degeneration cascade. Sensitive and reproducible markers are required to both identify early disease and assess future treatment trial outcomes. Two participants, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and one with AD, were evaluated clinically prior to MRI in this small case series report. From seven 3D turbo gradient and spin echo (TGSE) pulsed arterial spin echo (PASL) MRI sequences six homologous region of interest in bitemporal, bifrontal, and biparietal lobes for each sequence were examined and plotted against time. By choosing late perfusion times during cMTT phase of perfusion linear analysis of signal decay could be utilized. A reference axial FLAIR sequence was also obtained. Slope of the linear analysis correlated to the rate of labeled proton clearance with reduced clearance occurring in AD participants compared to normal participants in our previous study. Whether similar differences in clearance rate extend to either MCI or early AD was investigated. Participants were categorized by clinical phenotype before MRI and compared to previously published phenotype cohorts: n = 18 normal/healthy, n = 6 AD, n = 3 MCI. Significant differences in labeled proton clearance rates between AD and MCI/control phenotypes within bilateral temporal lobes (left p = 0.004, right p = 0.002) and within bilateral frontal lobes AD versus controls (left p = 0.001, right p = 0.008) and AD versus MCI (left p = 0.001, right p = 0.001) were found.

However, it remains unknown whether dementia-associated diseases alter neuro-immune reflex arcs to impact the systemic immune system. We examined peripheral immune cells from a community-based cohort of older adults to test if systemic inflammatory cytokine signatures associated with early stages of cognitive impairment. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured with monocyte or T-cell-targeted stimuli, and multiplex assays quantitated cytokines in the conditioned media. Following T-cell-targeted stimulation, cells from women with cognitive impairment produced lower amounts of TH17 cytokines compared with cells from cognitively healthy women, while myeloid-targeted stimuli elicited similar amounts of cytokines from cells of both groups. This TH17 signature correlated with the proportion of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light concentrations. These results suggest that decreases in TH17 cytokines could be an early systemic change in women at risk for developing dementia. Amelioration of TH17s cytokines in early cognitive impairment could, in part, explain the compromised ability of older adults to respond to vaccines or defend against infection.",

At baseline, local activity, as quantified by fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, differentiated between normal and abnormal CSF groups in the NbM but not EC. Further, NbM activity linearly decreased as a function of CSF ratio, resembling the disease status. Finally, NbM activity predicted the annual percentage signal change in EC, but not the reverse, independent from CSF ratio.

        "AbstractText": "Degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, few mouse models of AD recapitulate the neurodegeneration of the cholinergic system. The p75 neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, has been associated with the degeneration of BFCNs in AD. The senescence-accelerated mouse prone number 8 (SAMP8) is a well-accepted model of accelerated and pathological aging. To gain a better understanding of the role of p75NTR in the basal forebrain during aging, we generated a new mouse line, the SAMP8-p75exonIII-/-. Deletion of p75NTR in the SAMP8 background induces an increase in the number of BFCNs at birth, followed by a rapid decline during aging compared to the C57/BL6 background. This decrease in the number of BFCNs correlates with a worsening in the Y-maze memory test at 6\u2009months in the SAMP8-p75exonIII-/-. We found that SAMP8-p75exonIII-/- and C57/BL6-p75exonIII-/- mice expressed constitutively a short isoform of p75NTR that correlates with an upregulation of the protein levels of SREBP2 and its targets, HMGCR and LDLR, in the BF of both SAMP8-p75exonIII-/- and C57/BL6-p75exonIII-/- mice. As the neurodegeneration of the cholinergic system and the dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism are implicated in AD, we postulate that the generated SAMP8-p75exonIII-/- mouse strain might constitute a good model to study long-term cholinergic neurodegeneration in the CNS. In addition, our results support the role of p75NTR signaling in cholesterol biosynthesis regulation.",

Since the neuronal cytoskeleton is a common downstream pathological target of tau and A\u03b2, which mostly lead to augmented microtubule instability, the administration of microtubule stabilizing agents (MSAs) can protect against their pathological actions. However, the effectiveness of MSAs is still uncertain due to their state-dependent negative effects; thus, evaluating their specific actions in different pathological or physiological conditions is required. We evaluated whether epothilone-D (Epo-D), a clinically used MSA, rescues from the functional and behavioral alterations produced by intracerebroventricular injection of A\u03b2, the presence of P-tau, or their combination in rTg4510 mice. We also explored the side effects of Epo-D. To do so, we evaluated hippocampal-dependent spatial memory with the Hebb-Williams maze, hippocampal CA1 integrity and the intrinsic and synaptic properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons with the patch-clamp technique. A\u03b2 and P-tau mildly impaired memory retrieval, but produced contrasting effects on intrinsic excitability. When A\u03b2 and P-tau were combined, the alterations in excitability and spatial reversal learning (i.e., cognitive flexibility) were exacerbated. Interestingly, Epo-D prevented most of the impairments induced A\u03b2 and P-tau alone and combined. However, Epo-D also exhibited some side effects depending on the prevailing pathological or physiological condition, which should be considered in future preclinical and translational studies. Although we did not perform extensive histopathological evaluations or measured microtubule stability, our findings show that MSAs can rescue the consequences of AD-like conditions but otherwise be harmful if administered at a prodromal stage of the disease.",

The potential targets of bioactive compounds were collected using target fishing. Epilepsy and comorbid dementia genes were collected from DISGENET. A PPI network among these targets was constructed using the intersecting key targets between herb targets and disease targets. Besides, DAVID bioinformatics resource was utilized for the pathway enrichment analysis on GO and KEGG. Ultimately, phytochemical compound-target genes-Pathways network has been assembled utilizing Cytoscape to decipher the mechanism of the herb.

        "ArticleTitle": "BAG3 regulates the specificity of the recognition of specific MAPT species by NBR1 and SQSTM1.",
        "AbstractText": "Macroautophagy/autophagy receptors are essential for the recognition and clearance of specific cargos by selective autophagy, which is essential for maintaining MAPT proteostasis. Previous studies have implicated different autophagy receptors in directing distinct species of MAPT to autophagy, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully investigated. Here we examine how the autophagy receptors NBR1 and SQSTM1 differentially associate with specific forms of MAPT. In primary neurons depletion of NBR1, unlike depletion of SQSTM1, significantly increased phosphorylated MAPT levels. The specificity of the interactions was confirmed using in vitro binding assays with purified proteins. We provide direct evidence that the co-chaperone BAG3 promotes the preferential association of NBR1 with monomeric MAPT and SQSTM1 with oligomeric MAPT. Using an in vitro affinity-isolation assay, we show that SQSTM1 only binds to monomeric MAPT when BAG3 is absent and fails to bind when BAG3 is present. The opposite is true of NBR1; its association with monomeric MAPT was dependent on the presence of BAG3. Interestingly, in Alzheimer disease brain the association of NBR1 with BAG3 was significantly decreased. In a mouse model, ablation of BAG3 in neural cells disrupted the association of NBR1 with phosphorylated MAPT and led to increased levels of phosphorylated and oligomeric MAPT. Overall, our results uncover a novel role for BAG3 in regulating the specificity of selective autophagy receptors in targeting different species of MAPT and provide compelling evidence that BAG3 plays a key role in maintaining MAPT proteostasis.",

        "AbstractText": "Multiple-cause-of-death data have not yet been applied to the study of racial/ethnic differences in causal chains of events leading to death, nor they have been used to examine racial/ethnic disparities in cause-of-death certification. We use publicly available 2019 US death certificate data to reassemble chains of morbid events leading to death. From them, we construct and analyze directed multiple cause of death networks by race and sex of deaths aged 60+. Three perspectives to measure disparities are employed: (i) relative prevalence of cause-of-death-pairs, (ii) strength of associations between diseases, (iii) similarities in transition matrices. Non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) had overall lower prevalence of cause of death pairs, Hispanics (HIS) were burdened more by alcohol-related mortality and Asian and Pacific Islanders (API) exceeded in transitions to cerebrovascular diseases. Lower similarity was observed in transitions to external causes of death, dementia and Alzheimer's disease, pulmonary heart diseases, interstitial respiratory diseases, and diseases of the liver. After excluding rare diseases, the similarity further decreased for ill-defined conditions, diabetes mellitus, other cardiovascular diseases, diseases of the pleura, and anemia. To sum up, races/ethnicities not only vary in structure and timing of death but they differ in morbid processes leading to death as well.",

Disruption of adult neurogenesis impairs cognitive function and is correlated with numerous neurologic disorders. Deciphering the mechanism underlying adult neurogenesis not only advances our understanding of how brain functions, but also offers new insight of neurologic diseases and potentially contributes to the development of effective treatments. The field of adult neurogenesis is experiencing significant growth in China.

        "ArticleTitle": "Immunity impacts cognitive deficits across neurological disorders.",
        "AbstractText": "Cognitive deficits are a common comorbidity with neurological disorders and normal aging. Inflammation is associated with multiple diseases including classical neurodegenerative dementias such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS), in which over half of all patients experience some form of cognitive deficits. Other degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) including frontotemporal lobe dementia (FTLD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and psychological disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD), and even normal aging all have cytokine-associated reductions in cognitive function. Thus, there is likely commonality between these secondary cognitive deficits and inflammation. Neurological disorders are increasingly associated with substantial neuroinflammation, in which CNS-resident cells secrete cytokines and chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 and interleukins (ILs) including IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. CNS-resident cells also respond to a wide variety of cytokines and chemokines, which can have both direct effects on neurons by changing the expression of ion channels and perturbing electrical properties, as well as indirect effects through glia-glia and immune-glia cross-talk. There is significant overlap in these cytokine and chemokine expression profiles across diseases, with TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 strongly associated with cognitive deficits in multiple disorders. Here, we review the involvement of various cytokines and chemokines in AD, MS, FTLD, PD, TBI, MDD, and normal aging in the absence of dementia. We propose that the neuropsychiatric phenotypes observed in these disorders may be at least partially attributable to a dysregulation of immunity resulting in pathological cytokine and chemokine expression from both CNS-resident and non-resident cells.",

        "AbstractText": "Cortical iron deposition has recently been shown to occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we aimed to evaluate how cortical gray matter iron, measured using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), differs in the clinical cognitive impairment spectrum. This retrospective study evaluated 73 participants (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 66.7 \u00b1 7.6 years; 52 females and 21 males) with normal cognition (NC), 158 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 48 patients with AD dementia. The participants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging using a three-dimensional multi-dynamic multi-echo sequence on a 3-T scanner. We employed a deep neural network (QSMnet+) and used automatic segmentation software based on FreeSurfer v6.0 to extract anatomical labels and volumes of interest in the cortex. We used analysis of covariance to investigate the differences in susceptibility among the clinical diagnostic groups in each brain region. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to study the association between susceptibility values and cognitive scores including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Among the three groups, the frontal (P < 0.001), temporal (P = 0.004), parietal (P = 0.001), occipital (P < 0.001), and cingulate cortices (P < 0.001) showed a higher mean susceptibility in patients with MCI and AD than in NC subjects. In the combined MCI and AD group, the mean susceptibility in the cingulate cortex (\u03b2 = -216.21, P = 0.019) and insular cortex (\u03b2 = -276.65, P = 0.001) were significant independent predictors of MMSE scores after correcting for age, sex, education, regional volume, and APOE4 carrier status. Iron deposition in the cortex, as measured by QSMnet+, was higher in patients with AD and MCI than in NC participants. Iron deposition in the cingulate and insular cortices may be an early imaging marker of cognitive impairment related neurodegeneration.",

        "AbstractText": "The over-activation of adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR) is closely implicated in cognitive impairments of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Growing evidence shows that A2AR blockade possesses neuroprotective effects on AD. Spatial navigation impairment is an early manifestation of cognitive deficits in AD. However, whether A2AR blockade can prevent early impairments in spatial cognitive function and the underlying mechanism is still unclear. A transgenic APP/PS1 mouse model of AD amyloidosis was used in this study. Behavioral tests were conducted to observe the protective effects of A2AR blockade on early spatial memory deficits in 4-month old APP/PS1 mice. To investigate the underlying synaptic mechanism of the protective effects of A2AR blockade, we further examined long-term potentiation (LTP) and network excitation/inhibition balance of dentate gyrus (DG) region, which is relevant to unique synaptic functions of immature adult-born granule cells (abGCs). Subsequently, the protective effects of A2AR blockade on dendritic morphology and synaptic plasticity of 6-week-old abGCs was investigated using retrovirus infection and electrophysiological recordings. The molecular mechanisms underlying neuroprotective properties of A2AR blockade on the synaptic plasticity of abGCs were further explored using molecular biology methods. APP/PS1 mice displayed DG-dependent spatial memory deficits at an early stage. Additionally, impaired LTP and an imbalance in network excitation/inhibition were observed in the DG region of APP/PS1 mice, indicating synaptic structural and functional abnormalities of abGCs. A2AR was found to be upregulated in the hippocampus of the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. Treatment with the selective A2AR antagonist SCH58261 for three weeks significantly ameliorated spatial memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice and markedly restored LTP and network excitation/inhibition balance in the DG region. Moreover, SCH58261 treatment restored dendritic morphology complexity and enhanced synaptic plasticity of abGCs in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, SCH58261 treatment alleviated the impairment of synaptic plasticity in abGCs. It achieved this by remodeling the subunit composition of NMDA receptors and increasing the proportion of NR2B receptors in abGCs of APP/PS1 mice. Blockade of A2AR improves early spatial memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice, possibly by reversing synaptic defects of abGCs. This finding suggests that A2AR blockade could be a potential therapy for AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Various diseases, including Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, have been reported to be linked to amyloid. Therefore, it is crucial to distinguish amyloid from non-amyloid proteins or peptides. While experimental approaches are typically preferred, they are costly and time-consuming. In this study, we have developed a machine learning framework called iAMY-RECMFF to discriminate amyloidgenic from non-amyloidgenic peptides. In our model, we first encoded the peptide sequences using the residue pairwise energy content matrix. We then utilized Pearson's correlation coefficient and distance correlation to extract useful information from this matrix. Additionally, we employed an improved similarity network fusion algorithm to integrate features from different perspectives. The Fisher approach was adopted to select the optimal feature subset. Finally, the selected features were inputted into a support vector machine for identifying amyloidgenic peptides. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the identification of amyloidgenic peptides compared to existing predictors. This suggests that our method may serve as a powerful tool in identifying amyloidgenic peptides.

        "AbstractText": "Exposure to plastic nanoparticles has dramatically increased in the last 50 years, and there is evidence that plastic nanoparticles can be absorbed by organisms and cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). However, their toxic effects, especially on the nervous system, have not yet been extensively investigated, and most of the knowledge is based on studies using different conditions and systems, thus hard to compare. In this work, physicochemical properties of non-modified polystyrene (PS) and amine-functionalized PS (PS-NH2 ) nanoparticles are initially characterized. Advantage of a multisystemic approach is then taken to compare plastic nanoparticles effects in vitro, through cytotoxic readouts in mammalian cell culture, and in vivo, through behavioral readouts in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a powerful 3R-complying model organism for toxicology studies. In vitro experiments in neuroblastoma cells indicate a specific cytotoxic effect of PS-NH2 particles, including a decreased neuronal differentiation and an increased Amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) secretion, a sensitive readout correlating with Alzheimer's disease pathology. In parallel, only in vivo treatments with PS-NH2 particles affect C. elegans development, decrease lifespan, and reveal higher sensitivity of animals expressing human A\u03b2 compared to wild-type animals. In summary, the multisystemic approach discloses a neurotoxic effect induced by aminated polystyrene nanoparticles.",

In the multivariable-adjusted Cox models, stroke was most strongly associated with dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-1.8). CVD was more strongly associated with VD than with AD. Individuals with HF and MI had an increased risk of AD (HF: HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04-1.19; MI: HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18).

This population-based study engaged 1,446 rural-dwelling older adults (age \u226560 years, 61.0% women) derived from MIND-China; of these, 402 were defined with MCI and 142 with AD. Plasma amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), total tau (t-tau), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) concentrations were analyzed using the Simoa platform. Data were analyzed using linear and logistic regression models, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Across the AD clinical spectrum, plasma A\u03b240 and NfL increased, whereas A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio decreased. Plasma t-tau was higher in people with AD dementia than those with MCI or normal cognition. Plasma NfL outperformed other biomarkers in differentiating AD from normal cognition (area under the ROC curve [AUC]\u200a=\u200a0.75), but all plasma biomarkers performed poorly to distinguish MCI from normal cognition (AUC <0.60). Plasma NfL in combination with age, sex, education, and APOE genotype yielded the AUC of 0.87 for differentiating between AD and normal cognition, 0.79 between AD and MCI, and 0.64 between MCI and normal cognition.

Dysregulation of Fyn kinase has been implicated in various complex diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, as well as different cancer types. Therefore, identifying small molecule inhibitors that can inhibit Fyn activity holds substantial significance in drug discovery. The aim of this study was to identify potential small-molecule inhibitors among bioactive phytoconstituents against tyrosine-protein kinase Fyn. Through a comprehensive approach involving molecular docking, drug likeliness filters, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we performed a virtual screening of a natural compounds library. This methodology aimed to pinpoint compounds potentially interacting with Fyn kinase and inhibiting its activity. This study finds two potential natural compounds: Dehydromillettone and Tanshinone B.

Their conformations exhibitedcompatibility and stability, indicating the formation of robust protein-ligand complexes. A significant array of non-covalentinteractions supported the structural integrity of these complexes. Dehydromillettone and Tanshinone B emerge as promising candidates, poised for further optimization as Fynkinase inhibitors with therapeutic applications.

Sarcopenia was defined according to diagnostic algorithm recommended by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People. Components of sarcopenia were grip strength, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and gait speed. They were further aggregated into a score (0-3 points) by counting the numbers of limited components. Multi-nominal logistic regression was applied. Probable sarcopenia (i.e., reduced grip strength) was observed in 9.6% of the patients, and 3.5% were diagnosed with sarcopenia. Patients with faster gait speed showed less likelihood of MCI (odds ratio [OR]: 0.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.06-0.90) and AD (OR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03-0.60).

The accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques is a histopathological hallmark of AD and associated with increased astrocyte reactivity. In APP/PS1 mice modelling established AD (9 months), we now show an altered astrocytic morphology and enhanced activity of astrocytic hemichannels, mainly composed by connexin 43 (Cx43). Hemichannel activity in hippocampal astrocytes is also increased in two models of early AD: (1) mice with intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of A\u03b21-42, and (2) hippocampal slices superfused with A\u03b21-42 peptides. In hippocampal gliosomes of APP/PS1 mice, Cx43 levels were increased, whereas mice administered icv with A\u03b21-42 only displayed increased Cx43 phosphorylation levels. This suggests that hemichannel activity might be differentially modulated throughout AD progression. Additionally, we tested if adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) blockade reversed alterations of astrocytic hemichannel activity and found that the pharmacological blockade or genetic silencing (global and astrocytic) of A2AR prevented A\u03b2-induced hemichannel dysregulation in hippocampal slices, although A2AR genetic silencing increased the activity of astroglial hemichannels in control conditions. In primary cultures of astrocytes, A2AR-related protective effect was shown to occur through a protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. Our results indicate that the dysfunction of hemichannel activity in hippocampal astrocytes is an early event in AD, which is modulated by A2AR.",

        "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative disease (ND) incidence has recently increased due to improved life expectancy. Alzheimer's (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most prevalent NDs. Both diseases are poly genetic, multifactorial and heterogenous. Preventive medicine, a healthy diet, exercise, and controlling comorbidities may delay the onset. After the diseases are diagnosed, therapy is needed to slow progression. Recent studies show that local, peripheral and age-related inflammation accelerates NDs' onset and progression. Patients with autoimmune disorders like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) could be at higher risk of developing AD or PD. However, no increase in ND incidence has been reported if the patients are adequately diagnosed and treated. Autoantibodies against abnormal tau, \u03b2 amyloid and \u03b1- synuclein have been encountered in AD and PD and may be protective. This discovery led to the proposal of immune-based therapies for AD and PD involving monoclonal antibodies, immunization/ vaccines, pro-inflammatory cytokine inhibition and anti-inflammatory cytokine addition. All the different approaches have been analysed here. Future perspectives on new therapeutic strategies for both disorders are concisely examined.",

        "AbstractText": "Synapse loss is an early event that precedes neuronal death and symptom onset and is considered the best neuropathological correlate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP-2) has emerged as a promising biomarker of AD-related synapse degeneration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The aim of this study was to explore the CSF profile of VAMP-2 across the AD continuum in relation to core AD biomarkers, other synaptic proteins, neurogranin (Ng) and synaptosomal-associated Protein-25\u00a0kDa (SNAP-25) and cognitive performance. We developed a digital immunoassay on the Single Molecule Array platform to quantify VAMP-2 in CSF and used existing immunoassays to quantify Ng, SNAP-25 and core CSF AD biomarkers. The clinical study included 62 cognitively unimpaired AD biomarker-negative subjects and 152 participants across the AD continuum from the SPIN cohort (Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration). Cognitive measures of episodic, semantic, executive and visuospatial domains and global cognition were included. Statistical methods included \u03c72 tests, spearman correlation, and ANCOVA analyses. The VAMP-2 assay had a good analytical performance (repeatability 8.9%, intermediate precision 10.3%). Assay antibodies detected native VAMP-2 protein in human brain homogenates. CSF concentrations of VAMP-2, neurogranin and SNAP-25 were lower in preclinical AD stage 1 compared to controls and higher at later AD stages compared to AD stage 1 and were associated with core AD biomarkers, particularly total tau (adj. r2\u2009=\u20090.62 to 0.78, p\u2009<\u20090.001). All three synaptic proteins were associated with all cognitive domains in individuals on the AD continuum (adj. r2\u2009=\u20090.04 to 0.19, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Our novel digital immunoassay accurately measures VAMP-2 changes in CSF, which reflect AD biomarkers and cognitive performance across multiple domains.",

Clinical diagnoses were made according to latest diagnostic criteria by the attending clinicians. CSF Amyloid Beta1-42 (A\u03b21-42, A), phosphorliated tau 181 (pTau181, T) and total tau (tTau, N) biomarkers were considered normal (-) or abnormal (\u2009+) according to cutoffs of each center.

        "AbstractText": "The metabolic syndrome (MetS) and Alzheimer's disease share several pathological features, including insulin resistance, abnormal protein processing, mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated inflammation and oxidative stress. The MetS constitutes elevated fasting glucose, obesity, dyslipidaemia and hypertension and increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, but the precise mechanism remains elusive. Insulin resistance, which develops from a diet rich in sugars and saturated fatty acids, such as palmitate, is shared by the MetS and Alzheimer's disease. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are also a point of convergence, with altered dynamics in both the MetS and Alzheimer's disease. However, the role of palmitate- and glucose-induced insulin resistance in the brain and its potential link through EVs to Alzheimer's disease is unknown. We demonstrate that palmitate and high glucose induce insulin resistance and amyloid precursor protein phosphorylation in primary rat embryonic cortical neurons and human cortical stem cells. Palmitate also triggers insulin resistance in oligodendrocytes, the supportive glia of the brain. Palmitate and glucose enhance amyloid precursor protein secretion from cortical neurons via EVs, which induce tau phosphorylation when added to na\u00efve neurons. Additionally, EVs from palmitate-treated oligodendrocytes enhance insulin resistance in recipient neurons. Overall, our findings suggest a novel theory underlying the increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in MetS mediated by EVs, which spread Alzheimer's pathology and insulin resistance.",

        "AbstractText": "The main role of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is the transfer of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. There is a long history of investigations regarding the inhibition of CETP as a target for reducing major adverse cardiovascular events. Initially, the potential effect on cardiovascular events of CETP inhibitors was hypothesized to be mediated by their ability to increase HDL cholesterol, but, based on evidence from anacetrapib and the newest CETP inhibitor, obicetrapib, it is now understood to be primarily due to reducing LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. Nevertheless, evidence is also mounting that other roles of HDL, including its promotion of cholesterol efflux, as well as its apolipoprotein composition and anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-diabetic properties, may play important roles in several diseases beyond cardiovascular disease, including, but not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and sepsis. Furthermore, although Mendelian randomization analyses suggested that higher HDL cholesterol is associated with increased risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), excess risk of AMD was absent in all CETP inhibitor randomized controlled trial data comprising over 70,000 patients. In fact, certain HDL subclasses may, in contrast, be beneficial for treating the retinal cholesterol accumulation that occurs with AMD. This review describes the latest biological evidence regarding the relationship between HDL and CETP inhibition for Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, sepsis, and AMD.",

        "AbstractText": "Actin cytoskeleton is critical for neuronal shape and function. Drebrin and formins are key regulators of neuronal actin networks. Neuron-specific drebrin A is highly enriched in dendritic spines (postsynaptic terminals) of mature excitatory neurons. Decreased levels of drebrin in dendritic spines is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and other complex disorders, which calls for better understanding of its regulatory functions. Drebrin A was previously shown to inhibit actin nucleation and bundling by the diaphanous formin-2 (mDia2) - an actin nucleator that is involved in the initiation of dendritic spines. Characterization of the molecular binding interface between mDia2 and drebrin is necessary to better understand the functional consequences of this interaction and its biological relevance. Prior work suggested a multi-pronged interface between mDia2 and drebrin, which involves both N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the drebrin molecule. Here we used mass spectrometry analysis, deletion mutagenesis, and an array of synthetic peptides of neuronal drebrin A to map its formin-binding interface. The mDia2-interacting interface on drebrin was narrowed down to three highly conserved 9-16 residue sequences that were used to identify some of the key residues involved in this interaction. Deletion of the C-terminal region of drebrin greatly reduces its binding to mDia2 and the extent of its inhibition of formin-driven actin assembly. Moreover, our experiments with formins from different subfamilies showed that drebrin is a specific rather than general inhibitor of these proteins. This work contributes to a molecular level understanding of the formin-drebrin interaction and will help to unravel its biological significance.",

Recent studies have linked DIP2A to a variety of mechanisms in many types of brain disorders, suggesting that regulation of DIP2A could provide novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for brain disorders.

Accordingly, molecules that mitigate the toxicity of hazardous protein aggregates are of great interest as potential future therapeutics. Here we asked whether a small peptide, composed of five amino acids (5MER peptide) that was derived from the human pro-inflammatory CD44 protein, could protect model nematodes from the toxicity of aggregative proteins that underlie the development of neurodegenerative disorders in humans. We found that the 5MER peptide mitigates the toxicity that stems from both; the AD-causing A\u03b2 peptide and a stretch of poly-glutamine that is accountable for the development of several disorders including HD, while minimally affecting lifespan. This protection was dependent on the activity of aging-regulating transcription factors and associated with enhanced A\u03b2 and polyQ35-YFP aggregation. A transcriptomic analysis unveiled that the peptide modifies signaling pathways, thereby modulating the expression of various genes, including these, which are known as protein homeostasis (proteostasis) regulators such as txt-13 and modifiers of proteasome activity. The knockdown of txt-13 protects worms from proteotoxicity to the same extent as the 5MER peptide, suggesting that the peptide activates the transcellular chaperone signaling to promote proteostasis. Together, our results propose that the 5MER peptide should be considered as a component of future therapeutic cocktails for the treatment of neurodegenerative maladies.",

This comprehensive review explores the production of SCFAs by gut microbiota, their transportation through the gut-brain axis, and the potential mechanisms by which they influence age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Also, the review discusses the importance of dietary fiber sources and the challenges associated with harnessing dietary-derived SCFAs as promoters of neurological health in elderly individuals. Overall, this study suggests that gut microbiota-derived SCFAs and/or dietary fibers hold promise as potential targets and strategies for addressing age-related neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "AbstractText": "The multifactorial nature of some diseases, particularly neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, frequently requires the use of several drugs. These drug cocktails are not without drawbacks in terms of increased adverse effects, drug-drug interactions or low adherence to treatment. The use of pleiotropic drugs, which combine, within a single molecule, several activities directed against distinct therapeutic targets, makes it possible to overcome some of these problems. In addition, these pleiotropic drugs generally lead to the expression of a synergy of effects, sometimes greater than that observed with a combination of drugs. This article will review, through recent examples, the different kinds of pleiotropic drugs being studied or already present on the market of medicines, with a focus on the structural aspect of such drug design.",

        "AbstractText": "Humanity is facing a vast prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases, with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the most dominant, without efficacious drugs, and with only a few therapeutic targets identified. In this scenario, we aim to find molecular entities that modulate imidazoline I2 receptors (I2-IRs) that have been pointed out as relevant targets in AD. In this work, we explored structural modifications of well-established I2-IR ligands, giving access to derivatives with an imidazole-linked heterocycle as a common key feature. We report the synthesis, the affinity in human I2-IRs, the brain penetration capabilities, the in silico ADMET studies, and the three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) studies of this new bunch of I2-IR ligands. Selected compounds showed neuroprotective properties and beneficial effects in an in vitro model of Parkinson's disease, rescued the human dopaminergic cell line SH-SY5Y from death after treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine, and showed crucial anti-inflammatory effects in a cellular model of neuroinflammation. After a preliminary pharmacokinetic study, we explored the action of our representative 2-(benzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)-1H-imidazole LSL33 in a mouse model of AD (5xFAD). Oral administration of LSL33 at 2 mg/Kg for 4 weeks ameliorated 5XFAD cognitive impairment and synaptic plasticity, as well as reduced neuroinflammation markers. In summary, this new I2-IR ligand that promoted beneficial effects in a well-established AD mouse model should be considered a promising therapeutic strategy for neurodegeneration.",

        "AbstractText": "Chronic, low-grade inflammation has been implicated in aging and age-dependent conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, cardiomyopathy, and cancer. One of the age-associated processes underlying chronic inflammation is protein aggregation, which is implicated in neuroinflammation and a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases. We screened a panel of bioactive thiadiazolidinones (TDZDs) from our in-house library for rescue of protein aggregation in human-cell and C. elegans models of neurodegeneration. Among the tested TDZD analogs, PNR886 and PNR962 were most effective, significantly reducing both the number and intensity of Alzheimer-like tau and amyloid aggregates in human cell-culture models of pathogenic aggregation. A C. elegans strain expressing human A\u03b21-42 in muscle, leading to AD-like amyloidopathy, developed fewer and smaller aggregates after PNR886 or PNR962 treatment. Moreover, age-progressive paralysis was reduced 90% by PNR886 and 75% by PNR962, and \"healthspan\" (the median duration of spontaneous motility) was extended 29% and 62%, respectively. These TDZD analogs also extended wild-type C. elegans lifespan by 15-30% (p < 0.001), placing them among the most effective life-extension drugs. Because the lead drug in this family, TDZD-8, inhibits GSK3\u03b2, we used molecular-dynamic tools to assess whether these analogs may also target GSK3\u03b2. In silico modeling predicted that PNR886 or PNR962 would bind to the same allosteric pocket of inactive GSK3\u03b2 as TDZD-8, employing the same pharmacophore but attaching with greater avidity. PNR886 and PNR962 are thus compelling candidate drugs for treatment of tau- and amyloid-associated neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, potentially also reducing all-cause mortality.",

Molecular docking studies were used to explore the interactions of AChE, BuChE, and A\u03b2.

Further studies showed that 4h had proper blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and suitable in vitro metabolic stability. In in vivo study, 4h effectively ameliorated the learning and memory impairment of the scopolamine-induced AD mice model.

        "AbstractText": "JNK3, a member of the MAPK family, plays a pivotal role in mediating cellular responses to stress signals, with its activation implicated in a myriad of inflammatory conditions. While JNK3 holds promise as a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases, there remains a gap in the market for effective JNK3 inhibitors. Despite some pan-JNK inhibitors reaching clinical trials, no JNK-targeted therapies have achieved market approval. To bridge this gap, our study introduces a sophisticated virtual screening approach. We begin with an energy-based screening, subsequently integrating a variety of rescoring techniques. These encompass glide docking scores, MM/GBSA, and artificial scoring mechanisms such as DeepDock and advanced Graph Neural Networks. This virtual screening workflow is designed to evaluate and identify potential small-molecule inhibitors with high binding affinity. We have implemented a virtual screening workflow to identify potential candidate molecules. This process has resulted in the selection of ten molecules. Subsequently, these ten molecules have undergone biological activity evaluation to assess their potential efficacy. Impressively, molecule compound 6 surfaced as the most promising, exhibiting a potent kinase inhibitory activity marked by an IC50 of 130.1 nM and a notable reduction in TNF-\u03b1 release within macrophages. This suggests that compound 6 could potentially serve as an effective inhibitor for the treatment of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. The prospect of further medicinal modifications to optimize compound 6 presents a promising avenue for future research and development in this field. Utilizing binding pose metadynamics coupled with molecular dynamics simulations, we delved into the explicit binding mode of compound 6 to JNK3. Such insights pave the way for refined drug development strategies. Collectively, our results underscore the efficacy of the hybrid virtual screening workflow in the identification of robust JNK3 inhibitors, holding promise for innovative treatments against neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "AbstractText": "Psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders are amongst the most prevalent and debilitating diseases, but current treatments either have low success rates, greatly due to the low permeability of the blood-brain barrier, and/or are connected to severe side effects. Hence, new strategies are extremely important, and here is where liposome-derived nanosystems come in. Niosomes, transfersomes, and ethosomes are nanometric vesicular structures that allow drug encapsulation, protecting them from degradation, and increasing their solubility, permeability, brain targeting, and bioavailability. This review highlighted the great potential of these nanosystems for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression. Studies regarding the encapsulation of synthetic and natural-derived molecules in these systems, for intravenous, oral, transdermal, or intranasal administration, have led to an increased brain bioavailability when compared to conventional pharmaceutical forms. Moreover, the developed formulations proved to have neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects, including brain neurotransmitter level restoration and brain oxidative status improvement, and improved locomotor activity or enhancement of recognition and working memories in animal models.

Its pathologic features include massive neuroinflammation with abnormal deposition of \u03b2-amyloid peptide in the cerebral tissues leading to degeneration of the brain neurons. Adverse effects associated with the traditional drugs used for the treatment of this pathological condition have directed the research efforts towards searching for alternative effective agents with minimal adverse effects. The aim of this study was to elucidate the potential ameliorative effects of dapagliflozin and/or hesperidin on Alzheimer's disease (AD) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection in rats. In a rodent model of AD, the effect of dapagliflozin with or without hesperidin on the biochemical parameters and the behavioral tests as well as the histopathological parameters was determined. Each of dapagliflozin and hesperidin restored the behavioral tests to the reference values, augmented the antioxidant defense mechanisms, ameliorated the neuronal inflammatory responses, combatted the changes in Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4)/High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein signaling and receptors of advanced glycation end products (RAGE) levels, and restored the balance between the apoptotic signals and autophagy in the hippocampal tissues. Additionally, both agents exhibited an outstanding ability to combat LPS-induced perturbations in the histopathological and electron microscopic image of the brain tissues. These favorable effects were significantly encountered in the group treated with dapagliflozin/hesperidin combination when compared versus animals treated with either dapagliflozin or hesperidin. In conclusion, inhibition of the hippocampal HMGB1/TLR4/RAGE signaling, the pro-inflammatory axis, and apoptosis alongside augmentation of the antioxidant defenses and autophagy can be regarded as beneficial effects by which dapagliflozin/hesperidin combination may combat LPS-triggered AD.",

In a side-by-side comparison, we report the age-dependent development of cognitive, motor, and behavioral deficits in comparison with the spatial-temporal evolution of cellular tau pathology in both models. We applied the SHIRPA primary screen and specific neuromotor, behavioral, and cognitive paradigms. The spatiotemporal development of tau pathology was investigated immunohistochemically. Levels of sarkosyl-insoluble paired helical filaments were determined via a MesoScale Discovery biomarker assay. Neuromotor impairments developed from age 3 months in both models. On electron microscopy, spinal cord neurofibrillary pathology was visible in mice aged 3 months; however, AT8 immunoreactivity was not yet observed in Tau58/4 mice. Behavioral abnormalities and memory deficits occurred at a later stage (>9 months) when tau pathology was fully disseminated throughout the brain. Spatiotemporally, tau pathology spread from the spinal cord via the midbrain to the frontal cortex, while the hippocampus was relatively spared, thus explaining the late onset of cognitive deficits. Our findings indicate the face and construct validity of both Tau58 models, which may provide new, valuable insights into the pathologic effects of tau species in vivo and may consequently facilitate the development of new therapeutic targets to delay or halt neurodegenerative processes occurring in tauopathies.",

The discovery of new potential drugs among monoterpene derivatives is a progressive avenue within experimental pharmacology, offering a promising approach for the therapy of diverse pathological conditions.

        "AbstractText": "The human brain is composed of nearly one hundred billion neurons and an equal number of glial cells, including macroglia, i.e., astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain. In the last few decades, compelling evidence has revealed that glial cells are far more active and complex than previously thought. In particular, astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell population, not only take part in brain development, metabolism, and defense against pathogens and insults, but they also affect sensory, motor, and cognitive functions by constantly modulating synaptic activity. Not surprisingly, astrocytes are actively involved in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and other neurological disorders like brain tumors, in which they rapidly become reactive and mediate neuroinflammation. Reactive astrocytes acquire or lose specific functions that differently modulate disease progression and symptoms, including cognitive impairments. Astrocytes express several types of ion channels, including K+, Na+, and Ca2+ channels, transient receptor potential channels (TRP), aquaporins, mechanoreceptors, and anion channels, whose properties and functions are only partially understood, particularly in small processes that contact synapses. In addition, astrocytes express ionotropic receptors for several neurotransmitters. Here, we provide an extensive and up-to-date review of the roles of ion channels and ionotropic receptors in astrocyte physiology and pathology. As examples of two different brain pathologies, we focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most diffuse neurodegenerative disorders, and glioblastoma (GBM), the most common brain tumor. Understanding how ion channels and ionotropic receptors in astrocytes participate in NDs and tumors is necessary for developing new therapeutic tools for these increasingly common neurological conditions.",

A pathogenic role for Pg by disrupting placental homeostasis was proposed in the association between periodontal disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes. On the basis that trophoblast-derived factors modulate endothelial and immune cell profiles in normal pregnancy and the scarce presence of Pg in placenta, we hypothesized that OMVs from Pg affect trophoblast cell phenotype, impairing trophoblast-endothelium and trophoblast-neutrophil interactions. By means of in vitro designs with first-trimester human trophoblast cells, endothelial cells, and freshly isolated neutrophils, we showed that Pg OMVs are internalized by trophoblast cells and modulate the activity and expression of functional markers. Trophoblast cells primed with Pg OMVs enhanced neutrophil chemoattraction and lost their anti-inflammatory effect. In addition, reduced migration with enhanced adhesion of monocytes was found in endothelial cells upon incubation with the media from trophoblast cells pretreated with Pg OMVs. Taken together, the results support a pathogenic role of Pg OMVs at early stages of pregnancy and placentation through disruption of trophoblast contribution to vascular transformation and immune homeostasis maintenance.",

        "AbstractText": "The monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4; Slc16a3) is expressed in the central nervous system, notably by astrocytes. It is implicated in lactate release and the regulation of glycolytic flux. Whether its expression varies during normal and/or pathological aging is unclear. As the presence of its mature transcript in the brain of young and old mice was determined, an unexpectedly longer RT-PCR fragment was detected in the mouse frontal cortex and hippocampus at 12 vs. 3 months of age. Cultured astrocytes expressed the expected 516 base pair (bp) fragment but treatment with IL-1\u03b2 to mimic inflammation as can occur during aging led to the additional expression of a 928 bp fragment like that seen in aged mice. In contrast, cultured pericytes (a component of the blood-brain barrier) only exhibited the 516 bp fragment. Intriguingly, cultured endothelial cells constitutively expressed both fragments. When RT-PCR was performed on brain subregions of an Alzheimer mouse model (APPswePS1dE9), no fragment was detected at 3 months, while only the 928 bp fragment was present at 12 months. Sequencing of MCT4 RT-PCR products revealed the presence of a remaining intron between exon 2 and 3, giving rise to the longer fragment detected by RT-PCR. These results unravel the existence of intron retention for the MCT4 gene in the central nervous system. Such alternative splicing appears to increase with age in the brain and might be prominent in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Hence, further studies in vitro and in vivo of intron 2 retention in the Slc16a3 gene transcript are required for adequate characterization concerning the biological roles of Slc16a3 isoforms in the context of aging and Alzheimer's disease pathology.",

Over 60% of these individuals live in low- and middle-income countries and are the worst affected, especially by its deleterious effects on the productivity of both patients and caregivers. Numerous risk factors for the disease have been identified and our understanding of gene-environment interactions have shed light on several gene variants that contribute to the most common, sporadic form of AD. Microglial cells, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), have long been established as guardians of the brain by providing neuroprotection and maintaining cellular homeostasis. A protein with a myriad of effects on various important signaling pathways that is expressed in microglia is the Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing Inositol 5' Phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) protein. Encoded by the INPP5D (Inositol Polyphosphate-5-Phosphatase D) gene, SHIP1 has diminutive effects on most microglia signaling processes. Polymorphisms of the INPP5D gene have been found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of AD. Several studies have elucidated mechanistic processes by which SHIP1 exerts its perturbations on signaling processes in peripheral immune cells. However, current knowledge of the controllers of INPP5D/SHIP1 expression and the idiosyncrasies of its influences on signaling processes in microglia and their relevance to AD pathophysiology is limited. In this review, we summarize these discoveries and discuss the potential of leveraging INPP5D/SHIP1 as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.",

We conducted a univariate exome-wide association study and pair-wise pleiotropic analysis focused on AD and 16 cardiovascular traits-6 diseases and 10 cardio-metabolic risk factors-for 188,260 UK biobank participants. Our analysis pinpointed nine genetic markers in the APOE gene region and four loci mapped to the CDK11, OBP2B, TPM1, and SMARCA4 genes, which demonstrated associations with AD at p \u2264 5 \u00d7 10-4 and pleiotropic associations at p \u2264 5 \u00d7 10-8. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, we grouped the phenotypes from these pleiotropic associations into seven clusters. Lipids were divided into three clusters: low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. This split might differentiate the lipid-related mechanisms of AD. The clustering of body mass index (BMI) with weight but not height indicates that weight defines BMI-AD pleiotropy. The remaining two clusters included (i) coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction; and (ii) hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), systolic and diastolic blood pressure. We found that all AD protective alleles were associated with larger weight and higher DM risk. Three of the four (75%) clusters of traits, which were significantly correlated with AD, demonstrated antagonistic genetic heterogeneity, characterized by different directions of the genetic associations and trait correlations.

The patient started to present memory decline and behavioral dysfunction in his early 60s. His brain imaging presented amyloid deposits by positron emission tomography (PET-CT). The multimer detection system (MDS) screening test for plasma for amyloid oligomers was also positive, which supported the AD diagnosis. It was verified that PSEN1 Glu318Gly itself may not impact amyloid production. However, additional variants were found in other AD and non-AD risk genes, as follows: SORL1 Glu270Lys was suggested as a risk mutation for AD and could increase amyloid peptide production and impair endosome functions. ABCA7 Val1946Met was a novel variant that was predicted to be damaging. The GRN Ala505Gly was a variant with uncertain significance; however, it may reduce the granulin levels in the plasma of dementia patients. Pathway analysis revealed that PSEN1 Glu318Gly may work as a risk factor along with the SORL1 and ABCA7 variants since pathway analysis revealed that PSEN1 could directly interact with them through amyloid-related and lipid metabolism pathways. TOMM40 and PSEN1 could have common mechanisms through mitochondrial dysfunction. It may be possible that PSEN1 Glu318Gly and GRN Ala505Gly would impact disease by impairing immune-related pathways, including microglia and astrocyte development, or NFkB-related pathways.

It is commonly used to alleviate central nervous system (CNS) disorders, although its mechanism in Alzheimer's disease is still unknown. This study was designed to predict and validate the underlying mechanism in AD treatment, thus illustrating the biological mechanisms of GT in treating AD. In this study, a PPI network was constructed, KEGG analysis and GO analysis were performed, and an \"active ingredient-target-pathway\" network for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease was constructed. The active ingredients of GT were screened out, and the key targets were performed by molecular docking. UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS was used to screen the main active ingredients and was compared with the network pharmacology results, which verified that GT did contain the above ingredients. A total of targets were found to be significantly bound up with tau, A\u03b2, or A\u03b2 and tau through the network pharmacology study. Three SH-SY5Y cell models induced by okadaic acid (OA), Na2S2O4, and H2O2 were established for in vitro validation. We first found that GT can reverse the increase in the hyperphosphorylation of tau induced by OA to some extent, protecting against ROS damage. Moreover, the results also indicated that GT has significant neuroprotective effects. This study provides a basis for studying the potential mechanisms of GT in the treatment of AD.",

        "AbstractText": "The tumor microbiome, a relatively new research field, affects tumor progression through several mechanisms. The Cancer Microbiome Atlas (TCMA) database was recently published. In the present study, we used TCMA and The Cancer Genome Atlas and examined microbiome profiling in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the role of the intratumoral microbiota in the prognosis of HNSCC patients, and differentially expressed genes in tumor cells in relation to specific bacterial infections. We investigated 18 microbes at the genus level that differed between solid normal tissue (n = 22) and primary tumors (n = 154). The tissue microbiome profiles of Actinomyces, Fusobacterium, and Rothia at the genus level differed between the solid normal tissue and primary tumors of HNSCC patients. When the prognosis of groups with rates over and under the median for each microbe at the genus level was examined, rates for Leptotrichia which were over the median correlated with significantly higher overall survival rates. We then extracted 35 differentially expressed genes between the over- and under-the-median-for-Leptotrichia groups based on the criteria of >1.5 fold and p < 0.05 in the Mann-Whitney U-test. A pathway analysis showed that these Leptotrichia-related genes were associated with the pathways of Alzheimer disease, neurodegeneration-multiple diseases, prion disease, MAPK signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling, while protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that these genes formed a dense network. In conclusion, probiotics and specific antimicrobial therapy targeting Leptotrichia may have an impact on the prognosis of HNSCC.",

        "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide. Neurodegenerative diseases result from progressive damage to nerve cells in the brain or peripheral nervous system connections that are essential for cognition, coordination, strength, sensation, and mobility. Dysfunction of these brain and nerve functions is associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and motor neuron disease. In addition to these, 50% of people living with HIV develop a spectrum of cognitive, motor, and/or mood problems collectively referred to as HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) despite the widespread use of a combination of antiretroviral therapies. Neuroinflammation and neurotransmitter systems have a pathological correlation and play a critical role in developing neurodegenerative diseases. Each of these diseases has a unique pattern of dysregulation of the neurotransmitter system, which has been attributed to different forms of cell-specific neuronal loss. In this review, we will focus on a discussion of the regulation of dopaminergic and cholinergic systems, which are more commonly disturbed in neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, we will provide evidence for the hypothesis that disturbances in neurotransmission contribute to the neuronal loss observed in neurodegenerative disorders. Further, we will highlight the critical role of dopamine as a mediator of neuronal injury and loss in the context of NeuroHIV. This review will highlight the need to further investigate neurotransmission systems for their role in the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "AbstractText": "In individuals with Alzheimer's disease, the brain exhibits elevated levels of IL-1\u03b2 and oxygenated cholesterol molecules (oxysterols). This study aimed to investigate the effects of side-chain oxysterols on IL-1\u03b2 expression using HMC3 microglial cells and ApoE-deficient mice. Treatment of HMC3 cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHChol) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHChol) led to increased IL-1\u03b2 expression at the transcript and protein levels. Additionally, these oxysterols upregulated the surface expression of MHC II, a marker of activated microglia. Immunohistochemistry performed on the mice showed increased microglial expression of IL-1\u03b2 and MHC II when fed a high-cholesterol diet. However, cholesterol and 24s-hydroxycholesterol did not increase IL-1\u03b2 transcript levels or MHC II expression. The extent of IL-1\u03b2 increase induced by 25OHChol and 27OHChol was comparable to that caused by oligomeric \u03b2-amyloid, and the IL-1\u03b2 expression induced by the oxysterols was not impaired by polymyxin B, which inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-1\u03b2 expression. Both oxysterols enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, and Src, and inhibition of these kinase pathways with pharmacological inhibitors suppressed the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and MHC II. The pharmacological agents chlorpromazine and cyclosporin A also impaired the oxysterol-induced expression of IL-1\u03b2 and upregulation of MHC II. Overall, these findings suggest that dysregulated cholesterol metabolism leading to elevated levels of side-chain oxysterols, such as 25OHChol and 27OHChol, can activate microglia to secrete IL-1\u03b2 through a mechanism amenable to pharmacologic intervention. The activation of microglia and subsequent neuroinflammation elicited by the immune oxysterols can contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases.",

While immunotherapeutic interventions have provided much-awaited solutions, nucleic acid-based tools represent other avenues of intervention; however, these approaches are costly and invasive, and they have serious side effects. Previously, we have shown in AD animal models that tolfenamic acid (TA) can lower the expression of AD-related genes and their products and subsequently reduce pathological burden and improve cognition. Using TA as a scaffold and the zinc finger domain of SP1 as a pharmacophore, we developed safer and more potent brain-penetrating analogs that interfere with sequence-specific DNA binding at transcription start sites and predominantly modulate the expression of SP1 target genes. More importantly, the proteome of treated cells displayed ~75% of the downregulated products as SP1 targets. Specific levels of SP1-driven genes and AD biomarkers such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Tau proteins were also decreased as part of this targeted systemic response. These small molecules, therefore, offer a viable alternative to achieving desired therapeutic outcomes by interfering with both amyloid and Tau pathways with limited off-target systemic changes.",

A seed-to-voxel analysis was conducted to measure the LC and SN rsFC differences between sexes. In addition, sex by A\u03b2 interactive effects on FC values were analyzed with a general linear model. There were statistically significant sex by regional standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) interactions in the LC FC with the parietal, frontal, and occipital cortices.

The 5XFAD mouse model is commonly used in AD research because it expresses five human transgenes that result in the accumulation of A\u03b2 plaques and cognitive decline at a relatively early age. Behavioral experiments are frequently conducted using this model; however, the effect size has not yet been reported. In this study, we examined basic cognition and locomotion in 5XFAD mice with a C57BL6/J background (5XFAD-J) at 6 months of age, a period in which impairments of cognitive function and locomotion are commonly observed. We analyzed the effect sizes of cognitive and locomotive experiments in the 5XFAD mice compared with those in the wild-type mice. Our results suggest that for long-term memory analysis, the novel object recognition test (p = 0.013, effect size 1.24) required a sample size of at least 12 to obtain meaningful results. Moreover, analysis of general locomotion over total distance with the Laboratory Animal Behavior Observation, Registration and Analysis System (LABORAS) test during the dark phase (p = 0.007, effect size -1.37) needed a sample size of 10 for a statistical power (1-\u03b2) of 0.8.

The EOs were obtained through hydro-distillation of dried leaves and subsequently analyzed using GC/MS. The main class of compounds was constituted by oxygenated monoterpenes, particularly prominent in E. brevifolia (75.7%), E. lehmannii (72.8%), and E. woollsiana (67%). Anti-enzymatic activities against cholinesterases, \u03b1-amylase, and \u03b1-glucosidase were evaluated using spectrophotometric methods. Notably, the E. brevifolia, E. extensa, E. leptophylla, E. patellaris, and E. woollsiana EOs displayed potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition (IC50: 0.25-0.60 mg/mL), with E. lehmannii exhibiting lower activity (IC50: 1.2 mg/mL). E. leptophylla and E. brevifolia showed remarkable \u03b1-amylase inhibition (IC50: 0.88 mg/mL), while E. brevifolia and E. leptophylla significantly hindered \u03b1-glucosidase (IC50 < 30 mg/mL), distinguishing them from other EOs with limited effects. Additionally, the EOs were assessed for their anti-biofilm properties of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes) and Gram-negative (Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) bacterial strains. The E. extensa EO demonstrated the main antibiofilm effect against E. coli and L. monocytogenes with an inhibition > 80% at 10 mg/mL. These findings could represent a basis for possible further use of Eucalyptus EOs in the treatment of human microbial infections and/or as a coadjutant in preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease and/or diabetes mellitus.",

A\u03b2(25-35) is the shortest peptide that retains the toxicity of A\u03b2(1-42). A\u03b2 oligomers bind to calmodulin (CaM) and calbindin-D28k with dissociation constants in the nanomolar A\u03b2(1-42) concentration range. A\u03b2 and histidine-rich proteins have a high affinity for transition metal ions Cu2+, Fe3+ and Zn2+. In this work, we show that the fluorescence of A\u03b2(1-42) HiLyteTM-Fluor555 can be used to monitor hexa-histidine peptide (His6) interaction with A\u03b2(1-42). The formation of His6/A\u03b2(1-42) complexes is also supported by docking results yielded by the MDockPeP Server. Also, we found that micromolar concentrations of His6 block the increase in the fluorescence of A\u03b2(1-42) HiLyteTM-Fluor555 produced by its interaction with the proteins CaM and calbindin-D28k. In addition, we found that the His6-tag provides a high-affinity site for the binding of A\u03b2(1-42) and A\u03b2(25-35) peptides to the human recombinant cytochrome b5 reductase, and sensitizes this enzyme to inhibition by these peptides.

Results: Results showed that AD patients exhibited poorer performance in switching in both VF tasks and SVF clustering compared to NC. Similarly, the aMCI group performed worse than the NC in switching and clustering in both tasks, with aMCI performing similarly to AD, except for SVF switching. In contrast, the naMCI subgroup performed similarly to those with NC across most strategies, surpassing AD patients. Notably, the aMCI subgroup's poor performance in SVF switching was mainly due to the subpar performance of the multi-domain aMCI subgroup. This subgroup was outperformed in switching in both VF tasks by the single-domain naMCI, who also performed better than the multi-domain naMCI in SVF switching. No significant differences emerged in terms of perseverations and intrusions. Conclusions: Overall, these findings suggest a continuum of declining switching ability in the SVF task, with NC surpassing both aMCI and AD, and aMCI outperforming those with AD. The challenges in SVF switching suggest executive function impairment associated with multi-domain MCI, particularly driven by the multi-domain aMCI.",

        "AbstractText": "Background and Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as a pervasive neurodegenerative ailment of global concern, necessitating a relentless pursuit of remedies. This study aims to furnish a comprehensive exposition, delving into the intricate mechanistic actions of medicinal herbs and phytochemicals. Furthermore, we assess the potential of these compounds in inhibiting human acetylcholinesterase through molecular docking, presenting encouraging avenues for AD therapeutics. Materials and Methods: Our approach entailed a systematic exploration of phytochemicals like curcumin, gedunin, quercetin, resveratrol, nobiletin, fisetin, and berberine, targeting their capability as human acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, leveraging the PubChem database. Diverse bioinformatics techniques were harnessed to scrutinize molecular docking, ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity), and adherence to Lipinski's rule of five. Results: Results notably underscored the substantial binding affinities of all ligands with specific amino acid residues within AChE. Remarkably, gedunin exhibited a superior binding affinity (-8.7 kcal/mol) compared to the reference standard. Conclusions: These outcomes accentuate the potential of these seven compounds as viable candidates for oral medication in AD treatment. Notably, both resveratrol and berberine demonstrated the capacity to traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB), signaling their aptitude for central nervous system targeting. Consequently, these seven molecules are considered orally druggable, potentially surpassing the efficacy of the conventional drug, donepezil, in managing neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "AbstractText": "Lewy body dementia (LBD) is an often misdiagnosed and mistreated neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by the emergence of neuropsychiatric symptoms followed by motor impairment. LBD falls within an undefined range between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) due to the potential pathogenic synergistic effects of tau, beta-amyloid (A\u03b2), and alpha-synuclein (\u03b1syn). A lack of reliable and relevant animal models hinders the elucidation of the molecular characteristics and phenotypic consequences of these interactions. Here, the goal was to evaluate whether the viral-mediated overexpression of \u03b1syn in adult hTau and APP/PS1 mice or the overexpression of tau in Line 61 hThy1-\u03b1syn mice resulted in pathology and behavior resembling LBD. The transgenes were injected intravenously via the tail vein using AAV-PHP.eB in 3-month-old hThy1-\u03b1syn, hTau, or APP/PS1 mice that were then aged to 6-, 9-, and 12-months-old for subsequent phenotypic and histological characterization. Although we achieved the widespread expression of \u03b1syn in hTau and tau in hThy1-\u03b1syn mice, no \u03b1syn pathology in hTau mice and only mild tau pathology in hThy1-\u03b1syn mice was observed. Additionally, cognitive, motor, and limbic behavior phenotypes were not affected by overexpression of the transgenes. Furthermore, our APP/PS1 mice experienced premature deaths starting at 3 months post-injection (MPI), therefore precluding further analyses at later time points. An evaluation of the remaining 3-MPI indicated no \u03b1syn pathology or cognitive and motor behavioral changes. Taken together, we conclude that the overexpression of \u03b1syn in hTau and APP/PS1 mice and tau in hThy1-\u03b1syn mice does not recapitulate the behavioral and neuropathological phenotypes observed in LBD.",

Because obtaining facial images is much easier than obtaining brain images, the aim of this work was to investigate whether AD exhibits accelerated aging patterns in facial asymmetry. We developed new facial asymmetry measures to compare Alzheimer's patients with healthy controls. A three-dimensional camera was used to capture facial images, and 68 facial landmarks were identified using an open-source machine-learning algorithm called OpenFace. A standard image registration method was used to align the three-dimensional original and mirrored facial images. This study used the registration error, representing landmark superimposition asymmetry distances, to examine 29 pairs of landmarks to characterize facial asymmetry. After comparing the facial images of 150 patients with AD with those of 150 age- and sex-matched non-demented controls, we found that the asymmetry of 20 landmarks was significantly different in AD than in the controls (p < 0.05). The AD-linked asymmetry was concentrated in the face edge, eyebrows, eyes, nostrils, and mouth. Facial asymmetry evaluation may thus serve as a tool for the detection of AD.",

This strongly argues for an overlap in pathogenic mechanisms. The commonly researched immune targets include various immune cell subsets, such as microglia, peripheral macrophages, and regulatory T cells (Tregs); the complement system; and other soluble factors. In this review, we compare these neurodegenerative diseases from a clinical point of view and highlight common pathways and mechanisms of protein aggregation, neurodegeneration, and/or neuroinflammation that could potentially lead to shared treatment strategies for overlapping immune dysfunctions in these diseases. These approaches include but are not limited to immunisation, complement cascade blockade, microbiome regulation, inhibition of signal transduction, Treg boosting, and stem cell transplantation.",

The main etiology of AD is senile dementia, which is linked to amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) deregulation and tau perivascular pathogeny. Hyperphosphorylated tau has a propensity for microtubules, which elevate the instability and tau-protein congregates, leading to accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Tau hyperphosphorylation is susceptible to GSK-3, which has led to an emerging hypothesis regarding the pathogenesis of AD. Accordingly, attempts have been made to conduct investigations and achieve further advancements on new analogues capable of inhibiting the GSK-3 protein, which are currently in the clinical trials. In this analysis, we have evaluated certain GSK-3 inhibitor variants utilising scaffolding and framework devised techniques with pharmacological characteristics, accompanied by computational screenings (pharmacokinetics and docking). The structure-based designed analogues interacted effectively with the active amino acids of GSK-3\u03b2 target protein. The in silico pharmacokinetic studies revealed their drug-like properties. The analogues with best interactions and binding scores will be considered in the future to completely demonstrate their potential relevance as viable GSK-3 inhibitors.",

One of the most relevant and prevalent SVDs is cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), whose pathological hallmark is the deposition of amyloid fragments in the walls of small cortical and leptomeningeal vessels. CAA frequently coexists with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and both are associated with cerebrovascular events, cognitive impairment, and dementia. CAA and AD share pathophysiological, histopathological and neuroimaging issues. The venular involvement in both diseases has been neglected, although both animal models and human histopathological studies found a deposition of amyloid beta in cortical venules. This review aimed to summarize the available information about venular involvement in CAA, starting from the biological level with the putative pathomechanisms of cerebral damage, passing through the definition of the peculiar angioarchitecture of the human cortex with the functional organization and consequences of cortical arteriolar and venular occlusion, and ending to the hypothesized links between cortical venular involvement and the main neuroimaging markers of the disease.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early and accurate prediction of AD progression is crucial for early intervention and personalized treatment planning. Although AD does not yet have a reliable therapy, several medications help slow down the disease's progression. However, more study is still needed to develop reliable methods for detecting AD and its phases. In the recent past, biomarkers associated with AD have been identified using neuroimaging methods. To uncover biomarkers, deep learning techniques have quickly emerged as a crucial methodology. A functional molecular imaging technique known as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) has been shown to be effective in assisting researchers in understanding the morphological and neurological alterations to the brain associated with AD. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have also long dominated the field of AD progression and have been the subject of substantial research, while more recent approaches like vision transformers (ViT) have not yet been fully investigated. In this paper, we present a self-supervised learning (SSL) method to automatically acquire meaningful AD characteristics using the ViT architecture by pretraining the feature extractor using the self-distillation with no labels (DINO) and extreme learning machine (ELM) as classifier models. In this work, we examined a technique for predicting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD utilizing an SSL model which learns powerful representations from unlabeled 18F-FDG PET images, thus reducing the need for large-labeled datasets. In comparison to several earlier approaches, our strategy showed state-of-the-art classification performance in terms of accuracy (92.31%), specificity (90.21%), and sensitivity (95.50%). Then, to make the suggested model easier to understand, we highlighted the brain regions that significantly influence the prediction of MCI development. Our methods offer a precise and efficient strategy for predicting the transition from MCI to AD. In conclusion, this research presents a novel Explainable SSL-ViT model that can accurately predict AD progress based on 18F-FDG PET scans. SSL, attention, and ELM mechanisms are integrated into the model to make it more predictive and interpretable. Future research will enable the development of viable treatments for neurodegenerative disorders by combining brain areas contributing to projection with observed anatomical traits.",

        "AbstractText": "Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an important task that facilitates the development of treatment and prevention strategies, and may potentially improve patient outcomes. Neuroimaging has shown great promise, including the amyloid-PET, which measures the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain-a hallmark of AD. It is desirable to train end-to-end deep learning models to predict the progression of AD for individuals at early stages based on 3D amyloid-PET. However, commonly used models are trained in a fully supervised learning manner, and they are inevitably biased toward the given label information. To this end, we propose a selfsupervised contrastive learning method to accurately predict the conversion to AD for individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with 3D amyloid-PET. The proposed method, SMoCo, uses both labeled and unlabeled data to capture general semantic representations underlying the images. As the downstream task is given as classification of converters vs. non-converters, unlike the general self-supervised learning problem that aims to generate task-agnostic representations, SMoCo additionally utilizes the label information in the pre-training. To demonstrate the performance of our method, we conducted experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. The results confirmed that the proposed method is capable of providing appropriate data representations, resulting in accurate classification. SMoCo showed the best classification performance over the existing methods, with AUROC = 85.17%, accuracy = 81.09%, sensitivity = 77.39%, and specificity = 82.17%. While SSL has demonstrated great success in other application domains of computer vision, this study provided the initial investigation of using a proposed self-supervised contrastive learning model, SMoCo, to effectively predict MCI conversion to AD based on 3D amyloid-PET.",

A total of 300,327 subjects aged \u2265 45 years with a history of cataract diagnosis but no previous diagnosis of dementia were analyzed. The relationship between cataract surgery and dementia was evaluated, applying a time-varying analysis to evaluate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) values according to dementia. It was calculated via a multivariable Cox regression model, with adjustments for age, sex, visual acuity (VA), ocular and systemic comorbidities, and social factors (including body mass index, income, smoking, and drinking). In the multivariate analysis, the cataract surgery group showed a marginal difference in dementia development (HR 1.10 [95% CI 1.02-1.19]) because both cataract and dementia share common risk factors. However, in the subgroup analysis, men (HR 0.49 [95% CI 0.26-0.90]) and patients under 65 years of age (HR 0.88 [95% CI 0.79-0.99]) in the group with cataract surgery and good VA showed a significantly lower incidence of dementia.

However, the results were still controversial. The association between cholesterol levels and incident dementia in older women is not fully understood either. We conducted a retrospective analysis on a cohort of non-demented women aged older than 50 years, which was registered in the History-based Artificial Intelligence Clinical Dementia Diagnostic System database from September 2015 to August 2021. We followed this cohort longitudinally to examine the rates of conversion to dementia. Using a Cox regression model, we investigated the impact of the quartile of total cholesterol (TC) levels on incident dementia, adjusting for age, sex, education, neuropsychiatric symptoms, neuropsychological assessments, HRT, as well as various vascular risk factors and medications. We examined a cohort of 787 participants, comprising 539 (68.5%) individuals who did not develop dementia (non-converters). Among these non-converters, 68 individuals (12.6%) were treated with HRT. By contrast, there were 248 (31.5%) who did develop dementia (converters). Among the converters, 28 individuals (11.3%) were treated with HRT. The average follow-up durations were 2.9 \u00b1 1.5 and 3.3 \u00b1 1.6 years for non-converters and converters, respectively. Compared to the lowest quartile of TC levels (<153), the hazard ratios (HR) for converting to dementia were 0.61, 0.58, and 0.58 for the second (153-176), third (177-201), and highest (>201) quartiles, respectively (all p < 0.05). However, the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level and HRT did not alter the rate of conversion to dementia. In conclusion, the lowest quartile of TC increased incident dementia in post-menopausal women without dementia; however, HRT did not contribute to conversion to dementia. Some studies suggest that post-menopausal women who have reduced estrogen levels might have an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease if they also have high cholesterol. Nonetheless, the evidence is inconclusive, as not all studies support this finding.

Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) develop over a preclinical period of many years beginning in midlife. The prevalence of insulin resistance, a prominent risk factor for late-life dementia, also accelerates in middle-age. Consumption of berry fruits, including strawberries, has been shown to influence metabolism as well as cognitive performance suggesting potential to mitigate risk for dementia. In this controlled trial, we enrolled overweight middle-aged men and women with insulin resistance and subjective cognitive decline and performed a 12-week intervention with daily administration of whole-fruit strawberry powder. Diet records showed that participants in both groups maintained the prescribed abstinence from berry product consumption outside the study. We observed diminished memory interference (p = 0.02; Cohen's f = 0.45) and a reduction of depressive symptoms (p = 0.04; Cohen's f = 0.39) for the strawberry-treated participants; benefits consistent with improved executive ability. However, there was no effect of the intervention on metabolic measures, possibly a consequence of the sample size, length of the intervention, or comparatively low anthocyanin dose. Anti-inflammatory actions of anthocyanins were considered as a primary mechanistic factor. The findings support the notion that strawberry supplementation has a role in dementia risk reduction when introduced in midlife. However, further investigation with longer intervention periods, larger samples, and differing dosing regimens will be required to assess the benefits of strawberry intake with respect to cognition and metabolic function in the context of aging.",

Out of 5627 articles, 73 studies were assessed for full-text eligibility, which led to the inclusion of 42 studies (26 PD and 16 AD studies). The risk of bias assessment showed a medium risk in 32 studies (20 PD studies and 12 AD studies), a low risk in 9 studies (5 PD studies and 4 AD studies), and 1 PD study with a high risk.

An essential feature of COPD is pulmonary inflammation, which results from long-term exposure to noxious substances from cigarette smoking and other environmental pollutants. Pulmonary inflammatory mediators spill over to the blood, leading to systemic inflammation, which is believed to play a significant role in the onset of a host of comorbidities associated with COPD. A substantial comorbidity of concern in COPD patients that is often overlooked in COPD management is cognitive impairment. The exact pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in COPD patients remains a mystery; however, hypoxia, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and cerebral manifestations of these conditions are believed to play crucial roles. Furthermore, the use of medications to treat cognitive impairment symptomatology in COPD patients has been reported to be associated with life-threatening adverse effects, hence the need for alternative medications with reduced side effects. In this Review, we aim to discuss the impact of cognitive impairment in COPD management and the potential mechanisms associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment in COPD patients. The promising roles of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (\u03c9-3 PUFAs) in improving cognitive deficits in COPD patients are also discussed. Interestingly, \u03c9-3 PUFAs can potentially enhance the cognitive impairment symptomatology associated with COPD because they can modulate inflammatory processes, activate the antioxidant defence system, and promote amyloid-beta clearance from the brain. Thus, clinical studies are crucial to assess the efficacy of \u03c9-3 PUFAs in managing cognitive impairment in COPD patients.",

A molecular docking study exhibited that the compounds occupied the key residues of acetylcholinesterase with \u0394G range between -6.91 and -9.49 kcal/mol, where MDIE has \u2206G: -8.67 kcal/mol, which was better than that of tacrine, \u2206G: -8.25 kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics analyses of 100 ns supported the stability of the protein-ligand complexes analyzed through RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and SASA parameters. TRP_84 and GLY_442 are the most critical hydrophobic contacts for the complex, although GLU_199 is important for H-bonds. Prime/MM-GBSA showed that the protein-ligand complex formed a stable confirmation. These findings suggest that the aqueous extract of Khudari fruit pulp has significant antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase inhibition potentials, and its compound, MDIE, forms stably with confirmation with the target protein, though this fruit of Khudari dates can be a better functional food for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Further investigations are needed to fully understand the therapeutic role of this plant-based compound via in vivo study.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive dysfunctions, is associated with high levels of amyloid beta 42 (A\u03b242), which is believed to play a role in cellular damage and signaling changes in AD. Decanoic acid has been shown to be therapeutic in AD. Glutamatergic signaling within neurons and astrocytes of the CA1 region of the hippocampus is critical in cognitive processes, and previous work has indicated deficiencies in this signaling in a mouse model of AD. In this study, we investigated glutamate-mediated signaling by evaluating AMPA-mediated calcium rises in female and male CA1 neurons and astrocytes in a mouse model of AD and examined the potential of decanoic acid to normalize this signaling. In brain slices from 5xFAD mice in which there are five mutations leading to increasing levels of A\u03b242, AMPA-mediated calcium transients in CA1 neurons and astrocytes were significantly lower than that seen in wildtype controls in both females and males. Interestingly, incubation of 5xFAD slices in decanoic acid restored AMPA-mediated calcium levels in neurons and astrocytes in both females and males to levels indistinguishable from those seen in wildtype, whereas similar exposure to decanoic acid did not result in changes in AMPA-mediated transients in neurons or astrocytes in either sex in the wildtype. Our data indicate that one mechanism by which decanoic acid could improve cognitive functioning is through normalizing AMPA-mediated signaling in CA1 hippocampal cells.",

With respect to the psychotropic effects and dependence potential of THC (though it is very mild), its use is associated with certain restrictions, and thus the therapeutic properties of CBD are frequently emphasized because there are no limitations associated with the risk of dependence. Therefore, this review covers the main pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic features of CBD (including characteristics of endocannabinoidome) with respect to its possible beneficial effects on selected diseases in clinical practice.

Some of the most common NDs include Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's Disease (HD). There are currently no available cures; there are only therapeutic approaches that ameliorate the progression of symptoms, which makes the search for new drugs and therapeutic targets a constant battle. Cyanobacteria are ancient prokaryotic oxygenic phototrophs whose long evolutionary history has resulted in the production of a plethora of biomedically relevant compounds with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties, that can be valuable in this field. This review summarizes the major NDs and their pathophysiology, with a focus on the anti-neurodegenerative properties of cyanobacterial compounds and their main effects.",

        "AbstractText": "Oxidative stress is a deteriorating condition that arises due to an imbalance between the reactive oxygen species and the antioxidant system or defense of the body. The key reasons for the development of such conditions are malfunctioning of various cell organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi complex, as well as physical and mental disturbances. The nervous system has a relatively high utilization of oxygen, thus making it particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress, which eventually leads to neuronal atrophy and death. This advances the development of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration-associated disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, dementia, and other memory disorders. It is imperative to treat such conditions as early as possible before they worsen and progress to irreversible damage. Oxidative damage can be negated by two mechanisms: improving the cellular defense system or providing exogenous antioxidants. Natural antioxidants can normally handle such oxidative stress, but they have limited efficacy. The valuable features of nanoparticles and/or nanomaterials, in combination with antioxidant features, offer innovative nanotheranostic tools as potential therapeutic modalities. Hence, this review aims to represent novel therapeutic approaches like utilizing nanoparticles with antioxidant properties and nanotheranostics as delivery systems for potential therapeutic applications in various neuroinflammation- and neurodegeneration-associated disease conditions.",

Although numerous therapeutic agents with promising potential have been developed, none have successfully treated AD to date. Consequently, the pursuit of novel methodologies to address neurodegenerative processes in AD remains a paramount endeavor. A particularly promising avenue in this search is optogenetics, enabling the manipulation of neuronal activity. In recent years, research attention has pivoted from neurons to glial cells. This review aims to consider the potential of the optogenetic correction of astrocyte metabolism as a promising strategy for correcting AD-related disorders. The initial segment of the review centers on the role of astrocytes in the genesis of neurodegeneration. Astrocytes have been implicated in several pathological processes associated with AD, encompassing the clearance of \u03b2-amyloid, neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and lipid metabolism (along with a critical role in apolipoprotein E function). The effect of astrocyte-neuronal interactions will also be scrutinized. Furthermore, the review delves into a number of studies indicating that changes in cellular calcium (Ca2+) signaling are one of the causes of neurodegeneration. The review's latter section presents insights into the application of various optogenetic tools to manipulate astrocytic function as a means to counteract neurodegenerative changes.",

Although by itself it has very few applications, its derivatives have diverse biological activities. In this work, 8536 quinoline derivatives, strategically designed using the CADMA-Chem protocol, are presented. This large chemical space was sampled, analyzed and reduced using selection and elimination scores that combine their properties of bioavailability, toxicity and manufacturability. After applying several filters, 25 derivatives were selected to investigate their acid-base, antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. The antioxidant activity was predicted based on the ionization potential and bond dissociation energies, parameters directly related to the transfer of hydrogen atoms and of a single electron, respectively. These two mechanisms are typically involved in the radical scavenging processes. The antioxidant efficiency was compared with reference compounds, and the most promising antioxidants were found to be more efficient than Trolox but less efficient than ascorbate. In addition, based on molecular docking simulations, some derivatives are expected to act as inhibitors of catechol-O methyltransferase (COMT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) enzymes. Some structural insights about the compounds were found to enhance or decrease the neuroprotection activity. Based on the results, four quinoline derivatives are proposed as candidates to act as multifunctional antioxidants against Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases.",

While oxidative processes have been robustly implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases, the significance of particular antioxidants, both endogenous and especially exogenous, in maintaining redox homeostasis requires further research. Among endogenous antioxidants, enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase are central to disabling free radicals, thereby preventing oxidative damage to cellular lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Whether supplementation with endogenously occurring antioxidant compounds such as melatonin and glutathione carries any benefit, however, remains equivocal. Similarly, while the health benefits of certain exogenous antioxidants, including ascorbic acid (vitamin C), carotenoids, polyphenols, sulforaphanes, and anthocyanins are commonly touted, their clinical efficacy and effectiveness in particular neurological disease contexts need to be more robustly defined. Here, we review the current literature on the cellular mechanisms mitigating oxidative stress and comment on the possible benefit of the most common exogenous antioxidants in diseases such as AD, PD, ALS, HD, stroke, epilepsy, and migraine.

However, the mechanisms of the altered metabolism involved in AD pathology are poorly understood. The aim of the study was to identify the potential biomarkers of AD and discover the metabolomic changes produced during the progression of the disease. (2) Methods: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to measure the concentrations of the serum metabolites in a cohort of subjects with AD (n = 88) and a cognitively normal control (CN) group (n = 85). The patients were classified as very mild (n = 25), mild (n = 27), moderate (n = 25), and severe (n = 11). The serum metabolic profiles were analyzed using multivariate and univariate approaches. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was applied to identify the potential biomarkers of AD. Biofunctional enrichment analysis was performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. (3) Results: Our results revealed considerable separation between the AD and CN groups. Six metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers of AD (AUC > 0.85), and the diagnostic model of three metabolites could predict the risk of AD with high accuracy (AUC = 0.984). The metabolic enrichment analysis revealed that carbohydrate metabolism deficiency and the disturbance of amino acid, fatty acid, and lipid metabolism were involved in AD progression. Especially, the pathway analysis highlighted that l-glutamate participated in four crucial nervous system pathways (including the GABAergic synapse, the glutamatergic synapse, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, and the synaptic vesicle cycle). (4) Conclusions: Carbohydrate metabolism deficiency and amino acid dysregulation, fatty acid, and lipid metabolism disorders were pivotal events in AD progression.

        "ArticleTitle": "The Connection between Chronic Liver Damage and Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease: Evidence and Insights from a Rat Model.",
        "AbstractText": "Junk foods are typically low in essential nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. They are also loaded with trans fats and saturated fats, which can increase the level of triglycerides in the blood. High triglyceride levels can contribute to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition where excess fat accumulates in the liver. A high intake of junk foods can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells become less responsive to insulin. A diet lacking in nutrients and loaded with unwanted toxins can impair the liver's ability to detoxify harmful substances and damage its overall function. It is known that the regular consumption of junk food can be linked to memory impairment and cognitive decline. Several studies have shown that diets high in unhealthy fats, sugars, and processed foods can negatively impact brain health, including memory function. In this study, Wistar rats were used to model Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD), which was inspired by knowledge of the liver-brain axis's role in causing dementia. The model mimicked junk-food-induced liver-brain damage, and was developed by using the toxins d-galactosamine, ethanol and d-galactose. To begin with, the model rats demonstrated insulin resistance, a characteristic of LOAD patients. Glucose levels in both the brain and liver tissues were significantly elevated in the model, paralleling clinical findings in LOAD patients. High glucose levels in the brain lead to the increased production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which, along with amyloid beta, harm neighbouring neurons. Histopathological analysis revealed deformed glial nodules, apoptotic neurons, and amyloid plaques in the brain section in the later stages of the disease. Simultaneously, the liver section displayed features of cirrhosis, including an effaced lobular architecture and the extravasation of red blood cells. Liver enzymes ALT, AST and ALP were consistently elevated with disease progression. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the diseased brain. The positive expression of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 3-Alpha (HIF3A) in the brain indicated hypoxic conditions, which is consistent with other LOAD studies. This model also exhibited damaged intestinal villi and excessive bowel and urinary incontinence, indicating malnutrition and a disturbed gut microbiome, which is also consistent with LOAD patients. Bioinformatics analysis on serum protein suggests a few affected molecular pathways, like the amyloid secretase pathway, androgen/oestrogen/progesterone biosynthesis, the apoptosis signalling pathway, the insulin/IGF pathway-protein kinase B signalling cascade, the Metabotropic glutamate receptor group I pathway, the Wnt signalling pathway, etc. Behavioural analysis confirmed memory decline and the loss of muscle strength with disease progression. Overall, this rat model of LOAD sheds valuable light on LOAD pathology and highlights the potential link between liver dysfunction, particularly induced by the excessive consumption of junk food, and LOAD. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms involved in LOAD, paving the way for new possibilities in therapeutic interventions.",

        "AbstractText": "Cerebral ischemia, a leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide, triggers a cascade of molecular and cellular pathologies linked to several central nervous system (CNS) disorders. These disorders primarily encompass ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), epilepsy, and other CNS conditions. Despite substantial progress in understanding and treating the underlying pathological processes in various neurological diseases, there is still a notable absence of effective therapeutic approaches aimed specifically at mitigating the damage caused by these illnesses. Remarkably, ischemia causes severe damage to cells in ischemia-associated CNS diseases. Cerebral ischemia initiates oxygen and glucose deprivation, which subsequently promotes mitochondrial dysfunction, including mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening, mitophagy dysfunction, and excessive mitochondrial fission, triggering various forms of cell death such as autophagy, apoptosis, as well as ferroptosis. Ferroptosis, a novel type of regulated cell death (RCD), is characterized by iron-dependent accumulation of lethal reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation. Mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis both play critical roles in the pathogenic progression of ischemia-associated CNS diseases. In recent years, growing evidence has indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction interplays with ferroptosis to aggravate cerebral ischemia injury. However, the potential connections between mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis in cerebral ischemia have not yet been clarified. Thus, we analyzed the underlying mechanism between mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis in ischemia-associated CNS diseases. We also discovered that GSH depletion and GPX4 inactivation cause lipoxygenase activation and calcium influx following cerebral ischemia injury, resulting in MPTP opening and mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, dysfunction in mitochondrial electron transport and an imbalanced fusion-to-fission ratio can lead to the accumulation of ROS and iron overload, which further contribute to the occurrence of ferroptosis. This creates a vicious cycle that continuously worsens cerebral ischemia injury. In this study, our focus is on exploring the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis, which may offer new insights into potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment of ischemia-associated CNS diseases.",

As a biomarker closely related to neuroinflammation, YKL-40 provides a potential scalable approach in AD, but its association remains controversial and inconclusive with AD. We conducted this study to assess the utility of YKL-40 levels in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients and healthy controls (HCs) by meta-analysis. We systematically searched and screened relevant trials for comparing YKL-40 levels between AD patients and HCs in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science, with a search deadline of 14 March 2023 for each database. A total of 17 eligible and relevant studies involving 1811 subjects, including 949 AD patients and 862 HCs, were included. The results showed that YKL-40 levels in the peripheral blood of AD patients and HCs did not possess significant differences. Subgroup analysis showed YKL-40 significantly differed in plasma (SMD = 0.527, 95%CI: [0.302, 0.752]; p = 0.000), but did not in serum. In the case of comparison with HCs, YKL-40 was significantly higher in CSF of AD patients (SMD = 0.893, 95%CI: [0.665, 1.121]; p = 0.000). Besides that, when we performed a combined analysis of total YKL-40 in both peripheral blood and CSF, overall YKL-40 concentrations were also significantly increased among AD patients (SMD = 0.608, 95%CI: [0.272, 0.943]; p = 0.000). YKL-40 provides support and rationale for the neuroinflammatory pathogenesis of AD. The significance of CSF levels of YKL-40 for early screening of AD is definite. Plasma levels of YKL-40 also appear to assist in discriminating AD patients from HCs, which facilitates early screening and monitoring of the natural course of AD.",

Epigenetic studies may help identify molecular signatures of IR associated with AD, thus improving our understanding of the biological and regulatory mechanisms linking IR and AD. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study of IR, quantified using the homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) and adjusted for body mass index, in 3,167 participants from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) without type 2 diabetes at the time of blood draw used for methylation measurement. We identified DNA methylation markers associated with IR at the genome-wide level accounting for multiple testing (P\u2009<\u20091.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7) and evaluated their association with neurological traits in participants from the FHS (N\u2009=\u20093040) and the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP, N\u2009=\u2009707). DNA methylation profiles were measured in blood (FHS) or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (ROSMAP) using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Linear regressions (ROSMAP) or mixed-effects models accounting for familial relatedness (FHS) adjusted for age, sex, cohort, self-reported\u00a0race, batch, and cell type proportions were used to assess associations between DNA methylation and neurological traits accounting for multiple testing.

In FHS, higher levels of blood DNA methylation at cg00574958 and cg17058475 were both associated with lower IR (P\u2009=\u20092.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910-11 and P\u2009=\u20099.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8), larger total brain volumes (P\u2009=\u20090.03 and P\u2009=\u20099.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4), and smaller log lateral ventricular volumes (P\u2009=\u20090.07 and P\u2009=\u20090.03).

Using detergent-insoluble tau isolated from Alzheimer's disease (AD-tau) or Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP-tau) patients, we provide insights into whether phosphorylation of critical residues determine templated tau seeding. Our initial data with phosphorylation-ablating mutations (Ser/Thr\u2009\u2192\u2009Ala) on select sites of P301L tau showed no changes in seeding efficacy by AD-tau or PSP-tau. Interestingly, when specific sites in the R1-R2 repeat domains (Ser262/Thr263/Ser289/Ser305) were mutated to phosphorylation-mimicking amino acid Glu, it substantially reduced the seeding efficiency of AD-tau, but not PSP-tau seeds. The resultant detergent-insoluble tau shows deficient phosphorylation on AT8, AT100, AT180 and PHF1 epitopes, indicating inter-domain cooperativity. We further identify Ser305 as a critical determinant of AD-tau-specific seeding, whereby the phospho-mimicking Ser305Glu tau abrogates seeding by AD-tau but not PSP-tau. This suggests that phosphorylation on Ser305 could be related to the formation of disease-specific tau strains.

The irreversible neurodegeneration leads to a gradual loss of brain function characterized predominantly by memory loss. Cerebrovascular changes are common neuropathologic findings in aged subjects with dementia. Cerebrovascular integrity is critical for proper metabolism and perfusion of the brain, as cerebrovascular remodeling may render the brain more susceptible to pulse pressure and may be associated with poorer cognitive performance and greater risk of cerebrovascular events. The objective of this study is to provide understanding of cerebrovascular remodeling with AD progression. Anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs) from a total of 19 brain donor participants from controls and pathologically diagnosed AD groups (early-Braak stages I-II; intermediate-Braak stages III-IV; and advanced-Braak stages V-VI) were included in this study. Mechanical testing, histology, advanced optical imaging, and mass spectrometry were performed to study the progressive structural and functional changes of ACAs with AD progression. Biaxial extension-inflation tests showed that ACAs became progressively less compliant, and the longitudinal stress in the intermediate and advanced AD groups was significantly higher than that from the control group. With pathological AD development, the inner and outer diameters of the\u00a0ACAs remained almost unchanged; however, histology study revealed progressive smooth muscle cell atrophy and loss of elastic fibers which led to compromised structural integrity of the arterial wall. Multiphoton imaging demonstrated elastin degradation at the media-adventitia interface, which led to the formation of an empty band of 21.0\u2009\u00b1\u200915.4\u00a0\u03bcm and 32.8\u2009\u00b1\u20099.24\u00a0\u03bcm in width for the intermediate and advanced AD groups, respectively.

Mass spectrometry analysis provided further evidence of altered collagen content and other extracellular matrix (ECM) molecule and smooth muscle cell changes that were consistent with the mechanical and structural alterations.

AD model mice were administered 6\u00a0\u03bcl of 0.1\u00a0mg/ml PACAP liquid intranasally for 4\u00a0weeks, then subjected to behavioral analyses to assess the benefits of PACAP treatment. The underlying mechanisms of PACAP-induced effects were investigated by methods including real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. Exosomes were extracted from human serum and subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to examine autophagy pathways. The clinical and therapeutic implications of PACAP and autophagy were extensively investigated throughout the experiment. Impaired autophagy was a critical step in amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) and Tau deposition; PACAP enhanced autophagy and attenuated cognitive impairment. RNA sequencing revealed three pathways that may be involved in AD progression: PI3K-AKT, mTOR, and AMPK. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that sirtuin3 knockdown diminished the ability of PACAP to restore normal autophagy function, resulting in phagocytosis dysregulation and the accumulation of pTau, Tau, and A\u03b2. Additionally, the autophagic biomarker MAP1LC3 demonstrated a positive association with PACAP in human serum. PACAP reverses AD-induced cognitive impairment through autophagy, using sirtuin3 as a key mediator. MAP1LC3 has a positive relationship with PACAP in humans. These findings provide insights regarding potential uses of intranasal PACAP and sirtuin3 agonists in AD treatment. NCT04320368.",

        "AbstractText": "Liensinine and neferine are the main bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids obtained from the seeds of Nelumbo nucifera, which commonly used as edible food and traditional medicine in Asia. It was reported that liensinine and neferine could inhibit the activities of acetylcholinesterase and cross the blood-brain barriers, suggesting their therapeutic potential for the management of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we employed SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with the human Swedish amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutation APP695 (APP695swe SH-SY5Y) as an in vitro model and transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans as an in vivo model to investigate the neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanism of liensinine and neferine. We found that liensinine and neferine could significantly improve the viability and reduce ROS levels in APP695swe SH-SY5Y cells, inhibit \u03b2-amyloid and tau-induced toxicity, and enhance stress resistance in nematodes. Moreover, liensinine and neferine had obviously neuroprotective effects by assaying chemotaxis, 5-hydroxytryptamine sensitivity and the integrity of injured neurons in nematodes. Preliminary mechanism studies revealed that liensinine and neferine could upregulate the expression of autophagy related genes (lgg-1, unc-51, pha-4, atg-9 and ced-9) and reduce the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid induced autophagosomes, which suggested autophagy pathway played a key role in neuroprotective effects of these two alkaloids. Altogether, our findings provided a certain working foundation for the use of liensinine and neferine to treat Alzheimer's disease based on neuroprotective effects.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2). It affects cognition and leads to memory impairment. The mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) plays an essential role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and has been implicated in several neuronal disorders or neuronal injuries. Ligands targeting the mitochondrial translocator protein (18\u2009kDa), promote neurosteroidogenesis and may be neuroprotective. To study whether the TSPO ligand XBD173 may exert early neuroprotective effects in AD pathology we investigated the impact of XBD173 on amyloid toxicity and neuroplasticity in mouse models of AD. We show that XBD173 (emapunil), via neurosteroid-mediated signaling and delta subunit-containing GABAA receptors, prevents the neurotoxic effect of A\u03b2 on long-term potentiation (CA1-LTP) in the hippocampus and prevents the loss of spines. Chronic but not acute administration of XBD173 ameliorates spatial learning deficits in transgenic AD mice with arctic mutation (ArcA\u03b2). The heterozygous TSPO-knockout crossed with the transgenic arctic mutation model of AD mice (het TSPOKO X ArcA\u03b2) treated with XBD173 does not show this improvement in spatial learning suggesting TSPO is needed for procognitive effects of XBD173. The neuroprotective profile of XBD173 in AD pathology is further supported by a reduction in plaques and soluble A\u03b2 levels in the cortex, increased synthesis of neurosteroids, rescued spine density, reduction of complement protein C1q deposits, and reduced astrocytic phagocytosis of functional synapses both in the hippocampus and cortex. Our findings suggest that XBD173 may exert therapeutic effects via TSPO in a mouse model of AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease begins with mild memory loss and slowly destroys memory and thinking. Cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease has been associated with the localization of the microtubule-associated protein Tau at the postsynapse. However, the correlation between Tau at the postsynapse and synaptic dysfunction remains unclear. Here, we show that Tau arrests liquid-like droplets formed by the four postsynaptic density proteins PSD-95, GKAP, Shank, Homer in solution, as well as NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)-receptor-associated protein clusters on synthetic membranes. Tau-mediated condensate/cluster arrest critically depends on the binding of multiple interaction motifs of Tau to a canonical GMP-binding pocket in the guanylate kinase domain of PSD-95. We further reveal that competitive binding of a high-affinity phosphorylated peptide to PSD-95 rescues the diffusional dynamics of an NMDA truncated construct, which contains the last five amino acids of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B fused to the C-terminus of the tetrameric GCN4 coiled-coil domain, in postsynaptic density-like condensates/clusters. Taken together, our findings propose a molecular mechanism where Tau modulates the dynamic properties of the postsynaptic density.",

        "AbstractText": "Recent advancements in omics technologies have unveiled a hitherto unknown group of short polypeptides called microproteins (miPs). Despite their size, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that miPs exert varied and potent biological functions. They act in paracrine, juxtracrine, and endocrine fashion, maintaining cellular physiology and driving diseases. The present study focuses on biochemical and biophysical analysis and characterization of twenty-four human miPs using distinct computational methods, including RIDAO, AlphaFold2, D2P2, FuzDrop, STRING, and Emboss Pep wheel. miPs often lack well-defined tertiary structures and may harbor intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that play pivotal roles in cellular functions. Our analyses define the physicochemical properties of an essential subset of miPs, elucidating their structural characteristics and demonstrating their propensity for driving or participating in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and intracellular condensate formation. Notably, miPs such as NoBody and pTUNAR revealed a high propensity for LLPS, implicating their potential involvement in forming membrane-less organelles (MLOs) during intracellular LLPS and condensate formation. The results of our study indicate that miPs have functionally profound implications in cellular compartmentalization and signaling processes essential for regulating normal cellular functions. Taken together, our methodological approach explains and highlights the biological importance of these miPs, providing a deeper understanding of the unusual structural landscape and functionality of these newly defined small proteins. Understanding their functions and biological behavior will aid in developing targeted therapies for diseases that involve miPs.",

        "AbstractText": "Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is a frequently observed underlying pathology of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD), which is a common consequence of cerebral blood flow (CBF) dysregulation. Synaptic damage has been proven as a crucial causative factor for CCH-related cognitive impairment. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective impact of environmental enrichment (EE) intervention on CCH-induced synaptic destruction and the consequent cognitive impairment. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism of this neuroprotective effect was explored to provide new insights into therapeutic interventions for individuals suffering from AD or VD. In this experiment, all rats were initially acclimatized to a standard environment (SE) for a period of one week. On the seventh day, rats underwent either bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO) surgery or sham surgery (Sham) before being subjected to a four-week procedure of exposure to an EE, except for the control group. During the EE or SE procedure, intraperitoneal injection of chloroquine (CQ) into rats was performed once daily for four weeks. Following this, cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) test. The synapse ultrastructure was subsequently observed using transmission electron microscopy. Expression levels of autophagy-related proteins (LC3, LAMP1, and P62) and synapse-related proteins (Synapsin I and PSD-95) were detected through Western blotting. Finally, immunofluorescence was used to examine the expression levels of Synapsin I and PSD-95 and the colocalization of LAMP-1 and LC3 in the hippocampus. After undergoing 2VO, rats exposed to SE exhibited cognitive impairment, autophagic dysfunction, and synapse damage. The synapse damage was evidenced by ultrastructural damage and degradation of synapse-related proteins. However, these effects were significantly mitigated by exposure to an EE intervention. Moreover, the intervention led to an improvement in autophagic dysfunction. The study found that EE had a positive impact on CCH-induced synaptic damage. Specifically, EE was found to increase synaptic plasticity-associated proteins and postsynaptic density thickness, while decreasing synaptic space. This multifaceted effect resulted in an amelioration of CCH-induced cognitive impairment. It was shown that this beneficial outcome was mediated via the activation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. Overall, the findings suggest that EE may have a therapeutic potential for cognitive impairments associated with CCH through autophagy-mediated synaptic improvement.",

        "AbstractText": "The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to rise due to the increasing aging population. Among the various genetic factors associated with AD, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a lipid transporter, stands out as the primary genetic risk factor. Specifically, individuals carrying the ApoE4 allele exhibit a significantly higher risk. However, emerging research indicates that dietary factors play a prominent role in modifying the risk of AD. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a prominent \u03c9-3 fatty acid, has garnered considerable attention for its potential to ameliorate cognitive function. The intricate interplay between DHA and the ApoE genotype within the brain, which may influence DHA's utilization and functionality, warrants further investigation. This review meticulously examines experimental and clinical studies exploring the effects of DHA on cognitive decline. Special emphasis is placed on elucidating the role of ApoE gene polymorphism and the potential underlying mechanisms are discussed. These studies suggest that early DHA supplementation may confer benefits to cognitively normal older adults carrying the ApoE4 gene. However, once AD develops, ApoE4 non-carriers may experience greater benefits compared to ApoE4 carriers, although the overall effectiveness of DHA supplementation at this stage is limited. Potential mechanisms underlying these differential effects may include accelerated DHA catabolism in ApoE4 carriers, impaired transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and compromised lipidization and circulatory function in ApoE4 carriers. Thus, the supplementation of DHA may represent a potential intervention strategy aimed at compensating for these deficiencies in ApoE4 carriers prior to the onset of AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by triplication of human chromosome 21. In addition to intellectual disability, DS is defined by a premature aging phenotype and Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, including septohippocampal circuit vulnerability and degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs). The Ts65Dn mouse model recapitulates key aspects of DS/AD pathology, namely age-associated atrophy of BFCNs and cognitive decline in septohippocampal-dependent behavioral tasks. We investigated whether maternal choline supplementation (MCS), a well-tolerated treatment modality, protects vulnerable BFCNs from age- and genotype-associated degeneration in trisomic offspring. We also examined the impact of trisomy, as well as MCS, on GABAergic basal forebrain parvalbumin neurons (BFPNs), an unexplored neuronal population in this DS model. Unbiased stereological analyses of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-immunoreactive BFCNs and parvalbumin-immunoreactive BFPNs were conducted using confocal z-stacks of the medial septal nucleus and the vertical limb of the diagonal band (MSN/VDB) in Ts65Dn mice and disomic (2\u202fN) littermates at 3-4 and 10-12\u202fmonths of age. MCS trisomic offspring displayed significant increases in ChAT-immunoreactive neuron number and density compared to unsupplemented counterparts, as well as increases in the area of the MSN/VDB occupied by ChAT-immunoreactive neuropil. MCS also rescued BFPN number and density in Ts65Dn offspring, a novel rescue of a non-cholinergic cell population. Furthermore, MCS prevented age-associated loss of BFCNs and MSN/VDB regional area in 2\u202fN offspring, indicating genotype-independent neuroprotective benefits. These findings demonstrate MCS provides neuroprotection of vulnerable BFCNs and non-cholinergic septohippocampal BFPNs, indicating this modality has translational value as an early life therapy for DS, as well as extending benefits to the aging population at large.",

We aimed to develop automated brain health risk scores calculated from data in the electronic health record (EHR) enabling population-wide brain health screening in advance of patient care visits. This retrospective cohort study included patients with visits to an outpatient neurology clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital, between January 2010 and March 2021. Survival analysis with an 11-year follow-up period was performed to predict the risk of intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, depression, death and composite outcome of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and mild cognitive impairment. Variables included age, sex, vital signs, laboratory values, employment status and social covariates pertaining to marital, tobacco and alcohol status. Random sampling was performed to create a training (70%) set for hyperparameter tuning in internal 5-fold cross validation and an external hold-out testing (30%) set of patients, both stratified by age. Risk ratios for high and low risk groups were evaluated in the hold-out test set, using 1000 bootstrapping iterations to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CI). The cohort comprised 17,040 patients with an average age of 49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.6\u00a0years; majority were males (57\u00a0%), White (78\u00a0%) and non-Hispanic (80\u00a0%). The low and high groups average risk ratios [95\u00a0% CI] were: intracranial hemorrhage 0.46 [0.45-0.48] and 2.07 [1.95-2.20], ischemic stroke 0.57 [0.57-0.59] and 1.64 [1.52-1.69], depression 0.68 [0.39-0.74] and 1.29 [0.78-1.38], composite of dementia 0.27 [0.26-0.28] and 3.52 [3.18-3.81] and death 0.24 [0.24-0.24] and 3.96 [3.91-4.00].

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly associated with self-aggregation of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) proteins into fibrils. Inhibition of A\u03b2 aggregation by polyphenols is one of the major therapeutic strategies for AD. Among them, four polyphenols (brazilin, resveratrol, hematoxylin, and rosmarinic acid) have been reported to be effective at inhibiting A\u03b2 aggregation, but the inhibition mechanisms are still unclear. In this work, these four polyphenols were selected to explore their interactions with the A\u03b217-42 pentamer by molecular dynamics simulation. All four polyphenols can bind to the pentamer tightly but prefer different binding sites. Conversion of the \u03b2-sheet to the random coil, fewer interchain hydrogen bonds, and weaker salt bridges were observed after binding. Interestingly, different A\u03b217-42 pentamer destabilizing mechanisms for resveratrol and hematoxylin were found. Resveratrol inserts into the hydrophobic core of the pentamer by forming hydrogen bonds with Asp23 and Lys28, while hematoxylin prefers to bind beside chain A of the pentamer, which leads to \u03b2-sheet offset and dissociation of the \u03b21 sheet of chain E. This work reveals the interactions between the A\u03b217-42 pentamer and four polyphenols and discusses the relationship between inhibitor structures and their inhibition mechanisms, which also provides useful guidance for screening effective A\u03b2 aggregation inhibitors and drug design against AD.",

Recently, studies suggested that R1 obtained from different tracers could be used interchangeably and is irrespective of target tissue. However, the similarities or differences of R1 obtained from different PET tracers still require validation. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to compare R1 estimates, derived from dynamic [18F]florbetapir (amyloid) and [18F]flortaucipir (tau) PET, in the same subjects with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Voxel-wise analysis presented a small cluster (1.6% of the whole brain) with higher R1 values for [18F]flortaucipir compared to [18F]florbetapir in the A\u03b2-negative group. These voxels were part of the hippocampus and the left middle occipital gyrus. In part of the thalamus, midbrain and cerebellum, voxels (2.5% of the whole brain) with higher R1 values for [18F]florbetapir were observed.

Furthermore, in part of the thalamus, left amygdala, midbrain and right parahippocampal gyrus voxels (0.4% of the whole brain) with higher R1 values for [18F]florbetapir were observed.

Data gathered from the Alzheimer's Disease Patient and Caregiver Engagement (AD PACE) What Matters Most (WMM) study series were analyzed to determine how much time care partners spent providing care to PLWAD based on where the care recipients lived. Additionally, quantitative assessments of weekly hours providing care and the strain experienced by care partners were conducted using the UsAgainstAlzheimer's A-LIST Insights Series survey, which included the Modified Caregiver Strain Index (MCSI). Finally, a targeted literature review was conducted to contextualize findings and characterize the existing literature landscape. Care partners in the AD PACE WMM studies (n\u2009=\u2009139) spent significantly more hours providing care for recipients who lived with someone (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation [SD], 57.3\u2009\u00b1\u200944.3\u00a0h/week) than for recipients who lived alone (26.0\u2009\u00b1\u200912.0\u00a0h/week) (P\u2009=\u20090.0096) or lived in assisted living/nursing home (23.6\u2009\u00b1\u200914.4\u00a0h/week) (P\u2009=\u20090.0002). In the A-LIST Insights Series survey, care partners provided an overall mean (\u00b1 SD) 58.1\u2009\u00b1\u200953.0\u00a0h of direct care each week, with caregiving hours increasing with increasing severity of AD/AD-related dementias\u00a0(AD/ADRD). Additionally, care partners for recipients with mild (n\u2009=\u200914), moderate (n\u2009=\u2009111), and severe AD/ADRD (n\u2009=\u200991) had overall mean MCSI scores of 9.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8 (range 2-14), 13.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.8 (range 4-23), and 17.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3 (range 4-26), respectively, with higher scores suggesting greater care partner strain. Persons living with AD require increasing levels of care along the spectrum of disease, and even individuals with early disease need care from partners. Early interventions that slow progression of AD and programs that improve family function may have beneficial impact on the experiences of care partners for recipients with mild, moderate, or severe AD.",

        "AbstractText": "With increasing numbers of older prisoners, effective strategies for preventing and treating age-associated diseases, such as cognitive disorders, are needed. As pharmacological therapies are limited, non-pharmacological interventions are increasingly recognized as potential treatment strategies. One approach is cognitive training (CT). However, no study has investigated CT in the prison setting. Thus, this one-arm feasibility trial aims to analyze the feasibility of (i) the study protocol and (ii) the implementation of multimodal CT for older prisoners. Eighteen older male prisoners from two specific divisions for older prisoner participated in 12 weekly CT sessions using the NEUROvitalis program. The feasibility analysis included recruitment, dropout, and CT participation rates, and motivation for and satisfaction with CT (using 6-point Likert-scales). The study protocol demonstrated sufficient feasibility with high recruitment rates between 46 and 50%. Therefore, the CT implementation was successful: Only one prisoner ceased participation; all others completed the CT sessions (i.e., attended\u2009>\u200975% of the sessions). Prisoners reported high CT motivation and satisfaction, and would recommend CT. This is the first study to demonstrate CT feasibility in older prisoners.

This cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted in Shanghai and Zhengzhou, China. All participants were recruited from urban communities and memory clinics. Amyloid positivity and deposition were analyzed based on amyloid positron emission tomography (PET). We used partial least squares (PLS) models to investigate how related factors contributed to amyloid deposition and cognitive decline. In total, 1026 participants were included: 768 participants from the community-based cohort (COMC) and 258 participants from the clinic-based cohort (CLIC). The overall amyloid-positive rates in individuals with clinically diagnosed AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal cognition (NC) were 85.8%, 44.5%, and 26.9%, respectively.

        "AbstractText": "Multimodal neuroimaging has gained traction in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis by integrating information from multiple imaging modalities to enhance classification accuracy. However, effectively handling heterogeneous data sources and overcoming the challenges posed by multiscale transform methods remains a significant hurdle. This article proposes a novel approach to address these challenges. To harness the power of diverse neuroimaging data, we employ a strategy that leverages optimized convolution techniques. These optimizations include varying kernel sizes and the incorporation of instance normalization, both of which play crucial roles in feature extraction from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images. Specifically, varying kernel sizes allow us to adapt the receptive field to different image characteristics, enhancing the model's ability to capture relevant information. Furthermore, we employ transposed convolution, which increases spatial resolution of feature maps, and it is optimized with varying kernel sizes and instance normalization. This heightened resolution facilitates the alignment and integration of data from disparate MRI and PET data. The use of larger kernels and strides in transposed convolution expands the receptive field, enabling the model to capture essential cross-modal relationships. Instance normalization, applied to each modality during the fusion process, mitigates potential biases stemming from differences in intensity, contrast, or scale between modalities. This enhancement contributes to improved model performance by reducing complexity and ensuring robust fusion. The performance of the proposed fusion method is assessed on three distinct neuroimaging datasets, which include: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), consisting of 50 participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive Normal, AD, and Early Mild Cognitive); Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), consisting of 50 participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive Normal, Mild Dementia, Very Mild Dementia); and whole-brain atlas neuroimaging (AANLIB) (consisting of 50 participants each at various stages of AD for both MRI and PET (Cognitive Normal, AD). To evaluate the quality of the fused images generated via our method, we employ a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, including Structural Similarity Index Measurement (SSIM), which assesses the structural similarity between two images; Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), which measures how closely the generated image resembles the ground truth; Entropy (E), which assesses the amount of information preserved or lost during fusion; the Feature Similarity Indexing Method (FSIM), which assesses the structural and feature similarities between two images; and Edge-Based Similarity (EBS), which measures the similarity of edges between the fused and ground truth images. The obtained fused image is further evaluated using a Mobile Vision Transformer. In the classification of AD vs. Cognitive Normal, the model achieved an accuracy of 99.00%, specificity of 99.00%, and sensitivity of 98.44% on the AANLIB dataset.",

However, the relationship between benzodiazepine use and dementia risk has produced inconsistent results, necessitating an updated review of the evidence. To address this, we conducted an umbrella review of meta-analyses to summarize the available evidence on the association between benzodiazepine use and dementia risk and evaluate its credibility. We systematically evaluated the meta-analyses of observational studies that examined the connection between benzodiazepine use and dementia risk. For each meta-analysis, we collected the overall effect size, heterogeneity, risk of bias, and year of the most recent article and graded the evidence based on pre-specified criteria. We also used AMSTAR, a measurement tool to evaluate systematic reviews, to assess the methodological quality of each study. Our review included five meta-analyses encompassing 30 studies, and the effect size of the association between benzodiazepine use and dementia risk ranged from 1.38 to 1.78. Nonetheless, the evidence supporting this relationship was weak, and the methodological quality of the studies included was low. In conclusion, our findings revealed limited evidence of a link between benzodiazepine use and dementia risk, and more research is required to determine a causal connection.

It was hypothesized that individuals with EOMCI will preserve their cognitive functions to a greater extent as compared to individuals with LOMCI, even after adjusting the cognitive performance for age and education through the use of published Greek norms. The level of cognitive decline concerning MOMCI was evaluated for extracting more precise conclusions regarding the impact of the age of onset on the patterns of MCI symptomatology. The analyses of data were conducted in a Greek population of individuals with MCI, who were consecutive visitors of the Outpatient Memory Clinic of Nestor Alzheimer's Centre in Athens, Greece. The sample consisted of 297 participants who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: MCI diagnosis based on Petersen's criteria, Greek mother language, and absence of a psychiatric history or chronic and incurable organic disease. The overall results support the presence of a cognitive advantage of the EOMCI group compared to the LOMCI group. In the MOMCI group, cognitive performance displayed a tendency to remain intermediate compared to the other two groups. Nonetheless, significant differences were observed when this group was compared with the LOMCI group. The current findings indicate that the age of onset should be taken under consideration in the neuropsychological assessment of individuals with MCI.

Therefore, phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) \u03b13, the most virulent protein secreted by Staphylococcus aureus, has attracted much attention. In this work, the effect of PSM\u03b13 with a unique cross-\u03b1 fibril architecture on the aggregation of pathogenic A\u03b240 of AD was studied by extensive biophysical characterizations. The results proposed that the PSM\u03b13 monomer inhibited the aggregation of A\u03b240 in a concentration-dependent manner and changed the aggregation pathway to form granular aggregates. However, PSM\u03b13 oligomers promoted the generation of the \u03b2-sheet structure, thus shortening the lag phase of A\u03b240 aggregation. Moreover, the higher the cross-\u03b1 content of PSM\u03b13, the stronger the effect of the promotion, indicating that the cross-\u03b1 structure of PSM\u03b13 plays a crucial role in the aggregation of A\u03b240. Further molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have shown that the Met1-Gly20 region in the PSM\u03b13 monomer can be combined with the Asp1-Ala2 and His13-Val36 regions in the A\u03b240 monomer by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, which prevents the conformational conversion of A\u03b240 from the \u03b1-helix to \u03b2-sheet structure. By contrast, PSM\u03b13 oligomers mainly combined with the central hydrophobic core (CHC) and the C-terminal region of the A\u03b240 monomer by weak H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions, which could not inhibit the transition to the \u03b2-sheet structure in the aggregation pathway. Thus, the research has unraveled molecular interactions between A\u03b240 and PSM\u03b13 of different structures and provided a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between bacterial amyloids and AD-related pathogenic A\u03b2.",

The study employed a control-experimental group setup. To ensure randomization, each participant was assigned a unique number, and a random number generator was used for group allocation. A total of 41 eligible participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were included in the study after screening.

In particular, the interplay facilitated by TNTs among various cell types within the brain, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, glial cells, and microglia, can be essential for the normal development and optimal functioning of this complex organ.

During aging, telomere length gradually shortens, producing short telomeres, which are markers of premature cellular senescence. This may contribute to age-related diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and based on this, several studies have hypothesized that telomere shortening may characterize AD. Current research, however, has been inconclusive regarding the direction of the association between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and disease risk. We assessed the association between LTL and AD in a retrospective case-control study of a sample of 255 unrelated patients with late-onset AD (LOAD), including 120 sporadic cases and 135 with positive family history for LOAD, and a group of 279 cognitively healthy unrelated controls, who were all from Calabria, a southern Italian region. Following regression analysis, telomeres were found significantly shorter in LOAD cases than in controls (48% and 41% decrease for sporadic and familial cases, respectively; p < 0.001 for both). Interestingly, LTL was associated with disease risk independently of the presence of conventional risk factors (e.g., age, sex, MMSE scores, and the presence of the APOE-\u03b54 allele).

In this study, we utilized stereotactic delivery of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-DUSP4 to overexpress DUSP4 in the dorsal hippocampus of 5xFAD and wildtype (WT) mice, then used mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics along with label-free quantification to profile the proteome and phosphoproteome in the hippocampus. We identified patterns of protein expression and phosphorylation that are modulated in 5xFAD mice and examined the sex-specific impact of DUSP4 overexpression on the 5xFAD proteome/phosphoproteome. In 5xFAD mice, a substantial number of proteins were up- or down-regulated in both male and female mice in comparison to age and sex-matched WT mice, many of which are involved in AD-related biological processes, such as the activated immune response or suppression of synaptic activities. Upon DUSP4 overexpression, significantly regulated proteins were found in pathways that were suppressed, such as the immune response, in male 5xFAD mice. In contrast, such a shift was absent in female mice. For the phosphoproteome, we detected an array of phosphorylation sites that are regulated in 5xFAD compared to WT, and are modulated by DUSP4 overexpression in each sex. Interestingly, the changes in 5xFAD- and DUSP4-associated phosphorylation occurred in opposite directions. Strikingly, both the 5xFAD- and DUSP4-associated phosphorylation changes were found for the most part in neurons, and play key roles in neuronal processes and synaptic function. Site-centric pathway analysis revealed that both the 5xFAD- and DUSP4-associated phosphorylation sites were enriched for a number of kinase sets in female, but only a limited number of sets of kinases in male mice. Taken together, our results suggest that male and female 5xFAD mice respond to DUSP4 overexpression via shared and sex-specific molecular mechanisms, which might underly similar reductions in amyloid pathology in both sexes, while learning deficits were reduced in only females with DUSP4 overexpression. Finally, we validated our findings with the sex-specific AD-associated proteomes in human cohorts and further developed DUSP4-centric proteomic network models and signaling maps for each sex.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease associated with memory decline, cognitive impairment, amyloid plaque formation and tau tangles. Neuroinflammation has been shown to be a precursor to apparent amyloid plaque accumulation and subsequent synaptic loss and cognitive decline. In this study, the ability of a novel, small molecule, T-ALZ01, to inhibit neuroinflammatory processes was analyzed. T-ALZ01, an inhibitor of complement component C1r, demonstrated a significant reduction in the levels of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in vitro . An LPS-induced animal model, whereby animals were injected intraperitoneally with 0.5 mg/kg LPS, was used to analyze the effect of T-ALZ01 on neuroinflammation in vivo . Moreover, exosomes (nanosized, endogenous extracellular vehicles) were used as drug delivery vehicles to facilitate intranasal administration of T-ALZ01 across the blood-brain barrier. T-ALZ01 demonstrated significant reduction in degenerating neurons and the activation of resident microglia and astrocytes, as well as inflammatory markers in vivo . This study demonstrates a significant use of small molecule complement inhibitors via exosome drug delivery as a possible therapeutic in disorders characterized by neuroinflammation, such AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Background Identification of modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) onset is an important aspect of controlling the burden imposed by this disease on an increasing number of older U.S. adults. Graves disease (GD), the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the U.S., has been hypothesized to be associated with increased AD risk, but there is no consensus. In this study, we explore the link between GD and risk of clinical AD. Methods Cox and Fine-Grey models were applied to a retrospective propensity-score-matched cohort of 15,505 individuals with GD drawn from a nationally representative 5% sample of U.S. Medicare beneficiaries age 65\u2009+\u2009over the 1991-2017 period. Results Results showed that the presence of GD was associated with a higher risk of AD (Hazard Ratio [HR]:1.15; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]:1.07-1.23). Magnitude of associated risk varied across subgroups: Males (HR:1.19; CI:1.01-1.41), Females (HR:1.09; CI:1.02-1.18), Whites (HR:1.13; CI:1.04-1.20), Blacks (HR:1.33; CI:1.04-1.20). Competing risk estimates were consistent with these findings. Conclusions A potential mechanism connecting GD and AD may involve shared etiological factors between the two diseases. Although replication of our findings is needed, they suggest that GD prevention and treatment may contribute to reducing the burden of AD in U.S. older adults.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits spatially heterogeneous 3R/4R tau pathology distributions across participants, making it a challenge to quantify extent of tau deposition. Utilizing Tau-PET from three independent cohorts, we trained and validated a machine learning model to identify visually positive Tau-PET scans from regional SUVR values and developed a novel summary measure, THETA, that accounts for heterogeneity in tau deposition. The model for identification of tau positivity achieved a balanced test accuracy of 95% and accuracy of \u226587% on the validation datasets. THETA captured heterogeneity of tau deposition, had better association with clinical measures, and corresponded better with visual assessments in comparison with the temporal meta-region-of-interest Tau-PET quantification methods. Our novel approach aids in identification of positive Tau-PET scans and provides a quantitative summary measure, THETA, that effectively captures the heterogeneous tau deposition seen in AD. The application of THETA for quantifying Tau-PET in AD exhibits great potential.",

AD has a significant influence on cognitive functions, particularly memory, resulting in a variety of functional deficits. Given the increasing prevalence of AD, there is an urgent need for the development of effective therapeutic therapies. In a quest to uncover a holistic remedy for AD, a total of 41 bioactive compounds derived from three distinct medicinal plant sources were screened to evaluate their potential to inhibit the active sites of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The insilico screening protocol included 24 licorice-derived compounds, 5 ginkgo biloba-derived compounds, and 11 ginseng-derived compounds. Two compounds (Ginkgolide A and Licorice glycoside D2) were observed to display greater binding energy (BE) relative to the control by interacting with crucial residues in the active site of AChE. Ginkgolide A and Licorice glycoside D2 exhibited BEs of -11.3 and -11.2 kcal/mol, respectively, whereas the control, Donepezil, demonstrated a BE of -10.8 kcal/mol. Further, these compounds exhibit favorable drug-likeness properties. This study suggests that further experimental investigations can be conducted on Ginkgolide A and Licorice glycoside D2 to explore their potential therapeutic applications for AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is more commonly found in women than in men as the risk increases with age. Phytochemicals are screened in silico from Punica granatum peels for their antioxidant activity to be utilized for Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is inhibited by the hormone estrogen, which protects the brain from the bad effects of amyloid beta and acetylcholine (ACh), and is important for memory processing. For the purpose, a library of about 1,000 compounds from P. granatum were prepared and studied by applying integrated computational calculations like 3D-QSAR, molecular docking, MD simulation, ADMET, and density functional theory (DFT). The 3D-QSAR model screened the active compounds B25, B29, B35, B40, B45, B46, B48, B61, and B66 by the field points and activity atlas model from the prepared library. At the molecular level, docking was performed on active compounds for leading hit compounds such as B25 and B35 that displayed a high MolDock score, efficacy, and compatibility with drug delivery against the antioxidant activity. Optimization of the structure and chemical reactivity parameter of the hit compound was calculated by DFT. Moreover, ADMET prediction was evaluated to check the bioavailability and toxicity of the hit compound. Hesperidin (B25) is found to be a hit compound after the whole study and can be synthesized for potent drug discovery in the future.",

The primary objective of our study was to assess the association of depression and heart disease on the risk of dementias like Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia in patients. This retrospective study used electronic health records data that was provided by the HealthVerity\u2122 Marketplace. The characteristics of the patient population were recorded and the risk of dementia was examined using adjusted logistic regression models. The analysis included 49,735 participants and revealed that patients who have heart disease or depression had a higher risk of dementia. Patients who had both heart disease and depression were over three times more likely to have dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and over five times more likely to have vascular dementia compared to patients who only have a diagnosis of heart disease. Depression was associated with a fourfold increase in the risk of dementia. Participants with a diagnosis of most types of heart disease as well as depression had increased risk for developing dementia. This study revealed that patients with both heart disease and depression had increased odds of having dementia as well as vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

CI in dementia and Alzheimer's disease is associated with neuroinflammation. In this study, we investigated a potential role of neuroinflammation in ADT-related CI. Patients with prostate cancer on ADT for \u22653\u2009months were categorized as having ADT-emergent CI or normal cognition (NC) based on self-report at interview. Neuroinflammation was evaluated using positron emission tomography (PET) with the translocator protein (TSPO) radioligand [11C]-PBR28. [11C]-PBR28 uptake in various brain regions was quantified as standardized uptake value (SUVR, normalized to cerebellum) and related to blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) choice-reaction time task (CRT) activation maps. Eleven patients underwent PET: four with reported CI (rCI), six with reported NC (rNC), and one status unrecorded. PET did not reveal any between-group differences in SUVR regionally or globally. There was no difference between groups on brain activation to the CRT. Regardless of the reported cognitive status, there was strong correlation between PET-TSPO signal and CRT activation in the hippocampus, amygdala, and medial cortex. We found no difference in neuroinflammation measured by PET-TSPO between patients with rCI and rNC. However, we speculate that the strong correlation between TSPO uptake and BOLD-fMRI activation in brain regions involved in memory and known to have high androgen-receptor expression mediating plasticity (hippocampus and amygdala) might reflect inflammatory effects of ADT with compensatory upregulated/increased synaptic functions. Further studies of this imaging readout are warranted to investigate ADT-related CI.",

This methodological commentary will correlate recent studies demonstrating the ability of sound waves to carry mass, how the EPIC technique spinal procedure uses a sound wave impulse to create measurable changes in spinal alignment, and the clinical safety and efficacy of this approach. The EPIC technique is a direct genealogical descendant of the technique originally developed by the founding family of chiropractic. With sound wave therapies currently being used to break up kidney stones, called lithotripsy, in physical therapy for the treatment of soft tissue injuries, in the treatment of prostate cancer, and in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, it is possible that the use of sound wave therapies may enter into the realm of altering joint biomechanics. Through a neurovascular examination, the EPIC technique spinal procedure can ascertain the presence of craniocervical subluxation, followed by acquiring multi-dimensional radiographic images for structural analysis. Currently using digital radiographic analysis, the EPIC technique acquires an epigenetic profile of structural asymmetries as well as a multi-directional biomechanical malposition profile of the spine, combining both profiles to ascertain the exact degrees for realignment. EPIC clinics have successfully utilized EPIC on over 20,000 cases. Comparison of pre-treatment biomechanical lateral displacement of the C1 vertebra around the Z-axis measured on digital radiographs, and post-treatment biomechanical lateral displacement of the C1 vertebra measured on digital radiographs immediately following the procedure, demonstrated an average 52% reduction in lateral biomechanical displacement around the Z-axis in a select group of over 2,000 cases.

Consistent with this, disease states such as Alzheimer's disease and insulin-resistant diabetes, that impair cognitive metabolism, impair cognition with this being shown again most prominently for hippocampally mediated processes. In addition to glucose supplied from the blood, brain oxidative metabolism can use local glycogen stores (within astrocytes) as a fuel source via conversion to lactate; both lactate and glycogen have been shown to be important contributors to regulation of cognitive metabolism. Insulin has been shown to be a key regulator of hippocampal cognitive and metabolic processes; in the periphery, insulin facilitates glycogen synthesis and storage, but the impact on brain glycogen is unclear. Furthermore, the impact of diet-induced diabetes on hippocampal glycogen levels and/or metabolism is unknown. Here, we show that in rats with high-fat diet-induced diabetes, hippocampal glycogen is reduced and is less responsive to acute intrahippocampal administration of insulin, which significantly reduces glycogen in the hippocampi of control animals: Our data suggest that impaired fuel availability from glycogen may be a contributing factor to the cognitive impairment seen in disease states that include central insulin resistance.",

Current cellular models for AD often require several months to exhibit phenotypic features due to the lack of an aging environment in vitro. Lamin A is a key component of the nuclear lamina. Progerin, a truncated protein resulting from specific lamin A mutations, causes Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), a disease that prematurely ages individuals. Studies have reported that lamin A expression is induced in the brains of AD patients, and overlapping cellular phenotypes have been observed between HGPS and AD cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of exogenous progerin expression on neural progenitor cells carrying familial AD mutations (FAD). Within three to four weeks of differentiation, these cells exhibited robust AD phenotypes, including increased tau phosphorylation, amyloid plaque accumulation, and an elevated A\u03b242 to A\u03b240 ratio. Additionally, progerin expression significantly increased AD cellular phenotypes such as cell death and cell cycle re-entry.

        "AbstractText": "Accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) aggregates in synapses may contribute to the profound synaptic loss characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The origin of synaptic A\u03b2 aggregates remains elusive, but loss of endosomal proteostasis may trigger their formation.In this study we identified the synaptic compartments where A\u03b2 accumulates and performed a longitudinal analysis of synaptosomes isolated from brains of TgCRND8 APP transgenic mice of either sex. To evaluate the specific contribution of A\u03b2-degrading protease endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE-1) to synaptic/endosomal A\u03b2 homeostasis, we analyzed the effect of partial Ece1 knockout in brain and complete ECE1 knockout in SH-SY5Y cells. Global inhibition of ECE family members was used to further assess their role in preventing synaptic A\u03b2 accumulation.Results showed that, before extracellular amyloid deposition, synapses were burdened with detergent-soluble A\u03b2 monomers, oligomers, and fibrils. Levels of all soluble A\u03b2 species declined thereafter, as A\u03b242 turned progressively insoluble and accumulated in A\u03b2-producing synaptic endosomal vesicles with characteristics of multivesicular bodies. Accordingly, fibrillar A\u03b2 was detected in brain exosomes. ECE-1 deficient mice had significantly increased endogenous synaptosomal A\u03b242 levels and protease inhibitor experiments showed that in TgCRND8 mice, synaptic A\u03b242 became nearly resistant to degradation by ECE-related proteases.Our study supports that A\u03b2 accumulating in synapses is produced locally, within endosomes, and does not require the presence of amyloid plaques. ECE-1 is a determinant factor controlling the accumulation and fibrillization of nascent A\u03b2 in endosomes and, in TgCRND8 mice, A\u03b2 overproduction causes rapid loss of A\u03b242 solubility that curtails ECE-mediated degradation.Significance StatementDeposition of aggregated A\u03b2 in extracellular plaques is a defining feature of AD. A\u03b2 aggregates also accumulate in synapses and may contribute to the profound synaptic loss and cognitive dysfunction typical of the disease. However, it is not clear whether synaptotoxic A\u03b2 is mainly derived from plaques or if it is produced and aggregated locally, within affected synaptic compartments. Filling this knowledge gap is important for the development of an effective treatment for AD, as extracellular and intrasynaptic pools of A\u03b2 may not be equally modulated by immunotherapies or other therapeutic approaches. In this manuscript we provide evidence that A\u03b2 aggregates building up in synapses are formed locally, within synaptic endosomes, due to disruptions in nascent A\u03b2 proteostasis.",

Furthermore, Zebrafish exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of Cr (EC group: 100\u202f\u03bcg/L) for an extended period of 9\u202fweeks exhibited behaviors comparable to those observed in the HC group. Moreover, the study investigated the neuroprotective effects of donepezil (Don), galantamine (Gal) and resveratrol (Res) drugs in response to neurobehavioral impairments induced by Cr (VI) exposure in zebrafish. Don and Res effectively protect the zebrafish from Cr (VI)-induced anxiety, and memory impairment. Furthermore, Cr (VI) exposure induced heightened oxidative stress while simultaneously diminishing antioxidant enzyme levels. Remarkably, these effects were counteracted in the drug-treated groups. Likewise, exposure to Cr (VI) led to an increase in the expression of genes linked to AD and neuroinflammation. Nevertheless, drug treatment reversed this effect in Cr (VI)-exposed fish. The results of our study highlight the potentials of zebrafish model in demonstrating neurobehavioral impairments induced by Cr (VI), thereby paving the way for its utilization in vivo neurobehaviors investigations and pharmaceutical screening.",

Here we report the development of a membrane-permeable peptide that inhibits MARK4 activity in an allosteric manner. The SARS-CoV-2-derived protein Orf9b inhibited MARK4-mediated tau phosphorylation in primary neurons and Drosophila. Orf9b inhibited MARK4 activity in an allosteric manner and did not inhibit the activity of MARK2, which is another MARK family member and is closely related to MARK4. Co-expression of Orf9b in the fly retina expressing human tau and MARK4 suppressed phosphorylation of tau at the microtubule-binding repeats and tau-induced neurodegeneration. We identified the minimal sequence of Orf9b required to suppress MARK4 activity and fused it to a cell-permeable sequence (TAT-Orf9b10-18_78-95). Extracellular supplementation of TAT-Orf9b10-18_78-95 inhibited MARK4 activity in primary neurons, and feeding TAT-Orf9b10-18_78-95 to a fly model of tauopathy lowered phospho-tau levels and suppressed neurodegeneration.

The resultant variant with a 69 amino acid signal peptide, designated N-BChE, could play a role in AD development. Here, we report that the signal sequence of the BChE, if produced in an extended 69 aa version, can self-aggregate and could form seeds that enhance amyloid fibril formation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner and create larger co-aggregates.

        "ArticleTitle": "Electroacupuncture stimulation to modulate neural oscillations in promoting neurological rehabilitation.",
        "AbstractText": "Electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation is a modern neuromodulation technique that integrates traditional Chinese acupuncture therapy with contemporary electrical stimulation. It involves the application of electrical currents to specific acupoints on the body following acupuncture. EA has been widely used in the treatment of various neurological disorders, including epilepsy, stroke, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Recent research suggests that EA stimulation may modulate neural oscillations, correcting abnormal brain electrical activity, promoting brain function, and aiding in neurological rehabilitation. This paper conducted a comprehensive search in databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI using keywords like \"electroacupuncture,\" \"neural oscillations,\" and \"neurorehabilitation\", covering the period from year 1980 to 2023. We provide a detailed overview of how electroacupuncture stimulation modulates neural oscillations, including maintaining neural activity homeostasis, influencing neurotransmitter release, improving cerebral hemodynamics, and enhancing specific neural functional networks. The paper also discusses the current state of research, limitations of electroacupuncture-induced neural oscillation techniques, and explores prospects for their combined application, aiming to offer broader insights for both basic and clinical research.",

        "AbstractText": "GV1001 protects neural cells from amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) toxicity and other stressors in in vitro studies and demonstrates clinically beneficial effects in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigated the protective effects and mechanism of action of GV1001 in triple transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice. We found that GV1001 improved memory and cognition in middle- and old-aged 3xTg-AD mice. Additionally, it reduced A\u03b2 oligomer and phospho-tau (Ser202 and Thr205) levels in the brain, and mitigated neuroinflammation by promoting a neuroprotective microglial and astrocyte phenotype while diminishing the neurotoxic ones. In vitro, GV1001 bound to gonadotropin releasing hormone receptors (GnRHRs) with high affinity. Levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, a direct downstream effector of activated GnRHRs, increased after GV1001 treatment. Furthermore, inhibition of GnRHRs blocked GV1001-induced effects. Thus, GV1001 might improve cognitive and memory functions of 3xTg-AD mice by suppressing neuroinflammation and reducing A\u03b2 oligomers levels and phospho-tau by activating GnRHRs and their downstream signaling pathways.",

        "AbstractText": "Accurate segmentation of the hippocampus from the brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) is a crucial task in the neuroimaging research, since its structural integrity is strongly related to several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Automatic segmentation of the hippocampus structures is challenging due to the small volume, complex shape, low contrast and discontinuous boundaries of hippocampus. Although some methods have been developed for the hippocampus segmentation, most of them paid too much attention to the hippocampus shape and volume instead of considering the spatial information. Additionally, the extracted features are independent of each other, ignoring the correlation between the global and local information. In view of this, here we proposed a novel cross-layer dual Encoding-Shared Decoding network framework with Spatial self-Attention mechanism (called ESDSA) for hippocampus segmentation in human brains. Considering that the hippocampus is a relatively small part in MRI, we introduced the spatial self-attention mechanism in ESDSA to capture the spatial information of hippocampus for improving the segmentation accuracy. We also designed a cross-layer dual encoding-shared decoding network to effectively extract the global information of MRIs and the spatial information of hippocampus. The spatial features of hippocampus and the features extracted from the MRIs were combined to realize the hippocampus segmentation. Results on the baseline T1-weighted structural MRI data show that the performance of our ESDSA is superior to other state-of-the-art methods, and the dice similarity coefficient of ESDSA achieves 89.37%. In addition, the dice similarity coefficient of the Spatial Self-Attention mechanism (SSA) strategy and the dual Encoding-Shared Decoding (ESD) strategy is 9.47%, 5.35% higher than that of the baseline U-net, respectively, indicating that the strategies of SSA and ESD can effectively enhance the segmentation accuracy of human brain hippocampus.",

This vesicle-clustering activity depends on a specific interaction of \u03b1-Syn with anionic phospholipids. Here, we report that \u03b1-Syn surprisingly also interacts with the neutral phospholipid lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC). Even in the absence of anionic lipids, lysoPC facilitates \u03b1-Syn-induced vesicle clustering but has no effect on Ca2+-triggered fusion in a single vesicle-vesicle fusion assay. The A30P mutant of \u03b1-Syn that causes familial Parkinson disease has a reduced affinity to lysoPC and does not induce vesicle clustering. Taken together, the \u03b1-Syn-lysoPC interaction may play a role in \u03b1-Syn function.",

        "AbstractText": "Adolescents experience relatively more stress than other populations as they are facing rapid physical changes and adapting to complex social environments. However, access for this population to professional service providers is limited. Therefore, there is an increasing need for access to mental health services and new mental health care resources tailored to adolescents. The aim of this study was to evaluate the functionality and effectiveness of a school digital mental health clinic (DMHC) created by a Chinese psychiatric hospital and provided to secondary school students for a trial. The trial period of the DMHC was from January to July 2021 at three secondary schools in Taizhou City, China. Under a collaborative agreement between the local educational bureau and provider, use of the DMHC was free to all students, teachers, and staff of the schools. The functionality of the DMHC was compared with existing digital health interventions introduced in the literature and its effectiveness was quantitatively analyzed in terms of the volume of received counseling calls, number of calls per 100 students, length and time of calls, and reasons for the calls. The mini course video views were analyzed by topics and viewing time. The design functions of the DMHC are well aligned with required factors defined in the literature. The first advantage of this DMHC is its high accessibility to students in the three schools. All functions of the DMHC are free to use by students, thereby eliminating the economic barriers to seeking and receiving care. Students can receive virtual counseling during or after regular working hours. Acceptability of the DHMC was further ensured by the full support from a national top-tier mental health facility. Any audio or video call from a student user would connect them to a live, qualified professional (ie, a psychiatrist or psychologist). Options are provided to view and listen to resources for stress relief or tips to help address mental health needs. The major reasons for the counseling calls included difficulties in learning, interpersonal relationships, and emotional distress. The three topics with the highest level of interest for the mini course videos were emotional assistance, personal growth, and family member relationships. The DMHC served as an effective tool for crisis prevention and intervention during nonworking hours as most of the live calls and mini video viewing occurred after school or over the weekend. Furthermore, the DMHC helped three students at high risk for suicide and self-injury through live-call intervention. The DMHC is an effective complementary solution to improve access to professional mental health care facilities, especially during nonworking hours, thereby helping adolescents meet their mental health needs. Extension of the DMHC into more schools and other settings is recommended.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalently neurodegenerative disease characterized by neuronal damage which is associated with amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation. Hederagenin is a triterpenoid saponin, exerting anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumoral, and neuroprotective activities. However, its role in AD progression is still obscure. The aim of this study was to explore the influences of hederagenin on A\u03b2-caused neuronal injury in vitro. Neuronal cells were treated with A\u03b225-35 (A\u03b2) to establish a cellular model of AD. Cell viability was assessed using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). Oxidative stress was evaluated by detecting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Apoptosis was investigated using TUNEL staining and caspase-3 activity assays. Protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 1 (PTPN1) was screened by bioinformatics analysis. Protein levels of PTPN1 and protein kinase B (Akt) were measured by western blotting. Hederagenin (2.5, 5, and 10\u00a0\u03bcM) alone did not affect viability of neuronal cells, but relieved A\u03b2-induced viability reduction. Hederagenin mitigated A\u03b2-induced increase in ROS accumulation and decrease in SOD activity. Hederagenin attenuated A\u03b2-induced increase in apoptotic rate and caspase-3 activity. PTPN1 was screened as a target of hederagenin against AD by bioinformatics analysis. Hederagenin treatment resisted A\u03b2-induced decrease in PTPN1 mRNA and protein levels in neuronal cells. PTPN1 silencing attenuated the suppressive functions of hederagenin in A\u03b2-stimulated oxidative stress and apoptosis. Hederagenin mitigated A\u03b2-induced Akt signaling inactivation by upregulating PTPN1 expression. In conclusion, hederagenin attenuates oxidative stress and apoptosis in neuronal cells stimulated with A\u03b2 by promoting PTPN1/Akt signaling activation.",

While high-dimensional multi-omics data have provided unprecedented data resources for prediction studies, their high-dimensionality and complex inter/intra-relationships have posed significant analytical challenges. We proposed a two-step Bayesian linear mixed model framework (TBLMM) for risk prediction analysis on multi-omics data.

It can resemble the shape of the true effect size distributions and accounts for non-linear, including interaction effects, among multi-omics data via kernel fusion. It infers its parameters via a computationally efficient variational Bayes algorithm. Through extensive simulation studies and the prediction analyses on the PET-imaging outcomes using data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we have demonstrated that TBLMM can consistently outperform the existing method in predicting the risk of complex traits.

Untreated RBD carries risks for physical injury from falls or other traumatic events during dream enactment as well as risk of injury to the bed partner. Currently, melatonin and clonazepam are the mainstay pharmacological therapies for RBD. However, therapeutic response to these medications is variable. While older adults are most vulnerable to RBD, they are also particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, including increased risk of falls, cognitive impairment, and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Prazosin is a centrally active alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist often prescribed for trauma nightmares characterized by REM sleep without atonia in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. We report a case of successful RBD management with prazosin in a patient in whom high dose melatonin was ineffective. Although there was no observable reduction of dream-enactment behaviors with high dose melatonin, the possibility of a synergistic effect of prazosin combined with melatonin cannot be ruled out.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological disorder with variability in pathology and clinical progression. AD patients may differ in individual-level benefit from amyloid beta removal therapy. Random forest models were applied to the EMERGE trial to create an individual-level treatment response (ITR) score which represents individual-level benefit of high-dose aducanumab relative to the placebo. This ITR score was used to test the existence of heterogeneity in treatment effect (HTE). We found statistical evidence of HTE in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB;P\u00a0=\u00a0 0.034). The observed CDR-SB benefit was 0.79 points greater in the group with the top 25% of ITR score compared to the remaining 75% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.020). Of note, the highest treatment responders had lower hippocampal volume, higher plasma phosphorylated tau 181 and a shorter duration of clinical AD at baseline. This ITR analysis provides a proof of concept for precision medicine in future AD research and drug development. Emerging trials have shown a population-level benefit from amyloid beta (A\u03b2) removal in slowing cognitive decline in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). This work demonstrates significant heterogeneity of individual-level treatment effect of aducanumab in early AD.

Here, we studied the propitious role of E3 ubiquitin ligase Pirh2 in A\u03b2 protein aggregation in view of its regulatory ligase activity in the ubiquitin-proteasome system\u00a0employing both cellular and sporadic rodent models of AD. Pirh2 protein abundance was significantly increased during Streptozotocin (STZ) induced AD conditions, and transient silencing of Pirh2 significantly inhibited the A\u03b2 aggregation and modified the dendrite morphology along with the substantial decrease in choline level in the differentiated neurons. MALDI-TOF/TOF, coimmunoprecipitation, and UbcH7-linked in vitro ubiquitylation analysis confirmed the high interaction of Pirh2 with chaperone GRP78. Furthermore, Pirh2 silencing inhibits the STZ induced altered level of endoplasmic reticulum stress and intracellular Ca2+ levels in neuronal N2a cells. Pirh2 silencing also inhibited the AD conditions related to the altered protein abundance of HSP90 and its co-chaperones which may collectively involve in the reduced burden of amyloid aggregates in neuronal cells. Pirh2 silencing further stabilized the nuclear translocation of phospho-Nrf2 and inhibited the altered level of autophagy factors. Taken together, our data indicated that Pirh2 is critically involved in STZ induced AD pathogenesis through its interaction with ER-chaperone GRP78, improves the neuronal connectivity, affects the altered level of chaperones, co-chaperones, & autophagic markers, and collectively inhibits the A\u03b2 aggregation.",

Recent studies have suggested the association of obsessive-compulsive disorder with the early stages of AD. However, there is a lack of understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of compulsive-like behaviors at the neuronal circuit level and their relationship with AD. We have addressed this issue in an amyloid-\u03b2 1-42-induced mouse model of AD by studying compulsive-like behaviors. Next, we compared the hippocampal and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) local field potential pattern and coherence between these regions of control and AD mice. We also assessed the expression pattern of acetylcholine and glutamatergic signaling in these regions, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Our findings show that AD mice exhibit compulsive-like behaviors, as evidenced by enhanced marble burying, nest building, and burrowing. Furthermore, AD mice exhibited hippocampo-cortical circuit dysfunction demonstrated by decreased power of rhythmic oscillations at the theta (4-12 Hz) and gamma (25-50 Hz) frequencies in the hippocampus and mPFC, two functionally interconnected brain regions involved both in AD and compulsive behaviors. Importantly, coherence between the hippocampus and mPFC in the theta band of AD animals was significantly reduced. Furthermore, we found reduced cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus and mPFC of AD mice. We conclude that the hippocampo-cortical functional alterations may play a significant role in mediating the compulsive-like behaviors observed in AD mice.

The aim of this qualitative literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO with keywords related to online, support group, caregiver, and dementia was to collect the reported experiences by the end of 2022. Peer reviewed journal papers were included when published and written in English. After the joint decision of two reviewers, it was decided to only include studies that were published in Medline. The results of the literature search are compared with experiences of the participants in a presentation group that was transformed into an online group at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic via Zoom. In search yielded a total of 129 articles. 113 articles described different types of interventions, 30 of which had a randomized design.

Though recent clinical trials of novel drugs that target A\u03b2 have demonstrated promising preliminary data, these pharmaceuticals have a poor history of developing into AD treatments, leading to hypotheses that other therapeutic targets may be more suitable for AD prevention and treatment. Impaired brain energy metabolism is another pathological hallmark that precedes the onset of AD that may provide a target for intervention. The brain creatine (Cr) system plays a crucial role in maintaining bioenergetic flux and is disrupted in AD. Recent studies using AD mouse models have shown that supplementing with Cr improves brain bioenergetics, as well as AD biomarkers and cognition. Despite these promising findings, no human trials have investigated the potential benefits of Cr supplementation in AD.

A linear regression model controlled for age, sex and vascular risk factors including neurogranin, T-tau, and GFAP, resulted in adjusted R2\u2009=\u20090.06, p\u2009=\u20090.047. The A\u03b242/40 ratio was bimodally distributed across all samples, as well as in the subgroups of improved and unimproved patients but did not contribute to outcome prediction. The preoperative MMSE score was lower within the low A\u03b2 ratio group (median 25, IQR 23-28) compared to the high subgroup (26, 24-29) (p\u2009=\u20090.028). The T-Tau x A\u03b240/42 ratio and P-tau x A\u03b240/42 ratio did not contribute to shunt response prediction. The prevalence of vascular risk factors did not affect shunt response. A higher preoperative ventricular CSF level of neurogranin, which is a postsynaptic marker, may signal a favorable postoperative outcome. Concentrations of a panel of ventricular CSF biomarkers explained only 6% of the variability in outcome. Evidence of amyloid or tau pathology did not affect the outcome.",

        "AbstractText": "Plasma levels of vitamin D have been reported to be low in persons with Down syndrome (DS) and existing data is limited to small and homogenous cohorts. This is of particular importance in persons with DS given the high rates of autoimmune disease in this population and the known relationship between vitamin D and immune function. This study sought to investigate vitamin D status in a multi-center cohort of individuals with DS and compare them to individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neurotypical (NT) controls. A retrospective, multi-center review was performed. The three sites were located at latitudes of 42.361145, 37.44466, and 34.05349. Patients were identified by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 or ICD-10 codes for DS, ASD, or well-child check visits for NT individuals. The first vitamin D 25-OH level recorded in the electronic medical record (EMR) was used in this study as it was felt to be the most reflective of a natural and non-supplemented state. Vitamin D 25-OH levels below 30 ng/mL were considered deficient. In total, 1624 individuals with DS, 5208 with ASD, and 30,775 NT controls were identified. Individuals with DS had the lowest mean level of vitamin D 25-OH at 20.67 ng/mL, compared to those with ASD (23.48 ng/mL) and NT controls (29.20 ng/mL) (p < 0.001, 95% CI: -8.97 to -6.44). A total of 399 (24.6%) individuals with DS were considered vitamin D deficient compared to 1472 (28.3%) with ASD and 12,397 (40.3%) NT controls (p < 0.001, 95% CI: -5.43 to -2.36). Individuals with DS with higher body mass index (BMI) were found to be more likely to have lower levels of vitamin D (p < 0.001, 95% CI: -0.3849 to -0.1509). Additionally, having both DS and a neurologic diagnosis increased the likelihood of having lower vitamin D levels (p < 0.001, 95% CI: -5.02 to -1.28). Individuals with DS and autoimmune disease were much more likely to have lower vitamin D levels (p < 0.001, 95% CI: -6.22 to -1.55). Similarly, a history of autoimmunity in a first-degree relative also increased the likelihood of having lower levels of vitamin D in persons with DS (p = 0.01, 95% CI: -2.45 to -0.63). Individuals with DS were noted to have hypovitaminosis D in comparison to individuals with ASD and NT controls. Associations between vitamin D deficiency and high BMI, personal autoimmunity, and familial autoimmunity were present in individuals with DS.",

Risk factors associated with this impairment include advanced age, severe infection, and prolonged duration of anosmia (loss of smell). Furthermore, COVID-19 has been reported as a risk factor for Alzheimer disease, and even mild infections have been associated with visuospatial cognitive impairments. While multiple pathophysiological mechanisms have been implicated in COVID-19-related cognitive impairment, persistent infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is of particular interest due to its potential implications for treatment. Persistent infection could lead to cognitive impairments through mechanisms such as neurotoxicity mediated by spike proteins, neuroinflammation induced by cytokines, and neuronal cell fusion (syncytia). In terms of treatment, the effectiveness of vaccination has been demonstrated in meta-analyses, and drugs like metformin and antiviral agents hold promise.",

        "AbstractText": "It has been suggested that higher triglyceride levels were associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. This study aimed to examine the association of triglycerides with dementia and cognition change in community-dwelling older adults. This prospective longitudinal study used data from the ASPREE randomized trial of adults aged \u226565 years without dementia or previous cardiovascular events at enrolment. The main outcome was incident dementia. Other outcomes included changes in composite cognition and domain-specific cognition (global cognition, memory, language and executive function, and psychomotor speed). The association between baseline triglycerides and dementia risk was estimated using Cox proportional-hazard models adjusting for relevant risk factors. Linear mixed models were used to investigate cognitive change. The analysis was repeated in a sub-cohort of participants with available APOE-\u03b54 genetic data with additional adjustment for APOE-\u03b54 carrier status, and an external cohort (UK Biobank) with similar selection criteria applied. The study included 18,294 ASPREE participants and 68,200 UK Biobank participants (mean age: 75.1 & 66.9 years; female: 56.3% & 52.7%; median [IQR] triglyceride:106 [80-142]mg/dl & 139 [101-193]mg/dl), with dementia recorded in 823 and 2,778 individuals over a median follow-up of 6.4 and 12.5 years, respectively. Higher triglyceride levels were associated with lower dementia risk in the entire ASPREE cohort (HR with doubling of TG: 0.82, 95% CI 0.72-0.94). Findings were similar in the sub-cohort of participants with APOE-\u03b54 genetic data (n=13,976), and in the UK Biobank cohort (HR was 0.82 and 0.83, respectively, all p\u22640.01). Higher triglycerides were also associated with slower decline in global, composite cognition, and memory over time (p\u22640.05). Older adults with higher triglyceride levels within the normal to high-normal range had a lower dementia risk and slower cognitive decline over time compared to individuals with lower triglyceride levels. Higher triglyceride levels may be reflective of better overall health and/or lifestyle behaviors that would protect against dementia development. Future studies are warranted to investigate whether specific components within the total circulating pool of plasma triglycerides may promote better cognitive function, with the hope of informing the development of new preventive strategies.",

        "ArticleTitle": "[Alzheimer's disease classification based on nonlinear high-order features and hypergraph convolutional neural network].",
        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that damages patients' memory and cognitive abilities. Therefore, the diagnosis of AD holds significant importance. The interactions between regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain often involve multiple areas collaborating in a nonlinear manner. Leveraging these nonlinear higher-order interaction features to their fullest potential contributes to enhancing the accuracy of AD diagnosis. To address this, a framework combining nonlinear higher-order feature extraction and three-dimensional (3D) hypergraph neural networks is proposed for computer-assisted diagnosis of AD. First, a support vector machine regression model based on the radial basis function kernel was trained on ROI data to obtain a base estimator. Then, a recursive feature elimination algorithm based on the base estimator was applied to extract nonlinear higher-order features from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. These features were subsequently constructed into a hypergraph, leveraging the complex interactions captured in the data. Finally, a four-dimensional (4D) spatiotemporal hypergraph convolutional neural network model was constructed based on the fMRI data for classification. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the Hyper Graph Convolutional Network (HyperGCN) framework by 8% and traditional two-dimensional (2D) linear feature extraction methods by 12% in the AD/normal control (NC) classification task. In conclusion, this framework demonstrates an improvement in AD classification compared to mainstream deep learning methods, providing valuable evidence for computer-assisted diagnosis of AD. \u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c7\uff08AD\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u8f6c\u7684\u5927\u8111\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u5316\u6027\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u60a3\u8005\u8bb0\u5fc6\u529b\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0cAD\u8bca\u65ad\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u5927\u8111\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\uff08ROI\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u591a\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u534f\u540c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6b64\u7c7b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8AD\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u9636\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u8d85\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684AD\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u9996\u5148\u9488\u5bf9ROI\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f84\u5411\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u6838\u7684\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u57fa\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u9664\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u53d6\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u6210\u50cf\uff08fMRI\uff09\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u9636\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u6784\u9020\u6210\u8d85\u56fe\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u57fa\u4e8efMRI\u6570\u636e\u7684\u56db\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u6027\u642d\u5efa\u8d85\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c7\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u5021\u8bae\uff08ADNI\uff09\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5728AD/\u6b63\u5e38\u5bf9\u7167\uff08NC\uff09\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8eHyper Graph Convolutional Network\uff08HyperGCN\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e868%\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8612%\u3002\u7efc\u4e0a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u6846\u67b6\u5728AD\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u8f83\u4e3b\u6d41\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3aAD\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u4f9d\u636e\u3002.",

Using a proximity extension assay, we aimed to identify candidate serum protein biomarkers for disease activity in CIDP. We collected clinical data and serum of 106 patients with CIDP. Patients starting induction treatment (n=53) and patients on maintenance treatment starting treatment withdrawal (n=40) were assessed at baseline and at 6\u2009months (or at relapse). Patients in remission (n=13) were assessed once. Clinical disease activity was defined based on improvement or deterioration by the minimal clinically important difference on the inflammatory Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale in combination with either grip strength or the Medical Research Council sum score. Using a proximity extension assay (Olink Explore platform), 1472 protein levels were analysed in serum. Candidate proteins were selected based on fold change>0.5\u2009or <-0.5\u2009and p<0.05 between clinically active and inactive disease. Longitudinal changes of candidate proteins between baseline and follow-up were analysed. We identified 48 candidate proteins that differed between clinically active and inactive disease on cross-sectional comparison. Five of these proteins (SUGT1, IRAK4, DCTN1, 5'-nucleotidase cytosolic IIIA (NT5C3A), glutaredoxin (GLRX)) also showed longitudinal changes consistent with disease activity changes. IRAK4 was also identified in a sensitivity analysis, using another definition for disease activity. Our results indicate that IRAK4 and possibly SUGT1, DCTN1, NT5C3A and GLRX are candidate biomarkers for monitoring clinical disease activity in CIDP.",

Patients aged \u226550 with newly diagnosed AD (N\u00a0= 56,904) were identified during 2017-2019 and categorized into insomnia and non-insomnia groups based on billing codes recorded in medical and pharmacy claims. The index date was defined as the earliest date of diagnosis/medication of insomnia. The new diagnosis of AD had to be established within 12\u00a0months before (baseline) or 3\u00a0months after the index date. Point prevalence of behavioral symptoms was estimated during baseline and the 12-month follow-up period. Propensity score matching was performed to match patients with and without insomnia. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to assess the risk of diagnosis of behavioral symptoms among insomnia and non-insomnia groups. The study cohort included 7808 patients with newly diagnosed AD (mean age\u00a0= 79.4, SD\u00a0= 9.6\u00a0years).

Syntactic, lexical, and semantic features were assessed via the NILC-Metrix software, and the features were correlated with episodic, working, and semantic memory assessment. Differences were found in 7 of the 34 features assessed. Syntactically, the group diagnosed with AD produced narratives with fewer sentences, fewer words per sentence, and lower Yngve depth scores. Lexically, the AD group produced narratives with fewer words and prepositions per sentence. Semantically, the narratives produced by the AD group featured words with a lower mean age of acquisition, and lower Brun\u00e9t's index scores. For the CG group, episodic memory performance correlated with the ratio of conjunctions. No other significant correlation was found for semantic and working memory in the CG. No correlation was found between memory performance and linguistic features for the AD group. The automatic assessment of linguistic features showed impaired narrative recall in participants diagnosed with AD relative to healthy controls at the syntactic, lexical, and semantic levels of discourse. These findings corroborate previous literature showing a decline in discourse production performance resulting from cognitive impairment in AD. The assessment of linguistic performance through a narrative recall task provides valuable insights into cognitive decline related to Alzheimer's disease.",

However, its aberrant activation could cause amplification of inflammatory effects, thereby triggering a range of ailments, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cancer. For the past few years, as an attractive anti-inflammatory target, NLRP3-targeting small-molecule inhibitors have been widely reported by both the academic and the industrial communities. In order to deeply understand the advancement of NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, we provide comprehensive insights and commentary on drugs currently under clinical investigation, as well as other NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors from a chemical structure point of view, with an aim to provide new insights for the further development of clinical drugs for NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "Latinos caring for a person with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) have the highest prevalence of caregiving. Yet, they are less likely to benefit from evidence-based interventions given their continued underrepresentation in ADRD-related research. Community advisory boards (CABs) have the potential to address barriers to research for underrepresented communities; however, there are complexities to establishing and sustaining CABs. This article describes how our work addressed challenges in CABs related to unbalanced power relations, language barriers, the value of time, and low research knowledge and health literacy. Nine Latino CAB members, including older Latino caregivers, were trained in a comprehensive program designed to increase knowledge about health research methods and ethics, cognitive health, and cultural adaptation methods. Members completed pre- and post-training measures of Alzheimer's disease knowledge, attitudes and beliefs toward research, and a satisfaction survey. Results from the satisfaction questionnaire indicated that the program was well received. CAB members increased their knowledge regarding management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia and dementia-associated risk factors and treatment. Positive changes in members' attitudes toward research included increased willingness to participate in trials and subject protection measures. Formalized training in research conduct and ethics and health literacy is a promising strategy to reduce challenges in establishing and maintaining CABs and can also optimize CAB impact to address gaps in older Latino ADRD caregiving research.",

        "AbstractText": "Growing epidemiological evidence suggests an adverse relationship between exposure to air pollutants and cognitive health, and this could be related to the effect of air pollution on vascular health. We aim to evaluate the association between air pollution exposure and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) marker of cerebral vascular burden, white matter hyperintensities (WMH). This cross-sectional analysis used data from the French Three-City Montpellier study. Randomly selected participants 65-80 years of age underwent an MRI examination to estimate their total and regional cerebral WMH volumes. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and black carbon (BC) at the participants' residential address during the 5 years before the MRI examination was estimated with land use regression models. Multinomial and binomial logistic regression assessed the associations between exposure to each of the three pollutants and categories of total and lobar WMH volumes. Participants' (n=582) median age at MRI was 70.7 years [interquartile range (IQR): 6.1], and 52% (n=300) were women. Median exposure to air pollution over the 5 years before MRI acquisition was 24.3 (IQR: 1.7) \u03bcg/m3 for PM2.5, 48.9 (14.6) \u03bcg/m3 for NO2, and 2.66 (0.60) 10-5/m for BC. We found no significant association between exposure to the three air pollutants and total WMH volume. We found that PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with higher risk of temporal lobe WMH burden [odds ratio (OR) for an IQR increase=1.82 (95% confidence interval: 1.41, 2.36) for the second volume tercile, 2.04 (1.59, 2.61) for the third volume tercile, reference: first volume tercile]. Associations for other regional WMH volumes were inconsistent. In this population-based study in older adults, PM2.5 exposure was associated with increased risk of high WMH volume in the temporal lobe, strengthening the evidence on PM2.5 adverse effect on the brain. Further studies looking at different markers of cerebrovascular damage are still needed to document the potential vascular effects of air pollution. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12231.",

Previous studies suggest diverse factors contribute to dementia-related anxiety, including emotional, social, and cognitive concerns. A mixed methods investigation was designed to explore DRA's underlying causes; we present a thematic analysis of these causes. A semi-structured qualitative interview design was used to explore participants' thoughts, feelings, and reactions about dementia. Fifty community-dwelling adults (aged 58 to 89, M = 70.80, SD = 6.02) without dementia diagnoses were interviewed, with a focus on why dementias are anxiety provoking diagnoses. We engaged in a reflexive inductive thematic approach. We identified seven themes positioned within previously established antecedents of DRA. Anticipated consequences were conveyed in statements identifying dementia as a feared diagnosis and its connection to how one would be treated if diagnosed. Low perceived control was associated with dementias' anticipated effects including the ability of dementia to undermine core aspects of one's personhood, limit independence, and increase reliance on others. Perceived risk was connected to past familial experiences with dementia and the implications of receiving different diagnoses with different trajectories and treatments. Findings offer insight into diverse factors contributing to DRA, which can be used to inform public health messaging and develop applicable and clinically relevant interventions to meet the needs of individuals experiencing DRA and their social support systems.",

The main type of aggregates, the paired helical filaments (PHF), incorporate about 20% of the full-length protein into the rigid core. Recently, cryo-electron microscopy data showed that a protease-resistant fragment of tau (residues 297-391) self-assembles in vitro in the presence of divalent cations to form twisted filaments whose molecular structure resembles that of AD PHF tau [S. L\u00f6vestam et al., Elife 11, e76494 (2022)]. To investigate whether this tau construct is uniquely predisposed to this morphology and structure, we fibrillized tau (297-391) under the reported conditions and determined its structure using solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Unexpectedly, the protein assembled predominantly into nontwisting ribbons whose rigid core spans residues 305-357. This rigid core forms a \u03b2-arch that turns at residues 322CGS324. Two protofilaments stack together via a long interface that stretches from G323 to I354. Together, these two protofilaments form a four-layered \u03b2-sheet core whose sidechains are stabilized by numerous polar and hydrophobic interactions. This structure gives insight into the fibril morphologies and molecular conformations that can be adopted by this protease-resistant core of AD tau under different pH and ionic conditions.",

The characteristic pathological manifestation of AD includes the deposition of extracellular insoluble \u03b2 amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles formed from hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Cost effective and minimally invasive peripheral blood-based biomarkers are critical for early AD diagnosis. Currently, the plasma based two fraction of \u03b2 amyloid peptide ratio (A\u03b242/40) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) are considered as blood-based biomarkers for AD diagnosis. Recent research indicates that oxidative stress (OS) occurs prior to amyloid plaque (A\u03b2) formation and abnormal tau phosphorylation in AD. The imbalance of the master antioxidant, glutathione (GSH), and prooxidants (iron, zinc, and copper)\u2500plays a crucial role in AD neurodegeneration. We present peripheral blood-based OS related biomarkers that are mechanistically involved in the disease process and may serve as a novel screening tool for early detection of AD onset. This OS based approach may also provide a quick and cost efficient method to monitor the effects of disease-modifying therapies in AD clinical trials.",

        "AbstractText": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects adults worldwide. Recent evidence suggests that AD may be associated with cognitive dysfunction, but the results of individual studies have been inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between AD and cognitive dysfunction in middle-aged and older adults. To find relevant research, a comprehensive search of electronic databases from the beginning to March 2023 was carried out. Data were taken from studies that were eligible, and a meta-analysis was done to determine the pooled hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). We searched three databases and found a total of 15 studied arms included in 5 cohort studies with over 8.5 million participants were included in the analysis. The results showed that individuals with AD had a higher risk of developing dementia of all-cause dementia (pooled hazard ratio (HR) = 1.16; 95% CI, 1.10-1.23,P<0.001) and the Alzheimer type (pooled HR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.01-1.63,P<0.001) but not vascular dementia (pooled HR = 1.42; 95% CI, 0.99-2.04,P<0.001). Subgroup analyses showed that the association between atopic dermatitis and all-cause dementia was significant in Europe (P = 0.004) but not in Asia (P = 0.173) and was significant in prospective cohort studies (P<0.001) but not in non-prospective cohort studies (P = 0.068). Sensitivity analysis and publication bias detection confirmed the reliability of the overall findings. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that AD was associated with increased risk of cognitive dysfunction, particularly dementia of the Alzheimer type and all-cause dementia, in middle-aged and older participants. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind this association and its potential implications for clinical practice. PROSPERO, identifier (CRD42023411627).",

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of individual cognitive training programs based on virtual reality (VR), a nonpharmacological intervention, on cognitive function and depression in middle-aged women at risk of cognitive impairment. It used VR technology, which has recently been recognized as a promising tool. We administered a VR-based cognitive training program for 30 minutes daily, twice a week, for 12 weeks (24 sessions). This study included middle-aged women residing in older adults' welfare facilities in G-gu, Busan, from May to August 2021. A total of 60 participants were randomly divided into the training (n=30) and control (n=30) groups. Cognitive and depressive functions were assessed using the Korean versions of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (K-MoCA), Digit Span Test (DST), Korean-Color Word Stroop Test (K-CWST), and Short Form of the Geriatric Depression Scale (SGDS-K) before the intervention. The training group underwent a VR-based cognitive training program, whereas the control group was educated to maintain regular daily activities. The same assessments were performed 12 weeks after treatment. A comparison of the mean scores before and after K-MoCA in the training group revealed a significant increase from 24.87 (SD 2.62) to 27.50 (SD 1.70; P<.01), indicating substantial cognitive improvement. Similarly, the mean DST forward scores increased significantly from 6.97 (SD 1.10) to 7.90 (SD 1.18; P<.01), suggesting enhanced short-term auditory memory and attention. The mean DST backward scores also showed a significant improvement from 4.10 (SD 0.71) to 4.77 (SD 1.2; P=.01). Notably, the mean SGDS-K scores decreased significantly from 3.97 (SD 2.51) to 2.13 (SD 1.87; P<.01), indicating a reduction in depression within the training group. The VR-based cognitive training programs significantly enhanced cognitive function and reduced depression in middle-aged women. Consequently, these programs are considered beneficial nonpharmacological cognitive training interventions for middle-aged women at high risk of cognitive impairment.

This past work also demonstrated that people with dementia do not perceive English digital dementia information as emotionally or cognitively accessible. In this study, we sought to investigate the readability; linguistic, psychological, and emotional characteristics; and target audiences of digital dementia information. We conducted a textual analysis of 3 different types of text-based digital dementia information written in English: 300 medical articles, 35 websites, and 50 blogs. We assessed the text's readability using the Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level measurements, as well as tone, analytical thinking, clout, authenticity, and word frequencies using a natural language processing tool, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count Generator. We also conducted a thematic analysis to categorize the target audiences for each information source and used these categorizations for further statistical analysis. The median Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level readability score and Flesch Reading Ease score for all types of information (N=1139) were 12.1 and 38.6, respectively, revealing that the readability scores of all 3 information types were higher than the minimum requirement. We found that medical articles had significantly (P=.05) higher word count and analytical thinking scores as well as significantly lower clout, authenticity, and emotional tone scores than websites and blogs. Further, blogs had significantly (P=.48) higher word count and authenticity scores but lower analytical scores than websites. Using thematic analysis, we found that most of the blogs (156/227, 68.7%) and web pages (399/612, 65.2%) were targeted at people with dementia. Website information targeted at a general audience had significantly lower readability scores. In addition, website information targeted at people with dementia had higher word count and lower emotional tone ratings. The information on websites targeted at caregivers had significantly higher clout and lower authenticity scores. Our findings indicate that there is an abundance of digital dementia information written in English that is targeted at people with dementia, but this information is not readable by a general audience. This is problematic considering that people with <12 years of education are at a higher risk of developing dementia. Further, our findings demonstrate that digital dementia information written in English has a negative tone, which may be a contributing factor to the mental health crisis many people with dementia face after receiving a diagnosis. Therefore, we call for content creators to lower readability scores to make the information more accessible to a general audience and to focus their efforts on providing information in a way that does not perpetuate overly negative narratives of dementia.",

        "AbstractText": "Fatty acids are metabolized by \u03b2-oxidation within the \"mitochondrial ketogenic pathway\" (MKP) to generate \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a ketone body. BHB can be generated by most cells but largely by hepatocytes following exercise, fasting, or ketogenic diet consumption. BHB has been shown to modulate systemic and brain inflammation; however, its direct effects on microglia have been little studied. We investigated the impact of BHB on A\u03b2 oligomer (A\u03b2O)-stimulated human iPS-derived microglia (hiMG), a model relevant to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). HiMG responded to A\u03b2O with proinflammatory activation, which was mitigated by BHB at physiological concentrations of 0.1-2\u2009mM. A\u03b2O stimulated glycolytic transcripts, suppressed genes in the \u03b2-oxidation pathway, and induced over-expression of AD-relevant p46Shc, an endogenous inhibitor of thiolase, actions that are expected to suppress MKP. A\u03b2O also triggered mitochondrial Ca2+ increase, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, and activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. BHB potently ameliorated all the above mitochondrial changes and rectified the MKP, resulting in reduced inflammasome activation and recovery of the phagocytotic function impaired by A\u03b2O. These results indicate that microglia MKP can be induced to modulate microglia immunometabolism, and that BHB can remedy \"keto-deficiency\" resulting from MKP suppression and shift microglia away from proinflammatory mitochondrial metabolism. These effects of BHB may contribute to the beneficial effects of ketogenic diet intervention in aged mice and in human subjects with mild AD.",

Various multi-spectroscopic techniques including XRD, LDH cytotoxicity colorimetric assay, and microscopic imaging were employed.

The amphiphilic molecule GM2 gangliosides are abundant in the human brain and play important roles in neuronal development, intercellular recognition, myelin stabilization, and signal transduction. GM2 ganglioside's degradation requires hexosaminidase A (HexA), a heterodimer composed of an \u03b1 subunit encoded by HEXA and a \u03b2 subunit encoded by HEXB. The hydrolysis of GM2 also requires a non-enzymatic protein, the GM2 activator protein (GM2-AP), encoded by GM2A. Pathogenic mutations of HEXA, HEXB, and GM2A are responsible for autosomal recessive diseases known as GM2 gangliosidosis, caused by the excessive intralysosomal accumulation of GM2 gangliosides. In AD, PD and DLB, GM2 ganglioside accumulation is reported to facilitate A\u03b2 and \u03b1-synuclein aggregation into toxic oligomers and plaques through activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as protein kinase C (PKC) and oxidative stress factors. This review explored the potential role of GM2 ganglioside alteration in toxic protein aggregations and its related signaling pathways leading to neurodegenerative diseases.

        "AbstractText": "Non-invasive methods of detecting early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) can provide valuable insight into disease pathology, improving the diagnosis and treatment of AD. Nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) MRI is a technique that provides image contrast sensitive to lipid and protein content in the brain. These macromolecules have been shown to be altered in Alzheimer's pathology, with early disruptions in cell membrane integrity and signaling pathways leading to the buildup of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. We used template-based analyzes of NOE MRI data and the characteristic Z-spectrum, with parameters optimized for increase specificity to NOE, to detect changes in lipids and proteins in an AD mouse model that recapitulates features of human AD. We find changes in NOE contrast in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, entorhinal cortex, and fimbria, with these changes likely attributed to disruptions in the phospholipid bilayer of cell membranes in both gray and white matter regions. This study suggests that NOE MRI may be a useful tool for monitoring early-stage changes in lipid-mediated metabolism in AD and other disorders with high spatial resolution.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Multi-Group Tensor Canonical Correlation Analysis.",
        "AbstractText": "Tensor Canonical Correlation Analysis (TCCA) is a commonly employed statistical method utilized to examine linear associations between two sets of tensor datasets. However, the existing TCCA models fail to adequately address the heterogeneity present in real-world tensor data, such as brain imaging data collected from diverse groups characterized by factors like sex and race. Consequently, these models may yield biased outcomes. In order to surmount this constraint, we propose a novel approach called Multi-Group TCCA (MG-TCCA), which enables the joint analysis of multiple subgroups. By incorporating a dual sparsity structure and a block coordinate ascent algorithm, our MG-TCCA method effectively addresses heterogeneity and leverages information across different groups to identify consistent signals. This novel approach facilitates the quantification of shared and individual structures, reduces data dimensionality, and enables visual exploration. To empirically validate our approach, we conduct a study focused on investigating correlations between two brain positron emission tomography (PET) modalities (AV-45 and FDG) within an Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohort. Our results demonstrate that MG-TCCA surpasses traditional TCCA in identifying sex-specific cross-modality imaging correlations. This heightened performance of MG-TCCA provides valuable insights for the characterization of multimodal imaging biomarkers in AD.",

The idea that CSF is produced and/or filtered by the choroid plexus and flows in one direction throughout the ventricular system has been a largely accepted thesis. However, modern studies have called into question the validity of this hypothesis, suggesting that\u00a0CSF does not move unidirectionally\u00a0but rather is driven by microvessel contractions in a to-and-fro manner throughout the cerebrospinal system. Moreover, new insights suggest that in addition to CSF production, the exchange of fluids and proteins between the cortical vasculature and the interstitium may function as the brain's version of a lymphatic system. This comprehensive review provides evidence for a different framework of CSF flow. One that includes perivascular pulsations that push CSF back and forth, allowing exchange between the CSF and interstitium, and with CSF production occurring throughout the cerebrospinal system. These findings could be revolutionary in understanding the pathophysiology of CSF flow\u00a0and in the treatment of pathologies such as intracranial hypertension, hydrocephalus, Alzheimer's disease, and many others.",

This study includes participants from the Three-City Study from the Bordeaux (n = 418) and Dijon (n = 422) cohorts who are free of dementia at baseline. Repeated measures of cognition over 12 years are collected. An MDMS is designed based on serum biomarkers related to MD key food groups and using a targeted metabolomics platform. Associations with CD are investigated through conditional logistic regression (matched on age, sex, and education level) in both sample sets. The MDMS is found to be inversely associated with CD (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 0.90 [0.80-1.00]; p = 0.048) in the Bordeaux (discovery) cohort. Results are comparable in the Dijon (validation) cohort, with a trend toward significance (OR [95% CI] = 0.91 [0.83-1.01]; p = 0.084).

One thousand four hundred eighty-one participants, including 724 CI and 757 controls, were enrolled in this study. Eye movement and gait, combined with dual-task patterns, were measured. The LightGBM machine learning models were constructed. A total of 105 gait and eye-tracking features were extracted. Forty-six parameters, including 32 gait and 14 eye-tracking features, showed significant differences between two groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Of these, the Gait_3Back-TurnTime and Dual-task cost-TurnTime patterns were significantly correlated with plasma phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) level.

Combining dual-task gait and dual-task eye-tracking analysis is feasible for the detection of CI. This is the first study to report the efficiency of integrated parameters of dual-task gait and eye-tracking for cognitive impairment (CI) detection in a large cohort. We identified 46 gait and eye-tracking features associated with CI, and two were correlated to plasma phosphorylated tau 181.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of tango-therapy in gait speed, functional mobility, balance, falls, ability to perform activities of daily living and quality of life. A randomised controlled trial with 31 participants living in a specialised dementia unit, aged 65 to 93\u00a0years old, who were randomly assigned to tango group (IG) or physical exercise group (CG). The primary outcome was gait speed and Timed Up and Go test. The secondary outcomes include the Short Physical Performance Battery, the ability to perform activities of daily living (Katz Index) and quality of life (Quality of life in Alzheimer Disease). Measurements were performed at baseline, and after one and three months of training. After 3\u00a0months, IG improved gait speed (p\u2009=\u20090.016), implying a statistically significant difference between groups in favour of IG (p\u2009=\u20090.003). CG significantly worsened the time to complete the TUG (p\u2009=\u20090.039). Both groups declined in their ability to perform activities of daily living, being statistically significant only in the CG (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Tango interventions showed efficacy in improving gait speed and in mitigating the decline in functional mobility and ADL skill capacities. Allowing older people with dementia access to non-pharmacological interventions may be a successful strategy to prevent functional decline. Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT05744011).",

AD is characterized pathologically by amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, with associated loss of synapses and neurons, which eventually results in dementia. Many of the early attempts to develop treatments for AD focused on A\u03b2, but a lack of efficacy of these treatments in terms of slowing disease progression led to a change of strategy towards targeting of tau pathology. Given that tau shows a stronger correlation with symptom severity than does A\u03b2, targeting of tau is more likely to be efficacious once cognitive decline begins. Anti-tau therapies initially focused on post-translational modifications, inhibition of tau aggregation and stabilization of microtubules. However, trials of many potential drugs were discontinued because of toxicity and/or lack of efficacy. Currently, the majority of tau-targeting agents in clinical trials are immunotherapies. In this Review, we provide an update on the results from the initial immunotherapy trials and an overview of new therapeutic candidates that are in clinical development, as well as considering future directions for tau-targeting therapies.",

Deep metric learning has emerged as a promising approach for addressing these challenges by improving data representation. In this study, we propose a joint triplet loss model with a semi-hard constraint (JTSC) to represent data in a small number of samples. JTSC strictly selects semi-hard samples by switching anchors and positive samples during the learning process in triplet embedding and combines a triplet loss function with an angular loss function. Our results indicate that JTSC significantly improves the number of appropriately represented samples during training when applied to the gene expression data of AD and to cancer stage prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using an embedding vector from JTSC as an input to the classifiers for AD and cancer stage prediction significantly improves classification performance by extracting more accurate features. In conclusion, we show that feature embedding through JTSC can aid in classification when there are a small number of samples compared to a larger number of features.",

Participants included a multi-ancestry cohort (European, African, and Hispanic ancestries; N\u2009=\u2009304,485; 111,494 TBI cases, 192,991 controls). TBI was assessed using MVP survey data and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes from the Veterans Health Administration's electronic health record. GWAS was performed using logistic regression in PLINK, and meta-analyzed in METAL. FUMA was used for post-GWAS analysis. Genomic structural equation modeling (gSEM) was conducted to investigate underlying genetic associations with TBI, and bivariate MiXeR was used to estimate phenotype specific and shared polygenicity. SNP-based heritability was 0.060 (SE\u2009=\u20090.004, p\u2009=\u20097.83\u00d710-66). GWAS analysis identified 15 genome-wide significant (GWS) loci at p\u2009<\u20095\u00d710-8. Gene-based analyses revealed 14 gene-wide significant genes; top genes included NCAM1, APOE, FTO, and FOXP2. Gene tissue expression analysis identified the brain as significantly enriched, particularly in the frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and nucleus accumbens. Genetic correlations with TBI were significant for risk-taking behaviors and psychiatric disorders, but generally not significant for the neurocognitive variables investigated. gSEM analysis revealed stronger associations with risk-taking traits than with psychiatric traits. Finally, the genetic architecture of TBI was similar to polygenic psychiatric disorders. Neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease showed much less polygenicity, however, the proportion of shared variance with TBI was high. This first well-powered GWAS of TBI identified 15 loci including genes relevant to TBI biology, and showed that TBI is a heritable trait with comparable genetic architecture and high genetic correlation with psychiatric traits.

However, in addition to the role of sodium benzoate as an NMDA enhancer, other mechanisms of sodium benzoate in treating AD are still unclear. To elucidate the potential mechanisms of sodium benzoate in Alzheimer's disease, this study employed label-free quantitative proteomics to analyze serum samples from AD cohorts with and without sodium benzoate treatment. The serum proteins from each patient were separated into 24 fractions using an immobilized pH gradient, digested with trypsin and then subjected to nanoLC\u2012MS/MS to analyze the proteome of all patients. The nanoLC\u2012MS/MS data were obtained with a label-free quantitative proteomic approach. Proteins with fold changes were analyzed with STRING and Cytoscape to find key protein networks/processes and hub proteins. Our analysis identified 861 and 927 protein groups in the benzoate-treatment cohort and the placebo cohort, respectively. The results demonstrated that sodium benzoate had the most significant effect on the complement and coagulation cascade pathways, amyloidosis disease, immune responses and lipid metabolic processes. Moreover, Transthyretin (TTR), Fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA), Haptoglobin (HP), Apolipoprotein B-100 (APOB), Fibrinogen beta chain (FGB), Apolipoprotein E (APOE) and Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1) were identified as hub proteins in the protein\u2012protein interaction networks.

Although their advent a few decades back, extensive exploration of various ailments or disorders began recently. The drawbacks of current chemotherapies and irradiation treatments such as drug resistance and damage to healthy tissues have enabled the rise of the peptides as quest for better prospects. The chemical tunability and smaller size make them easy to design selectively for target tissues. Other remarkable properties include antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, protection from hemorrhage stroke, and as therapeutic agents for gastric disorders, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. Despite these unmatched properties, their practical applicability is often hindered due to their weak susceptibility to enzymatic digestion, degradation in serum, metabolism in the liver, clearance by the kidney, and immunogenic reactions. There are several methods adapted in order to increase the half-life of peptides such as chemical modifications, fusing with Fc fragment, change in amino acid composition, and by using carrier-based delivery. Among these, nano-carrier-mediated encapsulation not only increases the half-life of the peptides in vivo but also it aids in the targeted delivery.

Herein, we unveiled an integrated sensor for monitoring ONOO-, which consisted of a commercially available field-effect transistor (FET) and a high-performance multi-engineered graphene extended-gate (EG) electrode. In the configuration of the presented EG electrode, laser-induced graphene (LIG) intercalated with MnO2 nanoparticles (MnO2/LIG) can improve the electrical properties of LIG and the sensitivity of the sensor, and graphene oxide (GO)-MnO2/Hemin nanozyme with ONOO- isomerase activity can selectively trigger the isomerization of ONOO- to NO3-. With this synergistic effect, our EG-FET sensor can respond to the ONOO- with high sensitivity and selectivity. Moreover, taking advantage of our EG-FET sensor, we modularly assembled a portable sensing platform for wireless tracking ONOO- levels in the brain tissue of AD transgenic mice at earlier stages before massive A\u03b2 plaques appeared, and we systematically explored the complex role of ONOO- in the occurrence and development of AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction may be involved in the increased sensitivity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients to antipsychotics, including amisulpride. Studies indicate that antipsychotics interact with facilitated glucose transporters (GLUT), including GLUT1, and that GLUT1 BBB expression decreases in AD. We tested the hypotheses that amisulpride (charge: +1) interacts with GLUT1, and that BBB transport of amisulpride is compromised in AD. GLUT1 substrates, GLUT1 inhibitors and GLUT-interacting antipsychotics were identified by literature review and their physicochemical characteristics summarised. Interactions between amisulpride and GLUT1 were studied using in silico approaches and the human cerebral endothelial cell line, hCMEC/D3. Brain distribution of [3H]amisulpride was determined using in situ perfusion in wild type (WT) and 5xFamilial AD (5xFAD) mice. With transmission electron microscopy (TEM) we investigated brain capillary degeneration in WT mice, 5xFAD mice and human samples. Western blots determined BBB transporter expression in mouse and human. Literature review revealed that, although D-glucose has no charge, charged molecules can interact with GLUT1. GLUT1 substrates are smaller (184.95\u00b16.45g/mol) than inhibitors (325.50\u00b114.40g/mol) and GLUT-interacting antipsychotics (369.38\u00b116.04). Molecular docking showed beta-D-glucose (free energy binding: -15.39kcal/mol) and amisulpride (-29.04kcal/mol) interact with GLUT1. Amisulpride did not affect [14C]D-glucose hCMEC/D3 accumulation. [3H]amisulpride uptake into the brain (except supernatant) of 5xFAD mice compared to WT remained unchanged. TEM revealed brain capillary degeneration in human AD. There was no difference in GLUT1 or P-glycoprotein BBB expression between WT and 5xFAD mice. In contrast, caudate P-glycoprotein, but not GLUT1, expression was decreased in human AD capillaries versus controls. This study provides new details about the BBB transport of amisulpride, evidence that amisulpride interacts with GLUT1 and that BBB transporter expression is altered in AD. This suggests that antipsychotics could potentially exacerbate the cerebral hypometabolism in AD. Further research into the mechanism of amisulpride transport by GLUT1 is important for improving antipsychotics safety.",

        "AbstractText": "The prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are rising globally. The role of environmental pollution in neurodegeneration is largely unknown. Thus, this perspective advocates exposome research in C. elegans models of human diseases. The models express amyloid proteins such as A\u03b2, recapitulate the degeneration of specifically vulnerable neurons and allow for correlated neurobehavioral phenotyping throughout the entire life span of the nematode. Neurobehavioral traits like locomotion gaits, rigidity, or cognitive decline are quantifiable and carefully mimic key aspects of the human diseases. Underlying molecular pathways of neurodegeneration are elucidated in pollutant-exposed C. elegans Alzheimer's or Parkinson's models by transcriptomics (RNA-seq), mass spectrometry-based proteomics and omics addressing other biochemical traits. Validation of the identified disease pathways can be achieved by genome-wide association studies in matching human cohorts. A consistent One Health approach includes isolation of nematodes from contaminated sites and their comparative investigation by imaging, neurobehavioral profiling and single worm proteomics. C. elegans models of neurodegenerative diseases are likewise well-suited for high throughput methods that provide a promising strategy to identify resilience pathways of neurosafety and keep up with the number of pollutants, nonchemical exposome factors, and their interactions.",

        "AbstractText": "This study aimed to analyze whether taurine has a nootropic effect on short-term and long-term memory in a model of sporadic dementia of the Alzheimer's type (SDAT). Moreover, we evaluated the immunoreactivity and insulin receptor (IR) distribution and markers for neurons and glial cells in the hippocampus of rats with SDAT and treated with taurine. For this, Male Wistar rats received STZ (ICV, 3\u00a0mg/kg, bilateral, 5ul per site, aCFS vehicle) and were treated with taurine (100\u00a0mg/kg orally, 1 time per day, saline vehicle) for 25 days. The animals were divided into 4 groups: vehicle (VE), taurine (TAU), ICV-STZ (STZ) and ICV-STZ plus taurine (STZ\u2009+\u2009TAU). At the end of taurine treatment, short- and long-term memory were assessed by performance on object recognition and Y-maze tasks. Insulin receptor (IR) was evaluated by immunoperoxidase while mature neurons (NeuN), astrocytes (GFAP, S100B, SOX9), and microglia (Iba-1) were evaluated by immunofluorescence. STZ induced worse spatial and recognition memory (INDEX) in YM and ORT tasks. Taurine protected against STZ-induced memory impairment. SDAT reduced the population of mature neurons as well as increased astrocytic and microglial reactivity, and taurine protected against these STZ-induced effects, mainly in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Taurine increases IR expression in the hippocampus, and protects against the reduction in the density of this receptor in CA1 induced by STZ. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that taurine is able to enhance memory, up-regulates IR in the hippocampus, protects the neuron population, and reduces the astrogliosis found in SDAT.",

        "AbstractText": "Kai-Xin-San (KXS) is a classic famous prescription composed of Polygalae Radix, Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma, and Poria. Clinically, KXS is effective in treating amnesia and regulating cognitive dysfunction of Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas its mechanism of action is still unclear. In this study, the AD model rats were established by combining intraperitoneal injection of D-galactose (150 mg/kg/day) and intracerebral injection of A\u03b225-35 (10 \u03bcL) to investigate the meliorative effect of KXS on AD and explore its mechanism. After 1-month KXS treatment, Morris water maze test showed that different doses of KXS all improved the cognitive impairment of AD rats. The results of hematoxylin and eosin staining, Nissl staining, and Tunnel staining showed that the neuron injury in the hippocampal CA1 region of the AD rats was markedly improved after KXS treatment. Concurrently, KXS reversed the levels of biochemical indexes of AD rats. Furthermore, the protein expressions of Wnt1 and \u03b2-catenin in KXS groups were remarkably increased, while the expressions of Bax and caspase-3 were significantly decreased. Besides, KXS-medicated serum reduced the levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, and reactive oxygen species and regulated the protein expressions of \u03b2-catenin, glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2), p-GSK-3\u03b2, Bax, and caspase-3 in A\u03b225-35-induced pheochromocytoma cells. Most importantly, this effect was attenuated by the Wnt inhibitor IWR-1. Our results suggest that KXS improves cognitive and memory function of AD rats, and its neuroprotective mechanism may be mediated through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.",

Traditional single-target drugs have shown limited success due to the complex interplay of pathological processes involved in AD. Multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs), designed to interact with multiple targets simultaneously, offer a more holistic approach to address the multifaceted nature of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of chalcones and huprine derivatives in mitigating amyloid-\u03b2 peptide-associated toxicity and preserving membrane integrity, crucial for cellular homeostasis. The interaction of these compounds with lipid bilayers may modulate biological responses, opening a new realm of investigation in membrane-centric phenomena.

Previous investigations have assessed the relationship between cataract, cataract surgery and dementia risk, but their results remain controversial. Herein, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the associations between cataract, cataract surgery and the risk of dementia. We systemically screened the literature from three electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL until April 2023. The data were collected by two independent researchers. The hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) from eligible studies with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adjusted into the risk ratios (RRs), which were pooled using the random-effects model. A total of nine studies with 448,140 participants reported the associations between cataract or cataract surgery and the risk of dementia were included in this meta-analysis. The outcomes of our pooled analysis indicated that cataract was associated with an increased risk of all-cause dementia (RR\u2009=\u20091.24, 95% CI, 1.14-1.35, p\u2009<\u2009.00001), Alzheimer's disease (RR\u2009=\u20091.22, 95% CI, 1.10-1.35, p\u2009=\u2009.0002) and vascular dementia (RR\u2009=\u20091.29, 95% CI, 1.01-1.66, p\u2009=\u2009.04).

        "AbstractText": "Many treatment initiatives, like herbal products and their active ingredients, aim to alleviate neurodegeneration to increase cognitive functions. Kaempferol may be a candidate molecule for treating neurodegeneration because of its antioxidant effects. In the present study, we examined the molecular changes associated with kaempferol's memory\u2011enhancing effects on streptozotocin (STZ)\u2011induced neurodegeneration. After intracerebroventricular STZ injection in Long\u2011Evans male rats, intraperitoneal kaempferol was administered for 12 days. The Morris water maze (MWM) was used to measure learning and memory performance in the rats, and proteins related to memory formation were investigated in the hippocampi with western blotting. Kaempferol improved learning performance and memory decline in STZ\u2011treated rats. At the molecular level, STZ\u2011induced neurodegeneration resulted in a decrease in the expression of GAD67, reelin, and phosphorylated\u2011NMDAR. However, kaempferol treatment ameliorated these changes by enhancing their levels similar to the controls. While neither STZ injection nor kaempferol treatment produced any significant change in phosphorylated\u2011CAMKII levels, they increased the expression of klotho and prealbumin. These results show that kaempferol has positive effects on memory loss, affecting synaptic plasticity by ameliorating both the levels and activity of memory\u2011relevant molecules through reelin signaling. In summary, this study provides a guide to future studies by examining in detail the healing effect of kaempferol as a candidate molecule in the treatment of neurodegeneration, such as that observed in Alzheimer's disease.",

This systematic review aims to summarize current understanding of the perceptions, knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about ADRD and brain health of Latinos to inform public health efforts addressing disparities. Searches were completed across six databases (Medline, PsycINFO, WoS, LILACS, ProQUEST, and CINAHL). Studies were required to capture attitudes and/or knowledge of ADRD or brain health among US-based Latino adults who were not cognitively impaired and were not caregivers or healthcare providers. Results were synthesized narratively. A total of 5528 unique records were identified. Following de-duplication and screening, 24 articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Overall, knowledge about brain health and ADRD among Latinos is quite mixed. A consistent finding was that participants recognized memory loss as a symptom of cognitive impairment, but demonstrated limited recognition of other signs of impairment. The studies also highlighted variable knowledge of protective factors for maintaining brain health. Opportunities exist to increase knowledge of ADRD signs and symptoms, and awareness of risk and protective factors. Given the heterogeneity of Latinos in the USA, more research is warranted to better elucidate nuances in conceptualizations of brain health and aging among diverse Latino subgroups.",

However, because of racial/ethnic homogeneity in prior studies focused on identifying these associations in predominantly White cohorts, less is known about the generalizability of these putative psychosocial mechanisms in a diverse population. Thus, we evaluated whether lower levels of loneliness were associated with better cognitive performance in our sample. We conducted a cross-sectional study using 541 participants from (Health and Aging in Africa: A Longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH Community in South Africa) Dementia Cohort. Participants' self-reported loneliness as exposure. Cognitive performance is measured using a neuropsychological battery as the outcome.

Better global cognitive function is associated with a lower level of loneliness at (\u03b2 = -0.0131, 95 % CI -0.1990, -0.0071) after adjustment for age, gender, and education. Lower levels of loneliness were associated with varying cognitive domains after adjustment for age, gender, and education; and persisted after additional adjustments of vascular risk factors. Self-reported lower loneliness was associated with higher levels of cognitive performance in a rural South African cohort of Black older adults. Although these findings and the potential of reverse causality need to be further validated, our results suggest that an intervention study may be merited to assess whether reducing loneliness lessens vulnerability to cognitive decline.",

It is also unclear whether specific APOE and TOMM40 genotypes contribute to heterogeneity in longitudinal cognitive performance during the preclinical stages of AD. To determine the effects of these genes on longitudinal cognitive change in early preclinical stages of AD, we used the clinical trial data from the recently concluded TOMMORROW study to examine the effects of APOE and TOMM40 genotypes on neuropsychological test performance.

Recruitment challenges for these populations limit generalizability of findings. This study explores barriers and facilitators to signing up for an AD participant recruitment registry website intended to optimize recruitment of these adults. The registry is geared toward recruitment on smartphones and tablets (mobile devices), as research suggests that mobile-first approaches may be more successful within these populations. In 2020, we conducted four focus groups (n = 39) and an online survey (n = 1010) with Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino adults. The survey also included Whites as a comparison group. Focus groups were in-person at research facilities in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Los Angeles, California. The online survey was distributed by a survey panel company to participants nationwide. Black/African American (n = 360), Hispanic/Latino (n = 359), or White (n = 330) individuals, 45-75 years old, who self-reported not having mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, or AD. Barriers and facilitators explored in the focus groups and survey were related to health and AD (e.g., AD-related concerns and past participation/willingness to participate in health or AD studies); current use of mobile devices (e.g., comfort using devices and receptivity to the AD recruitment registry); and participant characteristics and beliefs (e.g., demographics, health literacy level, and trust in government and the scientific community). The focus groups and survey revealed similar findings. Participants commonly use mobile devices to go online and perform health-related activities. They were aware of AD, expressed concerns with developing it, and were willing to participate in AD-related studies (motivated by personal connection to AD, altruism, and compensation). When presented with the AD recruitment registry, most provided positive feedback (e.g., easy to use and informative) and shared an interest in joining. Barriers to joining the registry with a mobile device included complex or multistep enrollment processes, beliefs that studies are primarily for those with a specific disease, and confusion about how studies can prevent AD among those low-risk for AD. The focus groups also revealed that Black/African American participants expressed more hesitation than Hispanic/Latinos in joining the registry due to greater distrust in the government and scientific community. Recruiting more Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino participants into AD studies is vitally important. This mixed methods study suggests that adults in these underrepresented groups are motivated to prevent AD and willing to sign up for an AD participant recruitment registry using mobile devices. Most barriers to joining a registry can be addressed through slight modifications to the registry's design and functionality and by adding content. These findings can help enhance the appeal of joining AD recruitment registries to ultimately enroll more diverse, representative groups of participants and increase the generalizability of AD study findings.",

As internet use among older adults from underrepresented populations continues to grow, internet-based research shows promise as a feasible, valid approach to engagement and longitudinal assessment. The Community Engaged Digital Alzheimer's Research (CEDAR) study utilizes a community-engaged research approach to increase the engagement and research participation of Black/African American adults in the Brain Health Registry (BHR) and Alzheimer Disease clinical research. To describe the methods and evaluate the feasibility of the CEDAR culturally-informed digital platform within BHR. All Black/African American participants in BHR were invited to enroll in CEDAR and to consider serving on a newly convened Community-Scientific Partnership Board to guide the study. The community board guided the development a culturally-informed cadre of engagement materials and strategies to increase research participation. Engagement strategies included incentives for study task completion, culturally-informed communications (e.g., landing page, emails and social media), resources about brain health, and video and written testimonials by CEDAR participants. BHR, an Internet-based registry and cohort. BHR participants self-identifying as Black/African American were invited to enroll. All participants who signed an online informed consent document were enrolled. We report the number of participants invited, enrolled, completed tasks, and volunteered to join the community board. We compared the demographics, cognitive profile, and baseline BHR task completion rates between CEDAR participants and all those invited to join the study. Of 3738 invited, 349 (9.34%) enrolled in CEDAR. 134 (37% of CEDAR participants) volunteered to join the community board, of which 19 were selected for the community board. Compared to those invited, the CEDAR cohort had a higher percentage of female participants (84.5%) and a lower percentage of participants who identify as belonging to more than one ethnocultural group (21.8%). Compared to those did not enroll in CEDAR, those enrolled in CEDAR had a higher percentage of participants completing all BHR tasks (22%) and a higher percentage of participants completing at least one cognitive test (76%). Those enrolled in CEDAR also had a higher percentage of participants having an enrolled study partner (18%). A culturally-informed Community-Engaged Research approach, including a remotely-convened community board, to engagement of Black/African American participants in an online research registry is feasible. This approach can be adapted for use in various clinical studies and other settings. Future studies will evaluate the effectiveness of the engagement strategies.",

To investigate associations among cerebral A\u03b2 burden, MDS-OA\u03b2, and WM integrity in CN. This is a single center, cross-sectional study which used data from Catholic Aging Brain Imaging (CABI) database. CABI database contains brain scans of patients who visited the outpatient clinic at Catholic Brain Health Center, Yeouido St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, between 2017 and 2022. A total 34 amyloid-PET negative CN and 23 amyloid-PET positive CN were included. Plasma A\u03b2 level using MDS-OA\u03b2, cerebral A\u03b2 deposition level using global standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) values, WM integrity using fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), and cortical thickness from structural MRI were utilized.

The MDS-OA\u03b2 positive group showed higher global cerebral A\u03b2 deposition or mean global SUVR values (0.609 \u00b1 0.135 vs. 0.533 \u00b1 0.121 vs. P <0.05), lower regional FA of left forceps minor and the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (family-wise error rate, p <0.05), and lower cortical thickness of left fusiform (p <0.05, Monte Carlo simulation) than the MDS-OA\u03b2 negative group. MDS-OA\u03b2 was positively associated with global cerebral A\u03b2 deposition (r=0.278, P <0.05) and negatively associated (r = - 0.324, P < 0.05) with regional WM integrity.

However, its association with longitudinal cognition and comparative performance to PET A\u03b2 and tau in predicting cognitive decline are unknown. To evaluate whether p217+tau can predict the rate of cognitive decline observed over two-year average follow-up and compare this to prediction based on A\u03b2 (18F-NAV4694) and tau (18F-MK6240) PET. We also explored the sample size required to detect a 30% slowing in cognitive decline in a 2-year trial and selection test cost using p217+tau (pT+) as compared to PET A\u03b2 (A+) and tau (T+) with and without p217+tau pre-screening. A prospective observational cohort study. Participants of the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) and Australian Dementia Network (ADNeT). 153 cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 50 cognitively impaired (CI) individuals.

In CI, p217+tau was a significant predictor of change in MMSE (\u03b2 = -0.55, p < 0.001) and CDR-SB (\u03b2 =0.61, p < 0.001) with an effect size similar to A\u03b2 Centiloid (MMSE \u03b2 = -0.48, p = 0.002; CDR-SB \u03b2 = 0.43, p = 0.004) and meta-temporal (MetaT) tau SUVR (MMSE: \u03b2 = -0.62, p < 0.001; CDR-SB: \u03b2 = 0.65, p < 0.001). In CU, only MetaT tau SUVR was significantly associated with change in AIBL-PACC (\u03b2 = -0.22, p = 0.008). Screening pT+ CI participants into a trial could lead to 24% reduction in sample size compared to screening with PET for A+ and 6-13% compared to screening with PET for T+ (different regions). This would translate to an 81-83% biomarker test cost-saving assuming the p217+tau test cost one-fifth of a PET scan. In a trial requiring PET A+ or T+, p217+tau pre-screening followed by PET in those who were pT+ would cost more in the CI group, compared to 26-38% biomarker test cost-saving in the CU. Substantial cost reduction can be achieved using p217+tau alone to select participants with MCI or mild dementia for a clinical trial designed to slow cognitive decline over two years, compared to participant selection by PET. In pre-clinical AD trials, p217+tau provides significant cost-saving if used as a pre-screening measure for PET A+ or T+ but in MCI/mild dementia trials this may add to cost both in testing and in the increased number of participants needed for testing.",

Whether DHA supplementation in APOE \u03b54 carriers with limited DHA consumption and dementia risk factors can delay or slow down disease progression when started before the onset of clinical dementia is not known. PreventE4 is a double-blind, single site, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in cognitively unimpaired individuals with limited omega-3 consumption and dementia risk factors (n=368). Its objectives are to determine (1) whether carrying the APOE \u03b54 allele is associated with lower delivery of DHA to the brain; and (2) whether high dose DHA supplementation affects brain imaging biomarkers of AD and cognitive function. 365 cognitively unimpaired individuals between 55 and 80 (mean age 66) were randomized to 2 grams of DHA per day or identically appearing placebo for a period of 2 years. Half the participants were asked to complete lumbar punctures at baseline and 6-month visits to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

Correction of the SAMe deficiency that is characteristic of the AD brain may attenuate or prevent pathological processes driving AD-associated neurodegeneration including aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation and DNA hypomethylation. The primary aim is to test the hypothesis that daily treatment with 400 mg oral SAMe for 180 days will lead to a greater reduction from baseline in plasma levels of p-tau181 compared to placebo in patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to AD. This is a phase II, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among 60 participants with mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to AD. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SAMe or matching placebo, to be taken as an adjunct to their AD standard of care. The primary outcome is change in plasma p-tau181 concentration between baseline and following 180 days of treatment, which will be compared between the active and placebo group. Secondary outcomes are the safety of SAMe administration (incidence of serious adverse events), change from baseline in cognitive performance (as measured by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status), and epigenetic changes in DNA methylation. Demonstration of effective and safe lowering of plasma p-tau181 with SAMe in this phase II trial would pave the way for an exciting field of translational research and a larger phase III trial.",

In this 2-phase project, input from the minority advisory board of the Cleveland Alzheimer's Disease Research Center informed development of 2 brief health communication videos which differentially focused on research barriers and facilitators (POWER) versus an education control (Phase 1). In Phase 2, a randomized prospective survey compared POWER vs. an active comparator control on pre/post video change in dementia knowledge, cumulative barriers, and facilitators to dementia research, and change in research readiness measured by the Transtheoretical behavior change model. Changes in outcomes were evaluated using two group by two time points repeated measure analysis of variance (RMANOVA) controlling for age, gender, race, and education. The pre-video sample (n=242) had mean age of 57.6 (SD17.2) years, mostly female (n=181, 74.8%), 42.6% non-white. The analyzable sample who completed both pre and post assessments comprised n=102 in the POWER and n=105 in the control group. Non-white participants made up 41.1% of the analyzable POWER (n=51) and 44.1% (n= 52) of controls. Adjusted for age, gender, race and education, controls had a greater increase in dementia knowledge (p=0.004). There was a significant reduction in barriers for POWER (p=.044) vs. control. There were no differences in research facilitators and research readiness between POWER vs. control. Among African Americans (n=59, 28.5% of the analyzable sample) there was a trend for improved dementia knowledge (p=.059) favoring control and in research readiness (p=.051), favoring POWER.

        "AbstractText": "ACD856 is a positive allosteric modulator of tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) receptors which has shown to have pro-cognitive and anti-depressant-like effects in various animal models. It is currently in clinical development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other disorders where cognition is impaired and is also considered for indications such as depression or other neuropsychiatric diseases. ACD856 has a novel mechanism of action modulating the activity of the Trk-receptors, resulting in increased stimulation of the neurotrophin signaling pathways. Previous studies applying single intravenous and oral doses of ACD856 indicate that ACD856 is safe and well-tolerated by healthy volunteer subjects, and that it has suitable safety and pharmacokinetic properties for further clinical development. To investigate the safety and tolerability of 7 days of treatment with multiple ascending oral doses of ACD856 in healthy subjects, and to characterize its pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. In addition, pharmacodynamic effects of ACD856 using quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) as an indicator for central target engagement were assessed. This was a prospective, phase I, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, randomized study of the safety, tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamics of multiple ascending oral doses of ACD856 in healthy subjects. ACD856 or placebo were administered in 3 ascending dose cohorts of 8 subjects. Within each cohort, subjects were randomized to receive either ACD856 (n=6) or placebo (n=2). The study was conducted at a First-in-Human unit in Sweden. Twenty-four healthy male and female subjects. The study medication was administered as an oral solution, with ACD856 or the same contents without the active ingredient (placebo). The dose levels ranged from 10 mg to 90 mg. ACD856 was administered once daily for 7 days, targeting steady state. Safety and tolerability assessments included adverse events, laboratory, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examination, assessment of stool frequency and questionnaires to assess symptoms of anxiety, depression, as well as suicidal ideation and behavior. In addition, cardiodynamic ECGs were extracted to evaluate cardiac safety. PK parameters were calculated based on measured concentrations of ACD856 in plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Metabolite profiling, characterization and analysis was performed based on and urine samples. qEEG was recorded for patients in the two highest dose cohorts (30 and 90 mg/day) as a pharmacodynamic assessment to explore central target engagement. Treatment with ACD856 was well tolerated with no serious adverse events. No treatment emergent or dose related trends were observed for any of the safety assessments. ACD856 was rapidly absorbed and reached maximum plasma exposure at 30 to 45 minutes after administration. Steady state was reached before Day 6, with an elimination half-life at steady state of approximately 20 hours. At steady state, ACD856 exhibited accumulation ratios for Cmax and AUC of approximately 1.6 and 1.9 respectively. The exposure, Cmax and AUC0-24, increased proportionally with the dose. There was no unchanged ACD856 detected in urine. The metabolic pattern in urine and plasma was similar, and in alignment with the metabolites observed in preclinical toxicology studies. The level of ACD856 measured in CSF at steady state increased with dose, indicating Central Nervous System (CNS) exposure at relevant levels for pharmacodynamic effects. ACD856 demonstrated significant dose-dependent treatment-associated changes on qEEG parameters. Specifically, increase of the relative theta power and decrease of the fast alpha and beta power was observed, leading to an acceleration of the delta+theta centroid and an increase in the theta/beta ratio. ACD856 was well tolerated at the tested dose levels (10-90 mg/daily for 7 days) in healthy subjects. The compound has a robust pharmacokinetic profile, with rapid absorption and dose-dependent exposure. ACD856 was shown to pass the blood-brain-barrier, reach relevant exposure in the CNS and to induce dose-dependent treatment-related changes on qEEG parameters, indicating central target engagement.",

Approval of anti-amyloid antibody therapies is a significant milestone for treatment that was enabled by the inclusion of biomarkers. The use of biomarkers in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease has enabled selective participant recruitment, improved treatment monitoring, and supported more rigorous trial designs. This review discusses emerging biomarkers associated with the biology of aging and their application in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. Aging is the primary risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease and is associated with biological processes implicated in disease development and progression. Novel therapies targeting these underlying biological aging processes are currently undergoing clinical development. Biomarkers that capture the biology of aging are integral to accelerating the development of these therapies. Current progress in biomarker development demonstrates efforts to capture the full spectrum of aging biology. Further work is needed to expand the range of biomarkers that enable comprehensive assessment of brain pathology and aid in prognosis, diagnosis, and measuring treatment response. Establishing a comprehensive arsenal of biomarkers will support strategic decision making and increase the likelihood of positive clinical trials and drug registration for the next generation of Alzheimer's disease drugs targeting the biology of aging.",

Despite the recent promising findings from anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies, a limited proportion of patients are expected to be eligible for these novel AD treatments. Given the heterogeneous nature of AD and the complex multi-level pathological processes leading to dementia (involving, e.g., shared risk factors, interaction of different pathology mechanisms, and their putative synergistic effects on cognition), targeting a single pathology may not be sufficient to halt or significantly impact disease progression. With exponentially increasing numbers of patients world-wide, in parallel to the unprecedented population ageing, new multimodal therapy approaches targeting several modifiable risk factors and disease mechanisms simultaneously are urgently required. Developing the next generation of combination therapies with lifestyle intervention and pharmacological treatments, implementing the right interventions for the right people at the right time, and defining accessible and sustainable strategies worldwide are crucial.

We also discuss some emerging underlying biological mechanisms and the current development of precision prevention approaches. We present an example of a novel trial design combining healthy lifestyle changes with a repurposed putative disease-modifying drug and place this study in the context of the World-Wide FINGERS, the first interdisciplinary network of multimodal trials dedicated to the prevention and risk reduction of cognitive impairment and dementia.",

This review seeks to summarize findings from human and non-human studies examining the association of metformin with AD/ADRD related outcomes. Studies in animal models suggest that metformin could decrease the risk of AD/ADRD through multiple mechanisms including neuroprotective effects, decreasing neuroinflammation, and decreasing AD pathology. However, there are non-human studies that suggest that metformin could increase the risk of AD/ADRD. Observational human studies are also conflicting, but those with better study designs suggest that metformin use in persons with T2D is associated with a lower risk of dementia. However, these observational studies are limited by the use of administrative data to ascertain metformin use and/or cognitive outcomes. There are few clinical trials in persons without T2D that have small sample sizes and short durations but suggest that metformin could prevent AD/ADRD. There are ongoing studies including large clinical trials with long duration that are testing the effect of metformin on AD/ADRD outcomes in persons without T2D at risk for dementia.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Targeting Endogenous Mechanisms of Brain Resilience for the Treatment and Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease.",
        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder which contributes to millions of cases of dementia worldwide. The dominant theoretical models of Alzheimer's disease propose that the brain passively succumbs to disruptions in proteostasis, neuronal dysfunction, inflammatory and other processes, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration and dementia. However, an emerging body of evidence suggests that the adult brain is endowed with endogenous mechanisms of resilience which may enable individuals to remain cognitively intact for years despite underlying pathology. In this brief review, we discuss evidence from basic neuroscience and clinical research which demonstrates the existence of endogenous molecular signaling pathways that can promote resilience to neurodegeneration. The p75 neurotrophin receptor provides one such pathway of resilience due to its role as a fundamental signaling switch which determines neuronal survival or degeneration. We highlight a series of preclinical studies targeting the p75 neurotrophin receptor in mouse models which demonstrate resilience to amyloid. We briefly discuss the design and goals of a recent clinical trial of p75 neurotrophin receptor modulation in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Unique challenges for developing therapeutics and biomarkers which are optimized for targeting and detecting endogenous mechanisms of resilience are also discussed. Altogether, this review motivates further trial work of therapeutics modulating the p75 neurotrophin receptor and other deep biology targets.",

        "AbstractText": "Neuroinflammation precedes the clinical onset of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), by years or frequently even decades (1-3). In terms of the underlying physiology, there is a great need for understanding and controlling interactions between the central nervous system (CNS) and the immune system in an attempt to develop approaches to prevent or delay the disease's progression. Nerve cells have limited motion capability, whereas immune cells can migrate freely via circulation. This difference raises a variety of questions in the context of senile plaque formation and phagocytosis. Broad-scale unbiased genomic studies bring several genetic variants such as sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin 3 (CD33), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) or complement receptor type 1 (CR1) into the focus of researchers' attention as potential risk factors for neuroinflammation. In addition, advanced proteomic analyses have been revealing links between these genetic contributors and complex, malfunctioning signaling pathways (including the upregulation of factors like tumor necrosis factor TNF-\u03b1, tumor growth factor TGF-\u03b2 and interleukin IL-1\u03b1) that promote proinflammatory mechanisms via intracellular signaling and trafficking, synaptic function, and cell metabolism/ proliferation. In AD, the brain's microglia and astrocytes, which are normally responsible for maintaining the homeostasis of synaptic transmission and its remodeling by pruning, are the initiators of neuroinflammation and toxic tau and amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation. Thus, they drive the CNS into a state of sustained or even self-accelerated deterioration. Here we aim to review the cell types and mediators involved in neuroinflammation and AD, the symptom manifestation in clinical settings, and potential candidates for improving diagnosis and treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with complex disease etiology and pathological processes. These include formation of plaques and tangles, aberrant lipid processing, neuroinflammation, cerebrovascular dysregulation, ion channel and mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Disease-modifying therapies focusing on all these different facets are needed. TW001 is an oral formulation with the radical scavenger edaravone as its active ingredient, targeting oxidative stress. This manuscript describes the trial design for Phase IIA Alzheimer Study Using oRal Edaravone (ASURE). ASURE is a randomized, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study aiming to evaluate safety and target engagement following administration of TW001 in early AD patients. Patients should have a biomarker confirmed diagnosis to be included in the trial and will be treated for 90 days. The primary endpoints include safety and effect of TW001 on oxidative stress biomarkers. Exploratory endpoints focus on a panel of AD(-related) fluid-based biomarkers and EEG. In addition, a recently developed cognitive functional composite (CFC) score will measure early signs of cognitive and functional effects of TW001. This article outlines the design of the clinical study, no results are included. The ASURE trial design is discussed, with a particular focus on fluid biomarkers, EEG, and CFC as endpoints. By testing multiple measures related to pathology, pharmacodynamics, EEG as proxy for cognition, and cognitive functional scores, it is expected that small changes will be detectable in trials of shorter duration. Moreover, the wide range of endpoints allows to make well-informed decisions for designing pivotal studies later.",

        "AbstractText": "Age remains the largest risk factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Numerous cellular hallmarks of aging contribute to the advancement of the pathologies associated with neurodegenerative disease. Not all cellular hallmarks of aging are independent and several fall into the broader category of cellular rejuvenation, which captures returning cells to a more youthful, improved functional state. Cellular rejuvenation is quickly becoming a hot topic in the development of novel therapeutic modalities for a range of diseases. Therapeutic approaches utilizing cellular rejuvenation technologies are rapidly advancing and will represent the next phase of AD therapeutics. This review focuses on two important processes, epigenetic reprogramming, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) that play a critical role in aging and in neurodegenerative diseases and the potential therapeutic approaches (gene therapy, small molecule) towards targeting these mechanisms. In aging and in AD, epigenetic changes on DNA (e.g., hypermethylation on CpG islands) lead to alterations in gene expression. Partial epigenetic reprogramming utilizes transcription factors to remove the epigenetic marks and to rejuvenate cells to a more youthful state. During aging and in neurodegenerative disorders, CMA becomes impaired resulting in a buildup of proteins known to be associated with neurodegenerative pathologies. The protein buildups lead to aggregates that preclude proteostasis leading to cell toxicity. Small-molecule CMA activators restore proteostasis and limit toxicity enabling cellular rejuvenation.",

        "AbstractText": "Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption is an early event in the development of Alzheimer's disease. It precedes extracellular deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 in senile plaques and blood vessel walls, the intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles containing phosphorylated tau protein, microglial activation, and neuronal cell death. BBB disruption allows the coagulation protein fibrinogen to leak from the blood into the brain, where it is converted by thrombin cleavage into fibrin and deposits in the parenchyma and CNS vessels. Fibrinogen cleavage by thrombin exposes a cryptic epitope termed P2 which can bind CD11b and CD11c on microglia, macrophages and dendritic cells and trigger an inflammatory response toxic to neurons. Indeed, genetic and pharmacological evidence demonstrates a causal role for fibrin in innate immune cell activation and the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The P2 inflammatory epitope is spatially and compositionally distinct from the coagulation epitope on fibrin. Mouse monoclonal antibody 5B8, which targets the P2 epitope without interfering with the clotting process, has been shown to reduce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. The selectivity and efficacy of this anti-human fibrin-P2 antibody in animal models supports the development of a monoclonal antibody drug targeting fibrin P2 for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. THN391 is a humanized, affinity-matured antibody which has a 100-fold greater affinity for fibrin P2 and improved development properties compared to the parental 5B8 antibody.

The clinical benefits achieved by reducing amyloid, though modest, provide evidence that disease modification is possible. Expanding the same tenacity to interventions targeting upstream drivers of AD pathogenesis could significantly impact the disease course. Advanced age is the greatest risk factor for developing AD. Interventions targeting biological aging offer the possibility of disrupting a foundational cause of AD. Senescent cells accumulate with age and contribute to inflammation and age-related diseases like AD. Senolytic drugs that clear senescent cells improve healthy aging, halt AD disease progression in animal models and are undergoing clinical testing. This review explores the biology of aging, the role of senescent cells in AD pathology, and various senotherapeutic approaches such as senolytics, dampening the SASP (senescence associated secretory phenotype), senescence pathway inhibition, vaccines, and prodrugs. We highlight ongoing clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the most advanced senolytic approach, dasatinib and quercetin (D+Q), including an ongoing Phase II senolytic trial supported by the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF). Challenges in the field of senotherapy for AD, including target engagement and biomarker development, are addressed. Ultimately, this research pursuit may lead to an effective treatment for AD and provide the field with another disease-modifying therapy to be used, alone or in combination, with other emerging treatment options.",

The acceptable age range for participation in AD clinical trials is 50 to 90, and this 40-year span incorporates enormous age-related change. Clinical trial participants tend to be younger and healthier than the general population. They are also younger than the general population of AD patients. Drug development from a geroscience perspective would take greater account of effects of aging on clinical trial outcomes. The AD clinical trial pipeline has diversified beyond the canonical targets of amyloid beta protein and tau. Many of these interventions apply to age-related disorders. Anti-inflammatory agents and bioenergetic and metabolic therapies are among the well represented classes in the pipeline and are applicable to AD and non-AD age-related conditions. Drug development strategies can be adjusted to better inform outcomes of trials regarding aged individuals. Inclusion of older individuals in the multiple ascending dose trials of Phase 1, use of geriatric-related clinical outcomes and biomarkers in Phase 2, and extension of these Phase 2 learnings to Phase 3 will result in a more comprehensive understanding of AD therapies and their relationship to aging. Clinical trials can employ a more comprehensive geriatric assessment approach and biomarkers more relevant to aging at baseline and as exploratory outcomes. Greater attention to the role of aging and its influence in AD clinical trials can result in better understanding of the generalizability of clinical trial findings to the older AD population.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease cortical tau pathology initiates in the layer II cell clusters of entorhinal cortex, but it is not known why these specific neurons are so vulnerable. Aging macaques exhibit the same qualitative pattern of tau pathology as humans, including initial pathology in layer II entorhinal cortex clusters, and thus can inform etiological factors driving selective vulnerability. Macaque data have already shown that susceptible neurons in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex express a \"signature of flexibility\" near glutamate synapses on spines, where cAMP-PKA magnification of calcium signaling opens nearby potassium and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels to dynamically alter synapse strength. This process is regulated by PDE4A/D, mGluR3, and calbindin, to prevent toxic calcium actions; regulatory actions that are lost with age/inflammation, leading to tau phosphorylation. The current study examined whether a similar \"signature of flexibility\" expresses in layer II entorhinal cortex, investigating the localization of PDE4D, mGluR3, and HCN1 channels. Results showed a similar pattern to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with PDE4D and mGluR3 positioned to regulate internal calcium release near glutamate synapses, and HCN1 channels concentrated on spines. As layer II entorhinal cortex stellate cells do not express calbindin, even when young, they may be particularly vulnerable to magnified calcium actions and ensuing tau pathology.",

However, there is a dearth of research on how these NPS vary across the AD continuum, especially SMC. There is also disagreement on the effects of specific NPS on each stage of the AD continuum due to their collinearity with other NPS, cognitive decline, and environmental factors (e.g., stress). In this article, we conduct a novel perspective review of the scientific literature to understand the presence of NPS across the AD continuum. Specifically, we review the effects of apathy, depression, anxiety, and stress in AD, MCI, and SMC. We then build on this knowledge by proposing two theories of NPS' occurrence across the AD continuum. Consequently, we highlight the current landscape, limitations (e.g., differing operationalization), and contentions surrounding the NPS literature.

The rising cost of medical treatment is mostly attributable to AD. There are now mainly a few slightly symptomatic therapeutic options accessible. Although this is not the primary reason, the failure to develop effective treatments for AD is often attributed to the disease's complicated pathophysiology and the wide range of underlying ideas. Studies undertaken over the past decade have aimed to find novel methods of overcoming these barriers and effectively delivering drugs to the central nervous system. As a result, nanotechnology provides a promising alternative to the standard means of administering anti-amyloidosis drugs, enhancing expectations for a successful treatment of Alzheimer's disease. These therapeutic implications of using nanoparticle-based approaches for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease are discussed in this paper. Published articles from PubMed, SciFinder, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.org, and the Alzheimer Association reports were carefully examined to compile information on the various strategies for combating AD. That has been studied to summarize the recent advancements and clinical studies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Statistics is the study and manipulation of data, including ways to gather, review, analyze, and draw conclusions from data. The biology of the BBB and its processes of penetration must be carefully taken into account while creating DDSs. If we have a better grasp of the disease's mechanism, we might be able to overcome the shortcomings of current treatments for AD. Different DDSs show interesting properties for delivering medication tailored to the brain. This review paper examines the recent applications of DDSs in diverse domains. By selecting the best targeting vectors and optimizing the combination of carriers, multifunctionalized DDS may be produced, and these DDS have a significant impact on AD therapy potential. To develop DDSs with the best therapeutic efficacy and manageable side effects, experts from a variety of fields may need to contribute their efforts. Currently, the therapeutic use of nanotechnology-based DDSs appears to be a promising prospect for AD therapy, and as the pathophysiology of AD is better understood, this strategy will develop over time.",

The prospective cohort study used data from 450,027 UK Biobank participants with snoring measured at baseline (2006 - 2010), and followed up for dementia diagnosis (censored at 2022). Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis used summary statistics for genome-wide association studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 94,437; cases = 35,274) and snoring (n = 408,317; snorers = 151,011).

The association was stronger in older individuals, APOE \u03b54 allele carriers, and during shorter follow-up periods. MR analyses suggested no causal effect of snoring on AD, however, genetic liability to AD was associated with a lower risk of snoring. Multivariable MR indicated that the effect of AD on snoring was primarily driven by BMI. The phenotypic association between snoring and lower dementia risk likely stems from reverse causation, with genetic predisposition to AD associated with reduced snoring.

We found that rG4 immunostaining strongly increased in prevalence in the hippocampus with both age and with AD severity. We further found that neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) contained rG4s, that rG4 structure can drive tau aggregation, and that rG4 formation depended on APOE genotype in the human tissue examined. Combined with previous studies showing the dependence of rG4 structure on stress and the extreme power of rG4s at oligomerizing proteins, we propose a model of neurodegeneration in which chronic rG4 formation drives proteostasis collapse.

However, the presence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) makes it challenging to identify the causal variants. To address this critical gap from association to causation, many fine mapping methods have been proposed to assign well-calibrated probabilities of causality to candidate variants, taking into account the underlying LD pattern. In this manuscript, we introduce a statistical framework that incorporates expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) information to fine mapping, built on the sum of single-effects (SuSiE) regression model. Our new method, SuSiE2, connects two SuSiE models, one for eQTL analysis and one for genetic fine mapping. This is achieved by first computing the posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) from an eQTL-based SuSiE model with the expression level of the candidate gene as the phenotype. These calculated PIPs are then utilized as prior inclusion probabilities for risk variants in another SuSiE model for the trait of interest. By leveraging eQTL information, SuSiE2 enhances the power of detecting causal SNPs while reducing false positives and the average size of credible sets by prioritizing functional variants within the candidate region. The advantages of SuSiE2 over SuSiE are demonstrated by simulations and an application to a single-cell epigenomic study for Alzheimer's disease. We also demonstrate that eQTL information can be used by SuSiE2 to compensate for the power loss because of an inaccurate LD matrix.",

Plasma p-tau217 is one of the most promising of the emerging biomarkers for AD. However, accessible methods are limited. We employed a novel p-tau217 immunoassay (UGOT p-tau217) in four independent cohorts (n=308) including a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker-classified cohort (Discovery), two cohorts consisting mostly of cognitively unimpaired participants (MYHAT and Pittsburgh), and a population-based cohort of individuals with SCD (\u03b2-AARC). UGOT p-tau217 showed high accuracy (AUC= 0.80-0.91) identifying A\u03b2 pathology, determined either by A\u03b2 positron emission tomography or CSF A\u03b242/40 ratio. In individuals experiencing SCD, UGOT p-tau217 showed high accuracy identifying those with a positive CSF A\u03b242/40 ratio (AUC= 0.91). UGOT p-tau217 can be an easily accessible and efficient way to screen and monitor patients with suspected AD pathophysiology, even in the early stages of the continuum.",

Complement-mediated synaptic pruning has been associated with this excessive loss of synapses in AD. Here, we investigated the effect of C5aR1 inhibition on microglial and astroglial synaptic pruning in two mouse models of AD. A combination of super-resolution and confocal and tridimensional image reconstruction was used to assess the effect of genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of C5aR1 on the Arctic48 and Tg2576 models of AD. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of C5aR1 rescues the excessive pre-synaptic pruning and synaptic loss in an age and region dependent fashion in two mouse models of AD, which correlates with improved long-term potentiation (LTP). Reduction of excessive synaptic pruning is an additional beneficial outcome of the suppression of C5a-C5aR1 signaling, further supporting its potential as an effective targeted therapy to treat AD.",

However, how genetic risk factors for these diseases are related to microglial gene expression, microglial function, and ultimately disease, is still largely unknown. Microglia change rapidly in response to alterations in their cellular environment, which is regulated through changes in transcriptional programs, which are as yet poorly understood. Here, we compared the effects of a set of inflammatory and restorative stimuli (lipopolysaccharide, interferon-gamma, resiquimod, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, adenosine triphosphate, dexamethasone, and interleukin-4) on human microglial cells from 67 different donors (N = 398 samples) at the gene and transcript level. We show that microglia from different anatomical brain regions show distinct responses to inflammatory stimuli. We observed a greater overlap between human stimulated microglia and human monocytes than with mouse microglia. We define specific microglial signatures across conditions which are highly relevant for a wide range of biological functions and complex human diseases. Finally, we used our stimulation signatures to interpret associations from Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic studies and microglia by integrating our inflammatory gene expression profiles with common genetic variants to map cis -expression QTLs (eQTLs).

        "AbstractText": "Type-2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) ion channels facilitate the release of Ca 2+ from stores and serve an important function in neuroplasticity. The role for RyR2 in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory is well established and chronic hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 (RyR2P) is associated with pathological calcium leakage and cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. By comparison, little is known about the role of RyR2 in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) circuitry important for working memory, decision making, and reward seeking. Here, we evaluated the basal expression and localization of RyR2 and RyR2P in the vmPFC. Next, we employed an operant model of sucrose, cocaine, or morphine self-administration (SA) followed by a (reward-free) recall test, to reengage vmPFC neurons and reactivate reward-seeking and re-evaluated the expression and localization of RyR2 and RyR2P in vmPFC. Under basal conditions, RyR2 was expressed in pyramidal cells but not regularly detected in PV/SST interneurons. On the contrary, RyR2P was rarely observed in PFC somata and was restricted to a different subcompartment of the same neuron - the apical dendrites of layer-5 pyramidal cells. Chronic SA of drug (cocaine or morphine) and nondrug (sucrose) rewards produced comparable increases in RyR2 protein expression. However, recalling either drug reward impaired the usual localization of RyR2P in dendrites and markedly increased its expression in somata immunoreactive for Fos, a marker of highly activated neurons. These effects could not be explained by chronic stress or drug withdrawal and instead appeared to require a recall experience associated with prior drug SA. In addition to showing the differential distribution of RyR2/RyR2P and affirming the general role of vmPFC in reward learning, this study provides information on the propensity of addictive drugs to redistribute RyR2P ion channels in a neuronal population engaged in drug-seeking. Hence, focusing on the early impact of addictive drugs on RyR2 function may serve as a promising approach to finding a treatment for substance use disorders.",

We aim to test the hypothesis that AD patients can be categorized into subgroups based on differences in progression. We leveraged data from three randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to develop a knowledge-guided, deep temporal clustering (KG-DTC) framework for AD subtyping. This model combined autoencoders for contextual information capture, k-means clustering for representation formation, and clinical outcome classification for clinical knowledge integration. The derived representations, encompassing demographics, APOE genotype, cognitive assessments, brain volumes, and biomarkers, were clustered using the Gaussian Mixture Model to identify AD subtypes. Our novel KG-DTC framework was developed using placebo data from 2,087 AD patients across three solanezumab clinical trials (EXPEDITION, EXPEDITION2, and EXPEDITION3), achieving high performance in outcome prediction and clustering. The KG-DTC model demonstrated superior clustering structures, especially when combined with k-means clustering loss. External validation with independent clinical trial data showed consistent clustering results, with a 0.33 silhouette score for three clusters. The model's stability was confirmed through a leave-one-out approach, with an average adjusted Rand Index around 0.945. Three distinct AD subtypes were identified, each exhibiting unique patterns of cognitive function, neurodegeneration, and amyloid beta levels. Notably, Subtype 3 (S3) showed rapid cognitive decline across multiple clinical measures (e.g., 0.64 in S1 vs. -1.06 in S2 vs. 15.09 in S3 of average ADAS total change score, p<.001).

While apoE is primarily expressed by astrocytes, AD pathology including endosomal abnormalities and mitochondrial dysfunction first occurs in neurons. Lysosomes are poised at the convergence point between these features. We find that apoE4-expressing cells exhibit lysosomal alkalinization, reduced lysosomal proteolysis, and impaired mitophagy. To identify driving factors for this lysosomal dysfunction, we performed quantitative lysosomal proteome profiling. This revealed that apoE4 expression results in lysosomal depletion of Lgals3bp and accumulation of Tmed5 in both Neuro-2a cells and postmitotic human neurons. Modulating the expression of both proteins affected lysosomal function, with Tmed5 knockdown rescuing lysosomal alkalinization in apoE4 cells, and Lgals3bp knockdown causing lysosomal alkalinization and reduced lysosomal density in apoE3 cells. Taken together, our work reveals that apoE4 exerts gain-of-toxicity by alkalinizing the lysosomal lumen, pinpointing lysosomal Tmed5 accumulation and Lgals3bp depletion as apoE4-associated drivers for this phenotype.",

In particular, aberrant cytoskeletal structures such as cofilin-actin rods and stress granules formed in response to energetic and oxidative stress are closely linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS. Whether these cytoskeletal phenomena can be harnessed for the development of biosensors for cytoskeletal dysfunction and, by extension, neurodegenerative disease progression, remains an open question. In this work, we describe the design and development of an optogenetic iteration of profilin, an actin monomer binding protein with critical functions in cytoskeletal dynamics. We demonstrate that this optically activated profilin ('OptoProfilin') can act as an optically triggered biosensor of applied cellular stress in select immortalized cell lines. Notably, OptoProfilin is a single component biosensor, likely increasing its utility for experimentalists. While a large body of work closely links profilin activity with cellular stress and neurodegenerative disease, this, to our knowledge, is the first example of profilin as an optogenetic biosensor of stress-induced changes in the cytoskeleton.",

Early diagnosing PD is challenging as it evolved slowly, and its symptoms eventuate gradually. Recent studies have demonstrated that changes in speech may be utilized as an excellent biomarker for the early diagnosis of PD. In this study, we have proposed a Chirplet transform (CT) based novel approach for diagnosing PD using speech signals. We employed CT to get the time-frequency matrix (TFM) of each speech recording, and we extracted time-frequency based entropy (TFE) features from the TFM. The statistical analysis demonstrates that the TFE features reflect the changes in speech that occurs in the speech due to PD, hence can be used for classifying the PD and healthy control (HC) individuals. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated using the vowels and words from the PC-GITA database. The genetic algorithm is utilized to select the optimum features subset, while a support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) classifiers are employed for classification. The TFE features outperform the breathiness and Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features. The SVM classifier is most effective compared to other machine-learning classifiers. The highest classification accuracy rates of 98% and 99% are achieved using the vowel /a/ and word /atleta/, respectively. The results reveal that the proposed CT-based entropy features effectively diagnose PD using the speech of a person.",

        "AbstractText": "Frontal, temporal lobe dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are fatal neurodegenerative diseases. Studies have found that CCNF mutations have been found in patients with familial and sporadic ALS and FTD. Behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is a clinical syndrome characterized by progressive deterioration of personality, social behaviour, and cognitive function, which is most closely related to genetic factors. As the early symptoms of bvFTD are highly heterogeneous, the condition is often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease or psychiatric disorders. In this study, a bvFTD patient had a CCNF gene mutation, which led to ubiquitinated protein accumulation and ultimately caused neurodegenerative disease. Genetic detection should be improved urgently for bvFTD patients and family members to provide a clinical reference for early diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. In this case, the patient was 65 years old with an insidious onset, early-onset memory loss, a significant decline in the episodic memory, an early AD diagnosis, and oral treatment with donepezil hydrochloride for 3 years with poor efficacy, followed by a change to oral memantine hydrochloride tablets, which controlled the condition for several months. His medication was switched to sodium oligomannate capsules, and his condition was gradually controlled, but no significant improvement was observed. After spontaneous drug withdrawal, the patient's condition progressed rapidly; therefore, he visited our hospital and underwent neuropsychological tests for moderate to severe cognitive impairment. AD cerebrospinal fluid markers showed no significant abnormalities, and cranial MRI revealed frontotemporal lobe atrophy and decreased hippocampal volume. Genetic testing for the presence of the CCNF gene revealed a c.1532C > A (p. T511N) heterozygous variant, which might be a diagnostic criterion for bvFTD. Therefore, the patient's symptoms recurred after transient improvement with the combination of donepezil, oral memantine hydrochloride tablets, and sodium oligomannate, but his overall condition was improved compared to that before, and this treatment regimen was continued to observe changes during the follow-up. The early clinical manifestations of bvFTD are complex and variable, and the condition is easily misdiagnosed, thus delaying treatment. Therefore, for patients with a high clinical suspicion of FTD, in addition to a detailed understanding of their medical history and family history and improvement of relevant examinations, genetic testing should be performed as early as possible to help confirm the diagnosis. For diseases closely related to genes, genetic testing of other family members should be optimised as much as possible to allow early diagnosis and intervention and guide fertility in the next generation.",

In fact, the earliest abnormality associated with the disease is the presence of phosphorylated tau protein in locus coeruleus neurons, a brain structure highly responsive to stress and perceived threat. Here, we introduce allostatic load as a useful concept for understanding many of the complex, interacting neuropathological changes involved in the AD degenerative process. In response to chronic stress, aberrant tau proteins that begin to accumulate within the locus coeruleus decades prior to symptom onset appear to represent a primary pathological event in the AD cascade, triggering a wide range of interacting brain changes involving neuronal excitotoxicity, endocrine alterations, inflammation, oxidative stress, and amyloid plaque exacerbation. While it is acknowledged that stress will not necessarily be the major precipitating factor in all cases, early tau-induced changes within the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine pathway suggests that a therapeutic window might exist for preventative measures aimed at managing stress and restoring balance within the HPA axis.",

These regions harbour nearly 2000 potential novel genes with unknown function. In order to uncover candidate genes associated with human neurological pathologies, a comparative transcriptome study using the T2T-CHM13 and the GRCh38 genome assemblies was conducted on previously published datasets for eight distinct human neurological disorders. The analysis of differential expression in RNA sequencing data led to the identification of 336 novel candidate genes linked to human neurological disorders. Additionally, it was revealed that, on average, 3.6% of the differentially expressed genes detected with the GRCh38 assembly may represent potential false positives. Among the noteworthy findings, two novel genes were discovered, one encoding a pore-structured protein and the other a highly ordered \u03b2-strand-rich protein. These genes exhibited upregulation in multiple epilepsy datasets and hold promise as candidate genes potentially modulating the progression of the disease. Furthermore, an analysis of RNA derived from white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis patients indicated significant upregulation of 26 rRNA encoding genes.

These subjects were assigned to multimodal magnetic resonance imaging scanning before and after a 4-week stimulation. Then, we investigated the neural mechanism underlying rTMS treatment based on static functional network connectivity (sFNC) and dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) analyses. Finally, the support vector regression was used to predict the individual rTMS treatment response through these functional features at baseline. We found that rTMS at the left angular gyrus significantly induced cognitive improvement in multiple cognitive domains. Participants after rTMS treatment exhibited significantly the increased sFNC between the right frontoparietal network (rFPN) and left frontoparietal network (lFPN) and decreased sFNC between posterior visual network and medial visual network. We revealed remarkable dFNC characteristics of brain connectivity, which was increased mainly in higher-order cognitive networks and decreased in primary networks or between primary networks and higher-order cognitive networks. dFNC characteristics in state 1 and state 4 could further predict individual higher memory improvement after rTMS treatment (state 1, R\u2009=\u20090.58; state 4, R\u2009=\u20090.54).

This emerging and rapidly growing field has improved our understanding of disease aetiology and contributed to advances in precision medicine. As the field continues to develop, metabolomic epidemiology could lead to the discovery of diagnostic biomarkers predictive of disease risk, aiding in earlier disease detection and better prognosis. In this Review, we discuss key advances facilitated by the field of metabolomic epidemiology for a range of conditions, including cardiometabolic diseases, cancer, Alzheimer's disease and COVID-19, with a focus on potential clinical utility. Core principles in metabolomic epidemiology, including study design, causal inference methods and multi-omic integration, are briefly discussed. Future directions required for clinical translation of metabolomic epidemiology findings are summarized, emphasizing public health implications. Further work is needed to establish which metabolites reproducibly improve clinical risk prediction in diverse populations and are causally related to disease progression.",

        "AbstractText": "The selective inhibition of kinases from the diabetic kinome is known to promote the regeneration of beta cells and provide an opportunity for the curative treatment of diabetes. The effect can be achieved by carefully tailoring the selectivity of inhibitor toward a particular kinase, especially DYRK1A, previously associated with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. Recently DYRK1A inhibition has been shown to promote both insulin secretion and beta cells proliferation. Here, we show that commonly available flavones are effective inhibitors of DYRK1A. The observed biochemical activity of flavone compounds is confirmed by crystal structures solved at 2.06\u00a0\u00c5 and 2.32\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, deciphering the way inhibitors bind in the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase, which is driven by the arrangement of hydroxyl moieties. We also demonstrate antidiabetic properties of these biomolecules and prove that they could be further improved by therapy combined with TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors. Our data will allow future structure-based optimization of the presented scaffolds toward potent, bioavailable and selective anti-diabetic drugs.",

Routine neuropathologic examination was performed at the time of autopsy. Cerebrovascular disease severity was evaluated using modified Kalaria and Strozyk scales. Clinical dementia diagnoses were manually collected from patients' medical records. Prior to death, 15 (47%) RA patients and 14 (44%) controls were diagnosed with dementia; 9 patients in each group (60% and 64%, respectively) had Alzheimer's disease. The prevalence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, microinfarcts, infarcts or strokes was found to be similar between groups. Patients with RA were more likely to have more severe vascular changes in the basal ganglia by Kalaria scale (P\u2009=\u20090.04), but not in other brain areas. There were no significant differences in the presence of large infarcts, lacunar infarcts or leukoencephalopathy by Strozyk scale. Among patients with RA and no clinical diagnosis of dementia, the majority had mild-moderate cerebrovascular abnormalities, and a subset of patients had Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes. In this small series of autopsies, patients with and without RA had largely similar cerebrovascular pathology when controlling for neurodegenerative proteinopathies, although patients with RA exhibited more pronounced cerebrovascular disease in the basal ganglia.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia and is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration leading to severe cognitive, memory, and behavioral impairments. The onset of AD involves a complex interplay among various factors, including age, genetics, chronic inflammation, and impaired energy metabolism. Despite significant efforts, there are currently no effective therapies capable of modifying the course of AD, likely owing to an excessive focus on the amyloid hypothesis and a limited consideration of other intracellular pathways. In the present review, we emphasize the emerging concept of AD as a metabolic disease, where alterations in energy metabolism play a critical role in its development and progression. Notably, glucose metabolism impairment is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, Ca2+ dyshomeostasis, and protein misfolding, forming interconnected processes that perpetuate a detrimental self-feeding loop sustaining AD progression. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), neurotoxic compounds that accumulate in AD, are considered an important consequence of glucose metabolism disruption, and glyceraldehyde (GA), a glycolytic intermediate, is a key contributor to AGEs formation in both neurons and astrocytes. Exploring the impact of GA-induced glucose metabolism impairment opens up exciting possibilities for creating an easy-to-handle in vitro model that recapitulates the early stage of the disease. This model holds great potential for advancing the development of novel therapeutics targeting various intracellular pathways implicated in AD pathogenesis. In conclusion, looking beyond the conventional amyloid hypothesis could lead researchers to discover promising targets for intervention, offering the possibility of addressing the existing medical gaps in AD treatment.",

Short bursts of high-frequency oscillations, so called sharp-wave-ripples, have been proposed as a potential mechanism for this information transfer: They can synchronize neural activity to support the formation of local neural networks to store information, and between distant cortical sites to act as a bridge to transfer information between sensory cortical areas and hippocampus. In neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's Disease, different neuropathological processes impair normal neural functioning and neural synchronization as well as sharp-wave-ripples, which impairs consolidation and retrieval of information, and compromises memory. Here, we formulate a new hypothesis, that artificially inducing sharp-wave-ripples with noninvasive high-frequency visual stimulation could potentially support memory functioning, as well as target the neuropathological processes underlying neurodegenerative diseases. We also outline key challenges for empirical tests of the hypothesis.",

The PI3K/NRF2 pathway has particular importance in increasing the expression of antioxidants. Thus present study aimed to investigate the effect of eight weeks of aerobic training (AT) with vitamin C (VC) on the expression pathway of antioxidants in the hippocampus tissue of trimethyltin chloride (TMT) induced Alzheimer's Disease Rats. In this experimental study, 28 male Sprague-Dawley rats (age 14-16\u00a0months, weight 270-320\u00a0g) were injected 10\u00a0mg/kg TMT and were divided into (1) TMT (n\u00a0=\u00a07), (2) TMT\u00a0+\u00a0VC (n\u00a0=\u00a07), (3) TMT\u00a0+\u00a0AT (n\u00a0=\u00a07) and (4) TMT\u00a0+\u00a0VC\u00a0+\u00a0AT (n\u00a0=\u00a07) groups. Also, 7 healthy rats without any intervention selected as healthy control (HC) group to investigate the effects of TMT on research variables. Groups 3 and 4 ran on the treadmill for eight weeks, for 15-48\u00a0min at a speed of 10-24\u00a0m/min. Also, groups 2 and 4 received 4\u00a0mg/kg VC orally. To measure PI3K, Nrf2, SOD and catalase in the hippocampus tissue of rats, ELISA method were used. To analyze the data, one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post- hoc tests were used (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). The hippocampal values of Nrf2 and SOD in TMT\u00a0+\u00a0VC, TMT\u00a0+\u00a0AT and TMT\u00a0+\u00a0VC\u00a0+\u00a0AT groups were higher than TMT group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Catalase in TMT\u00a0+\u00a0AT and TMT\u00a0+\u00a0VC\u00a0+\u00a0AT groups was higher than TMT group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Also, catalase and PI3K were higher in the TMT\u00a0+\u00a0VC\u00a0+\u00a0AT group than the TMT\u00a0+\u00a0VC group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.05). PI3K levels of TMT\u00a0+\u00a0VC\u00a0+\u00a0AT group were higher than TMT\u00a0+\u00a0AT group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). It seems that AT and VC, both alone and in combination, play a role in improving the transcription pathway of antioxidants in the hippocampus tissue of TMT induced Alzheimer's disease Rats. Therefore, the combination of these two interventions is suggested to improve the antioxidant system.",

In this study, we examined the in vitro anti-amyloidogenic activity of the isoindolinone derivative 3-(3-oxoisoindolin-1-yl)pentane-2,4-dione (ISOAC1) and its neuroprotective potential against the A\u03b21-42 toxicity. By performing the Thioflavin T fluorescence assay, Western blotting analyses, and Circular Dichroism experiments, we found that ISOAC1 was able to reduce the A\u03b21-42 aggregation and conformational transition towards \u03b2-sheet structures. Interestingly, in silico studies revealed that ISOAC1 was able to bind to both the monomer and a pentameric protofibril of A\u03b21-42, establishing a hydrophobic interaction with the PHE19 residue of the A\u03b21-42 KLVFF motif. In vitro analyses on primary cortical neurons showed that ISOAC1 counteracted the increase of intracellular Ca2+ levels and decreased the A\u03b21-42-induced toxicity, in terms of mitochondrial activity reduction and increase of reactive oxygen species production. In addition, confocal microscopy analyses showed that ISOAC1 was able to reduce the A\u03b21-42 intraneuronal accumulation. Collectively, our results clearly show that ISOAC1 exerts a neuroprotective effect by reducing the A\u03b21-42 aggregation and toxicity, hence emerging as a promising compound for the development of new A\u03b2-targeting therapeutic strategies for AD treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) share common features, including insulin resistance. Brain insulin resistance has been implicated as a key factor in the pathogenesis of AD. Recent studies have demonstrated that anti-diabetic drugs sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2-i) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4-i) improve insulin sensitivity and provide neuroprotection. However, the effects of these two inhibitors on the brain metabolism and insulin resistance remain uninvestigated. We developed a T2D-AD mouse model using a high-fat diet (HFD) for 19 weeks along with a single dose of streptozotocin (100\u00a0mg/kg, intraperitoneally) at the fourth week of HFD initiation. Subsequently, the animals were treated with SGLT2-i (empagliflozin, 25\u00a0mg/kg/day orally [p.o.]) and DPP4-i (sitagliptin, 100\u00a0mg/kg/day p.o.) for 7 weeks. Subsequently, behavioral tests were performed, and the expression of insulin signaling, AD-related, and other signaling pathway proteins in the brain were examined. T2D-AD mice not only showed increased blood glucose levels and body weight but also insulin resistance. SGLT2-i and DPP4-i effectively ameliorated insulin sensitivity and reduced body weight in these mice. Furthermore, SGLT2-i and DPP4-i significantly improved hippocampal-dependent learning, memory, and cognitive functions in the T2D-AD mouse model. Interestingly, SGLT2-i and DPP4-i reduced the hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) levels and amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation and enhanced brain insulin signaling. SGLT2-i reduced pTau accumulation through the angiotensin converting enzyme-2/angiotensin (1-7)/ mitochondrial assembly receptor axis, whereas DPP4-i reduced A\u03b2 accumulation by increasing insulin-degrading enzyme levels. These findings suggest that SGLT2-i and DPP4-i prevent AD-like pathology and cognitive dysfunction in T2D mice potentially through affecting brain insulin signaling via different mechanisms.",

Diagnosis in its early and even preclinical stages will be beneficial for its prevention and treatment. In the accepted pathological theory, abnormal accumulation of A\u03b2 protein and abnormal mitochondrial function, including changes in mitochondrial viscosity, is closely related to Alzheimer's disease. To date, rare fluorescent probes have been reported that can simultaneously image A\u03b2 plaques and mitochondrial viscosity. Therefore, the development of a dual-functional fluorescent probe for real-time fluorescence imaging of A\u03b2 plaques and mitochondrial viscosity is crucial to discover a novel approach and strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and to understand the pathological process and crosstalk between different biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.

Among them, QM-SF-2 exhibited excellent properties such as large Stokes shift (168\u00a0nm), near-infrared emission (689\u00a0nm), and high selectivity and sensitivity (limit of detection was 1.07\u00a0\u03bcM) to A\u03b2 aggregate and mitochondrial viscosity changes, indicating its promising prospects as a dual-functional imaging tool in the pathological study of Alzheimer's disease.",

Dementia friendly communities have been shown to reduce stigma, and the gap in health and social outcomes for people impacted by dementia. Despite the large presence of established dementia friendly communities, their functioning in multicultural communities remains underexplored. The aim of this review was to identify the barriers and facilitators of cultural inclusivity to inform the development of a multicultural dementia friendly community. We systematically searched for academic and grey literature regarding existing and prospective age or dementia-friendly communities that engaged with culturally and linguistically diverse communities. Using the matrix method, data on the barriers and facilitators to engagement were extracted. Papers were analysed for common themes and findings were integrated in a narrative format. A total of 3,164 papers were identified, 11 of which met inclusion criteria. There were 6 dementia friendly communities in North America, 3 in Europe, 1 in Australia and 1 in Asia. Analyses revealed that barriers to cultural inclusivity were centered around the accessibility of services, sociocultural factors, and the environment, including issues such as low awareness of dementia and stigma, language barriers, isolation, and the inaccessibility of transport and buildings. Leveraging existing cultural leaders and social structures to target culturally and linguistically diverse populations and develop tailored dementia friendly initiatives were key facilitators. To foster cultural inclusivity in dementia friendly communities, a culturally specific lens that addresses these barriers and utilises facilitators must be applied from the design stage through to implementation and evaluation.",

We addressed the question whether a deficit in episodic thinking can be picked up directly from connected speech and its detection can be automatized. We linguistically classified 2,809 utterances (including embedded clauses in the utterances) from picture descriptions from 70 healthy older controls, 82 people with mild probable AD (pAD), and 46 people with moderate pAD for whether they were episodic, nonepisodic, or \"other\" (e.g., off-task). Generalized linear regression models were used to investigate how ratios of these categories change in AD, controlling for age, gender, and education. Finally, we applied deep learning technique to explore the feasibility of automating the episodicity analysis. Decline in episodicity significantly distinguished controls from both mild pAD and moderate pAD. Correlation analysis suggested this decline not to be an effect of age, gender, and education but of cognitive ability. The decline was not compensated by an increase of nonepisodic utterances but mainly of off-task expressions. A transformer-based classifier to explore the possibility of automatizing the classification of episodicity achieved a macro F1 score of 0.913 in the ternary classification. These results show that a loss of episodicity is an early effect in AD that is manifested in spontaneous speech and can be reliably measured by both humans and machines.",

When stratified by cause and severity, exogenous thyrotoxicosis remained a significant risk factor (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.10-1.63; P\u2009=\u2009.003) with point estimates suggestive of a dose response. In this cohort study among patients 65 years and older, a low TSH level from either endogenous or exogenous thyrotoxicosis was associated with higher risk of incident cognitive disorder. Iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis is a common result of thyroid hormone therapy. With thyroid hormone among the most common prescriptions in the US, understanding the negative effects of overtreatment is critical to help guide prescribing practice.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Association between aspirin use and risk of dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "AbstractText": "Dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pose significant challenges to public health globally with no effective treatment strategies available.\u00a0Therefore, the research focuses on developing effective prophylaxis to prevent the onset of these diseases. Recent studies have suggested that low-dose aspirin may help reduce the risk of dementia. Nonetheless, evidence regarding the correlation between aspirin consumption and the onset of dementia and AD is limited. This review aims to provide an up-to-date summary of the existing evidence and evaluate the association between aspirin and the onset of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases was conducted to find eligible studies published until April 2023. A random-effects meta-analysis of the eligible studies was then performed to assess the link between aspirin use and the onset of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, we conducted subgroup analyses to evaluate the overall effect of low-dose (75-100\u00a0mg) aspirin consumption on the onset of dementia and AD. A total of 875 studies were identified, with only 22 meeting the inclusion criteria. There was no statistically significant impact of aspirin consumption on the onset of dementia (HR 1.13, 11 studies) or Alzheimer's disease (HR 0.91, 3 studies). Additionally, subgroup analysis showed that taking low doses of aspirin (75-100\u00a0mg) did not significantly affect the onset of either dementia (HR 0.96, 13 studies) or Alzheimer's disease (HR 0.85, 2 studies). Aspirin use does not decrease the risk of dementia or AD, even when taken in low doses. However, the quality of the studies analyzed was inadequate, with only three randomized controlled trials included in the review. Future high-quality studies are needed to assess the effect of aspirin consumption on these diseases. These findings may assist clinicians in selecting appropriate prophylactic strategies for patients at risk of developing dementia and AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and is characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive abilities. A pathological hallmark of AD is a region-specific accumulation of the amyloid-beta protein (A\u03b2). Here, we explored the association between regional A\u03b2 deposition, sociodemographic, and local biochemical factors. We quantified the A\u03b2 burden in postmortem cortical samples from parietal (PCx) and temporal (TCx) regions of 27 cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 15 AD donors, aged 78-100\u2009+\u2009years. Histological images of A\u03b2 immunohistochemistry and local concentrations of pathological and inflammatory proteins were obtained at the \"Aging, Dementia and TBI Study\" open database. We used the area fraction fractionator stereological methodology to quantify the A\u03b2 burden in the gray and white matter within each cortical region. We found higher A\u03b2 burdens in the TCx of AD octogenarians compared to CU ones. We also found higher A\u03b2 loads in the PCx of AD nonagenarians than in AD octogenarians. Moreover, AD women exhibited increased A\u03b2 deposition compared to CU women. Interestingly, we observed a negative correlation between education years and A\u03b2 burden in the white matter of both cortices in CU samples. In AD brains, the A\u03b240, A\u03b242, and pTau181 isoforms of A\u03b2 and Tau proteins were positively correlated with the A\u03b2 burden. Additionally, in the TCx of AD donors, the proinflammatory cytokine TNF\u03b1 showed a positive correlation with the A\u03b2 load. These novel findings contribute to understanding the interplay between sociodemographic characteristics, local inflammatory signaling, and the development of AD-related pathology in the cerebral cortex.",

Retrospective large database review. The prevalence of OSA is as high as 75% in patients with T21. We sought to examine the cardiovascular, neurological, and endocrinological outcomes of patients with T21 10 years after their diagnosis of OSA. TriNetX, an electronic medical record database, was queried for health outcomes in patients with T21 after diagnosis of OSA. The group was further analyzed to identify those who underwent sleep surgery, including hypoglossal nerve stimulation, palatopharyngoplasty, or adenotonsillectomy. Ten years after diagnosis, patients with OSA and T21 had a significantly higher incidence of death, myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, essential hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and Alzheimer's disease compared to patients with T21 alone. Patients with OSA and T21 who underwent sleep surgery had significantly reduced incidence of adverse health outcomes compared to patients using continuous positive airway pressure. Our findings suggest that patients with T21 and OSA are at higher risk of poor health outcomes, which may require closer monitoring for earlier diagnosis and management of comorbid conditions. Sleep surgery is a suitable treatment modality for mitigating the risk of adverse outcomes in this population and should be considered in patients who are eligible surgical candidates.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Recent development in sciences has also identified the pivotal role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in AD pathogenesis. We proposed a novel method to identify AD pathway-specific statistically significant miRNAs from the targets of known AD drugs. Moreover, microRNA scaffolds and corresponding drug scaffolds of different pathways were also discovered. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to identify pathway-specific significant miRNAs. We generated feed-forward loop regulations of microRNA-TF-gene-based networks, studied the minimum free energy structures of pre-microRNA sequences, and clustered those microRNAs with their corresponding structural motifs of robust transcription factors. Conservation analyses of significant microRNAs were done, and the phylogenetic trees were constructed. We identified 3'UTR binding sites and chromosome locations of these significant microRNAs. In this study, hsa-miR-4261, hsa-miR-153-5p, hsa-miR-6766, and hsa-miR-4319 were identified as key miRNAs for the ACHE pathway and hsa-miR-326, hsa-miR-6133, hsa-miR-4251, hsa-miR-3148, hsa-miR-10527-5p, hsa-miR-527, and hsa-miR-518a were identified as regulatory miRNAs for the NMDA pathway. These miRNAs were regulated by several AD-specific TFs, namely RAD21, FOXA1, and ESR1. It has been observed that anisole and adamantane are important chemical scaffolds to regulate these significant miRNAs. This is the first study that developed a detailed correlation between known AD drug scaffolds and their AD target-specific miRNA scaffolds. This study identified chromosomal locations of microRNAs and corresponding structural scaffolds of transcription factors that may be responsible for miRNA co-regulation for Alzheimer's disease.

Despite promising efficacy observed in some clinical trials, the full range of biological effects and mechanism(s) of action of these compounds have yet to be fully established. Indeed, most studies to date have focused on assessing the psychological mechanisms of psychedelics, often neglecting the non-psychological modes of action. However, it is important to understand that psychedelics may mediate their therapeutic effects through multi-faceted mechanisms, such as the modulation of brain network activity, neuronal plasticity, neuroendocrine function, glial cell regulation, epigenetic processes, and the gut-brain axis. This review provides a framework supporting the implementation of a multi-faceted approach, incorporating in silico, in vitro and in vivo modeling, to aid in the comprehensive understanding of the physiological effects of psychedelics and their potential for clinical application beyond the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

The anterior cingulate is a focal point of pathology in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. Sulcation of the anterior cingulate is denoted by the presence of a paracingulate sulcus, a tertiary sulcus developing, where present during the third gestational trimester and remaining stable throughout life. This study aims to examine the impact of right paracingulate sulcal presence on the expression and prognosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. This retrospective analysis drew its population from two clinical samples recruited from memory clinics at university hospitals in the USA and The Netherlands. Individuals with sporadic behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia were enrolled between 2000 and 2022 and followed up for an average of 7.71 years. T1-MRI data were evaluated for hemispheric paracingulate sulcal presence in accordance with an established protocol by two blinded raters. Outcome measures included age at onset, survival, cortical thickness and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration-modified Clinical Dementia Rating determined clinical disease progression. The study population consisted of 186 individuals with sporadic behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (113 males and 73 females), mean age 63.28 years (SD 8.32). The mean age at onset was 2.44 years later in individuals possessing a right paracingulate sulcus [60.2 years (8.54)] versus individuals who did not [57.76 (8.05)], 95% confidence interval > 0.41, P = 0.02.

Nevertheless, current knowledge on the interplay between gut microbiota and the brain remains largely unclear. One of the primary mediating factors by which the gut microbiota interacts with the host is peripheral metabolites, including blood or gut-derived metabolites. However, mechanistic knowledge about the effect of the microbiome and metabolome signaling on the brain is limited. Neuroimaging techniques, such as multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), have the potential to directly elucidate brain structural and functional changes corresponding with alterations of the gut microbiota and peripheral metabolites in vivo.

In addition, our investigation delved into the regulatory functions of the inflammasome, IFN-I, NF-\u03baB, and PARK7/DJ-1 innate immune signaling pathway in the context of inflammatory and infective diseases. Ultimately, we discussed the efficacy of various interventions, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics, in the management of inflammatory and infective diseases. Understanding the role and mechanism of the MGB axis might make positive effects in the treatment of inflammatory and infective diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "Each human genome has tens of thousands of rare genetic variants; however, identifying impactful rare variants remains a major challenge. We demonstrate how use of personal multi-omics can enable identification of impactful rare variants by using the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, which included several hundred individuals, with whole-genome sequencing, transcriptomes, methylomes, and proteomes collected across two time points, 10 years apart. We evaluated each multi-omics phenotype's ability to separately and jointly inform functional rare variation. By combining expression and protein data, we observed rare stop variants 62 times and rare frameshift variants 216 times as frequently as controls, compared to 13-27 times as frequently for expression or protein effects alone. We extended a Bayesian hierarchical model, \"Watershed,\" to prioritize specific rare variants underlying multi-omics signals across the regulatory cascade. With this approach, we identified rare variants that exhibited large effect sizes on multiple complex traits including height, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that impairs neurocognitive function. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and \u03b2-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) are the two main proteins implicated in AD. Indeed, the major available commercial drugs (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) against Alzheimer's are AChE inhibitors. However, none of these drugs are known to reverse or reduce the pathophysiological condition of the disease since there are multiple contributing factors to AD. Therefore, there is a need to develop a multitarget-directed ligand approach for its treatment. In the present study, plant bioactive compounds were screened for their AChE and BACE1 inhibition potential by conducting molecular docking studies. Considering their docking score and pharmacokinetic properties, limonin, peimisine, serratanine B, and withanolide A were selected as the lead compounds. Molecular dynamics simulations of these protein-ligand complexes confirmed the conformational and energetically stabilized enzyme-inhibitor complexes. The inhibition potential of the lead compounds was validated by in vitro enzyme assay. Withanolide A inhibited AChE (IC50 value of 107 \u03bcM) and showed mixed-type inhibition. At this concentration, it inhibited BACE1 activity by 57.10% and was stated as most effective. Both the compounds, as well as their crude extracts, were found to have no cytotoxic effect on the SH-SY5Y cell line.",

        "AbstractText": "Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disorder, and its risk is influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. In this study, an AD risk gene prediction framework based on spatial and temporal features of gene expression data (STGE) was proposed. Methods: We proposed an AD risk gene prediction framework based on spatial and temporal features of gene expression data. The gene expression data of providers of different tissues and ages were used as model features. Human genes were classified as AD risk or non-risk sets based on information extracted from relevant databases. Support vector machine (SVM) models were constructed to capture the expression patterns of genes believed to contribute to the risk of AD. Results: The recursive feature elimination (RFE) method was utilized for feature selection. Data for 64 tissue-age features were obtained before feature selection, and this number was reduced to 19 after RFE was performed. The SVM models were built and evaluated using 19 selected and full features. The area under curve (AUC) values for the SVM model based on 19 selected features (0.740 [0.690-0.790]) and full feature sets (0.730 [0.678-0.769]) were very similar. Fifteen genes predicted to be risk genes for AD with a probability greater than 90% were obtained. Conclusion: The newly proposed framework performed comparably to previous prediction methods based on protein-protein interaction (PPI) network properties. A list of 15 candidate genes for AD risk was also generated to provide data support for further studies on the genetic etiology of AD.",

The lengthy and heterogeneous nature of clinical progression in AD contributes to the challenges inherent in demonstrating a clinically meaningful benefit of any potential new AD therapy. The failure of many large and expensive clinical trials to date has prompted a focus on optimizing all aspects of decision making, to not only expedite the development of new treatments, but also maximize the value of the information that each clinical trial yields, so that all future clinical trials (including those that are negative) will contribute toward advancing the field. To address this important topic the Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable convened December 1-2, 2020.

        "AbstractText": "Sphingolipids, as members of the large lipid family, are important components of plasma membrane. Sphingolipids participate in biological signal transduction to regulate various important physiological processes such as cell growth, apoptosis, senescence, and differentiation. Numerous studies have demonstrated that sphingolipids are strongly associated with glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance, including peripheral insulin resistance and brain insulin resistance, is closely related to the occurrence and development of many metabolic diseases. In addition to metabolic diseases, like type 2 diabetes, brain insulin resistance is also involved in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, the specific mechanism of sphingolipids in brain insulin resistance has not been systematically summarized. This article reviews the involvement of sphingolipids in brain insulin resistance, highlighting the role and molecular biological mechanism of sphingolipid metabolism in cognitive dysfunctions and neuropathological abnormalities of the brain.",

        "AbstractText": "Carriers of mutations responsible for dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease provide a unique opportunity to study potential imaging biomarkers. Biomarkers based on routinely acquired clinical MR images, could supplement the extant invasive or logistically challenging) biomarker studies. We used 1104 longitudinal MR, 324 amyloid beta, and 87 tau positron emission tomography imaging sessions from 525 participants enrolled in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Observational Study to extract novel imaging metrics representing the mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3) of standardized image intensities of T1-weighted and Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MR scans. There was an exponential decrease in FLAIR-\u03bc in mutation carriers and an increase in FLAIR and T1 signal heterogeneity (T1-\u03c3 and FLAIR-\u03c3) as participants approached the symptom onset in both supramarginal, the right postcentral and right superior temporal gyri as well as both caudate nuclei, putamina, thalami, and amygdalae. After controlling for the effect of regional atrophy, FLAIR-\u03bc decreased and T1-\u03c3 and FLAIR-\u03c3 increased with increasing amyloid beta and tau deposition in numerous cortical regions. In symptomatic mutation carriers and independent of the effect of regional atrophy, tau pathology demonstrated a stronger relationship with image intensity metrics, compared with amyloid pathology. We propose novel MR imaging intensity-based metrics using standard clinical T1 and FLAIR images which strongly associates with the progression of pathology in dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease. We suggest that tau pathology may be a key driver of the observed changes in this cohort of patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Personality change in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is complicated by the patient and informant factors that confound accurate reporting of personality traits. We assessed the impact of caregiver burden on informant report of Big Five personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness) and investigated the regional cortical volumes associated with larger discrepancies in the patient and informant report of the Big Five personality traits. Sixty-four ADRD participants with heterogeneous neurodegenerative clinical phenotypes and their informants completed the Big Five Inventory (BFI). Caregiver burden was measured using the Zarit Burden Interview. Discrepancy scores were computed as the difference between patient and informant ratings for the BFI. Regional gray matter volumes from T1-weighted 3T MRI were normalized to intracranial volume and related to global Big Five discrepancy scores using linear regression. Higher levels of caregiver burden were associated with higher informant ratings of patient neuroticism (\u00df\u2009=\u20090.08, p =\u00a0.012) and with lower informant ratings of patient agreeableness (\u00df\u2009=\u20090.11, p =\u00a0.021) and conscientiousness (\u00df\u2009=\u20090.04, p =\u00a0.034) independent of disease severity. Patients with greater Big Five discrepancy scores showed smaller cortical volumes in the right medial prefrontal cortex (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-5.24, p =\u00a0.045) and right superior temporal gyrus (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-7.91, p =\u00a0.028). Informant ratings of personality traits in ADRD can be confounded by the caregiver burden, highlighting the need for more objective measures of personality and behavior in dementia samples. Discrepancies between informant and patient ratings of personality may additionally reflect loss of insight secondary to cortical atrophy in the frontal and temporal structures.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the predominant impairment of neurons in the hippocampus and the formation of amyloid plaques, hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. The overexpression of amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) in an AD brain results in the binding of APP intracellular domain (AICD) to Fe65 protein via the C-terminal Fe65-PTB2 interaction, which then triggers the secretion of amyloid-\u03b2 and the consequent pathogenesis of AD. Apparently, targeting the interaction between APP and Fe65 can offer a promising therapeutic approach for AD. Recently, exosome, a type of extracellular vesicle with diameter around 30-200\u2009nm, has gained much attention as a potential delivery tool for brain diseases, including AD, due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, their efficient uptake by autologous cells, and their ability to be surface-modified with target-specific receptor ligands. Here, the engineering of hippocampus neuron cell-derived exosomes to overexpress Fe65, enabled the development of a novel exosome-based targeted drug delivery system, which carried Corynoxine-B (Cory-B, an autophagy inducer) to the APP overexpressed-neuron cells in the brain of AD mice. The Fe65-engineered HT22 hippocampus neuron cell-derived exosomes (Fe65-EXO) loaded with Cory-B (Fe65-EXO-Cory-B) hijacked the signaling and blocked the natural interaction between Fe65 and APP, enabling APP-targeted delivery of Cory-B. Notably, Fe65-EXO-Cory-B induced autophagy in APP-expressing neuronal cells, leading to amelioration of the cognitive decline and pathogenesis in AD mice, demonstrating the potential of Fe65-EXO-Cory-B as an effective therapeutic intervention for AD.",

Sleep disorders are one of the common chief complaints of neurodegenerative diseases. When patients suffer from comorbid sleep disorder and neurodegenerative diseases, the severity of their condition increases, the quality of their life drops further, and the difficulty of treatment increases. A large number of studies have been conducted to monitor the sleep of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, and it has been found that there are significant changes in their polysomnography (PSG) results compared to those of healthy control populations. In addition, there are also significant differences between the PSG findings of patients with different neurodegenerative diseases and the differences are closely associated with the pathogenesis and development of the disease. Herein, we discussed the characteristics of the sleep structure of patients with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and dementia with Lewy bodies and provided a brief review of the sleep disorders and the PSG characteristics of these patients. The paper will help improve the understanding of the pathogenesis and pathological changes of neurodegenerative diseases, clarify the relationship between sleep disorders and these diseases, improve clinicians' further understanding of these diseases, and provide a basis for future research. \u76ee\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u75c5\u56e0\u3001\u53d1\u75c5\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u7c7b\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u9884\u9632\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u53ca\u6cbb\u7597\u5e26\u6765\u96be\u9898\u3002\u7761\u7720\u969c\u788d\u662f\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u5e38\u89c1\u4e3b\u8bc9\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u5171\u75c5\u540e\uff0c\u52a0\u91cd\u4e86\u75c5\u60c5\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u60a3\u8005\u751f\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u5927\u4e86\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u7761\u7720\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e0e\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u7167\u4eba\u7fa4\u76f8\u6bd4\u591a\u5bfc\u7761\u7720\u56fe\uff08polysomnography, PSG\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u53d1\u5c55\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u63a2\u8ba8\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u3001\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u3001\u4ea8\u5ef7\u987f\u75c5\u4ee5\u53ca\u8def\u6613\u4f53\u75f4\u5446\u60a3\u8005\u7761\u7720\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u7761\u7720\u969c\u788d\u53caPSG\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u7b80\u8981\u7efc\u8ff0\u3002\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u52a0\u6df1\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u53d1\u75c5\u673a\u5236\u548c\u75c5\u7406\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u7761\u7720\u969c\u788d\u4e0e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u75be\u75c5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5bf9\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8ba4\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002",

GSE168522, the scRNA-seq dataset of AD peripheral blood immune cells, was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and was analyzed in the RAD-Blood web server (http://www.bioinform.cn/RAD-Blood/). The changes in blood cell composition in AD patients were analyzed. The abnormal communications between different types of cells in AD patients were investigated by the CellChat R package. There were two kinds of CD8 + T cells in the blood of AD patients and healthy individuals, one of which highly expressed granzyme K ( GZMK) (false discovery rate [FDR]<0.05), and the other highly expressed GZMA, GZMB, and GZMH (FDR<0.05). In the blood of AD patients, the content of GZMK + CD8 + T cells was increased by 32.9% ( P=5.15E-21), their interactions with other cell types were increased, and they might be associated with AD through the abnormal signal transduction of major histocompatibility complex class \u2160 (MHC-\u2160).

        "AbstractText": "The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is higher in people over the age of 65 and in African Americans (AA). Elevated acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity has been considered a major player in the onset of AD symptoms. As a result, many FDA-approved AD drugs target AChE inhibition to treat AD patients. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a signaling molecule known to downregulate oxidative stress and inflammation. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the blood is widely used as a biomarker to monitor inflammation and immunity. This study examined the hypothesis that plasma AChE levels have a negative association with H2S levels and that a positive association exists between levels of NLR, HbA1c, and ROS with the AChE in the peripheral blood. The fasting blood sample was taken from 114 African Americans who had provided written informed consent approved by the IRB. The effect of H2S and high-glucose treatment on AChE activity levels was also investigated in THP-1 human monocytes. There was a significant negative relationship between AChE and the levels of H2S (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.41, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001); a positive association between the levels of AChE with age (r\u00a0=\u00a00.26, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), NLR (r\u00a0=\u00a00.23, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), ROS (r\u00a0=\u00a00.23, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and HbA1c levels (r\u00a0=\u00a00.24, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), in AA subjects. No correlation was seen between blood levels of AChE and acetylcholine (ACh). Blood creatinine had a negative correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.23, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) with ACh levels. There was a significant effect of H2S on AChE inhibition and of high glucose in upregulating AChE activity in cultured monocytes. This study suggests hyperglycemia and lower H2S status can contribute to an increase in the AChE activity levels. Future clinical studies are needed to examine the potential benefits of supplementation with hydrogen sulfide pro-drugs/compounds in reducing the AChE and the cognitive dysfunctions associated with AD.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Alzheimer's disease: The role of proteins in formation, mechanisms, and new therapeutic approaches.",
        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects the central nervous system (CNS), leading to memory and cognitive decline. In AD, the brain experiences three main structural changes: a significant decrease in the quantity of neurons, the development of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and the formation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) or senile plaques, which are protein deposits found outside cells and surrounded by dystrophic neurites. Genetic studies have identified four genes associated with autosomal dominant or familial early-onset AD (FAD): amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2), and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). The formation of plaques primarily involves the accumulation of A\u03b2, which can be influenced by mutations in APP, PS1, PS2, or ApoE genes. Mutations in the APP and presenilin (PS) proteins can cause an increased amyloid \u03b2 peptides production, especially the further form of amyloidogenic known as A\u03b242. Apart from genetic factors, environmental factors such as cytokines and neurotoxins may also have a significant impact on the development and progression of AD by influencing the formation of amyloid plaques and intracellular tangles. Exploring the causes and implications of protein aggregation in the brain could lead to innovative therapeutic approaches. Some promising therapy strategies that have reached the clinical stage include using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, estrogen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antioxidants, and antiapoptotic agents. The most hopeful therapeutic strategies involve inhibiting activity of secretase and preventing the \u03b2-amyloid oligomers and fibrils formation, which are associated with the \u03b2-amyloid fibrils accumulation in AD. Additionally, immunotherapy development holds promise as a progressive therapeutic approach for treatment of AD. Recently, the two primary categories of brain stimulation techniques that have been studied for the treatment of AD are invasive brain stimulation (IBS) and non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS). In this article, the amyloid proteins that play a significant role in the AD formation, the mechanism of disease formation as well as new drugs utilized to treat of AD will be reviewed.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Discovery of FERM domain protein-protein interaction inhibitors for MSN and CD44 as a potential therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease.",
        "AbstractText": "Proteomic studies have identified moesin (MSN), a protein containing a FERM (four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain, and the receptor CD44 as hub proteins found within a co-expression module strongly linked to AD traits and microglia. These proteins are more abundant in Alzheimer's patient brains, and their levels are positively correlated with cognitive decline, amyloid plaque deposition and neurofibrillary tangle burden. The MSN FERM domain interacts with the phospholipid PIP2 and the cytoplasmic tail of CD44. Inhibiting the MSN-CD44 interaction may help limit AD-associated neuronal damage. Here, we investigated the feasibility of developing inhibitors that target this protein-protein interaction. We have employed structural, mutational and phage-display studies to examine how CD44 binds to the FERM domain of MSN. Interestingly, we have identified an allosteric site located close to the PIP2 binding pocket that influences CD44 binding. These findings suggest a mechanism in which PIP2 binding to the FERM domain stimulates CD44 binding through an allosteric effect, leading to the formation of a neighboring pocket capable of accommodating a receptor tail. Furthermore, high-throughput screening of a chemical library identified two compounds that disrupt the MSN-CD44 interaction. One compound series was further optimized for biochemical activity, specificity, and solubility. Our results suggest that the FERM domain holds potential as a drug development target. The small molecule preliminary leads generated from this study could serve as a foundation for additional medicinal chemistry efforts with the goal of controlling microglial activity in AD by modifying the MSN-CD44 interaction.",

        "AbstractText": "Depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are substantial public health concerns. In the past decades, a link between two disease entities has received extensive acknowledgment, yet the complex nature of this relationship has demanded further clarification. Some evidence indicates that mid-life depression may be an AD risk factor, while a chronic course of depression in late life may be a precursor to or symptom of dementia. Recently, multiple pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to underlie the bidirectional relationship between depression and AD, including genetic predisposition, immune dysregulation, the accumulation of AD-related biomarkers (e.g., amyloid beta and tau), and alterations in brain structure. That being the case, numerous therapeutic approaches, such as pharmacology treatments, psychotherapy, and lifestyle interventions, have been suggested as potential means of interfering with these pathways. However, the current literature on this topic remains fragmented and lacks a comprehensive review characterizing the association between depression and AD. In this review, we aim to address these gaps by providing an overview of the co-occurrence and temporal relationship between depression and AD, as well as exploring their underlying mechanisms. We also examine the current therapeutic regimens for depression and their implications for AD management, and outline key challenges facing the field.",

        "AbstractText": "Every year, thousands of children, particularly those under five years old, die because of cerebral malaria (CM). Following conventional treatment, approximately 25% of surviving individuals have lifelong severe neurocognitive sequelae. Therefore, improved conventional therapies or effective alternative therapies that prevent the severe infection are crucial. Omega-3 (\u03a9-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are known to have antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects and protect against diverse neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. However, little is known regarding the effects of \u03a9-3 PUFAs against parasitic infections. In this study, C57BL/6 mice received supplemental treatment of a fish oil rich in the \u03a9-3 PUFA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which was started 15 days prior to infection with Plasmodium berghei ANKA and was maintained until the end of the study. Animals treated with the highest doses of DHA, 3.0 and 6.0 g/kg body weight, had 60 and 80% chance of survival, respectively, while all non-treated mice died by the 7th day post-infection due to CM. Furthermore, the parasite load during the critical period for CM development (5th to 11th day post-infection) was controlled in treated mice. However, after this period all animals developed high levels of parasitemia until the 20th day of infection. DHA treatment also effectively reduced blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and brain edema and completely prevented brain hemorrhage and vascular occlusion. A strong anti-inflammatory profile was observed in the brains of DHA-treated mice, as well as, an increased number of neutrophil and reduced number of CD8+ T leukocytes in the spleen. Thus, this is the first study to demonstrate that the prophylactic use of DHA-rich fish oil exerts protective effects against experimental CM, reducing the mechanical and immunological events caused by the P. berghei ANKA infection.",

        "AbstractText": "Melatonin, a neurohormone secreted by the pineal gland and regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, is synthesized and directly released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the third ventricle (3rdv), where it undergoes rapid absorption by surrounding tissues to exert its physiological function. The hippocampus, a vital structure in the limbic system adjacent to the ventricles, plays a pivotal role in emotional response and memory formation. Melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that primarily mediate melatonin's receptor-dependent effects. In comparison to the MT1 receptor, the widely expressed MT2 receptor is crucial for mediating melatonin's biological functions within the hippocampus. Specifically, MT2 receptor is implicated in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory processes, as well as neurogenesis and axogenesis. Numerous studies have demonstrated the involvement of MT2 receptors in the pathophysiology and pharmacology of Alzheimer's disease, depression, and epilepsy. This review focuses on the anatomical localization of MT2 receptor in the hippocampus, their physiological function in this region, and their signal transduction and pharmacological roles in neurological disorders. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive review of MT2 receptor ligands used in psychopharmacology and other MT2-selective ligands over recent years. Ultimately, we provide an outlook on future research for selective MT2 receptor drug candidates.",

Insulin resistance serves as a pivotal link between these two conditions, leading to diminished insulin sensitivity, hyperglycemia, and impaired glucose uptake. The brain, a vital organ in AD context, is also significantly impacted by insulin resistance, resulting in energy deficits and neuronal damage, which are hallmark features of the neurodegenerative disorder. To pave the way for potential therapeutic interventions targeting the insulin resistance pathway, it is crucial to comprehend the intricate pathophysiology of T3DM and identify the overlapped features between diabetes and AD. This comprehensive review article aims to explore various pathway such as AMPK, PPAR\u03b3, cAMP and P13K/Akt pathway as potential target for management of T3DM. Through the analysis of these complex mechanisms, our goal is to reveal their interdependencies and support the discovery of innovative therapeutic strategies. The review extensively discusses several promising pharmaceutical candidates that have demonstrated dual drug action mechanisms, addressing both peripheral and cerebral insulin resistance observed in T3DM. These candidates hold significant promise for restoring insulin function and mitigating the detrimental effects of insulin resistance on the brain. The exploration of these therapeutic options contributes to the development of innovative interventions that alleviate the burden of T3DM and enhance patient care.",

For the first time, the application of water-soluble pillar[5]arenes containing amino acid residues as effective cholinesterase inhibitors was shown. The influence of the nature of aliphatic and aromatic alpha-amino acid residues (glycine, l-alanine, l-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan) on self-assembly, aggregate's stability, cytotoxicity on A549 and LEK cells and cholinesterase inhibition was studied. It was found that the studied compounds with aliphatic amino acid residues showed a low inhibitory ability against cholinesterases.

Cognitive reserve has been associated with delaying the onset and slowing the progression of CI in PwMS. Multilingualism has been demonstrated to be a protective factor against CI in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but has never been studied in PwMS. To explore if multilingualism is a protective factor against CI in PwMS. This is a retrospective cohort study of PwMS aged 18-59, with a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing MS, fluent in English, who completed the Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in MS (MACFIMS) at the London (ON) MS Clinic. Any PwMS with a history of dementia or developmental delay, daily marijuana use, a major psychiatric disorder, or less than grade 9 education was excluded. We focused on the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMTR), immediate recall (-IR) and delayed recall (-DR) as it would be the least affected by language, as well as the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), as information processing speed is the most commonly affected domain in PwMS. One-way ANOVA was used to compare raw scores on the BVMTR and SDMT between groups (uni- vs. multillingual), while chi-square was used to compare impairment on BVMTR and SDMT between groups. The cohort consisted of 678 subjects. The mean age was 39.7 (\u00b1\u00a09.6) years with 501 (73.9\u00a0%) females (sex at birth), the mean duration of disease of 5.9 (\u00b1\u00a06.9) years, and mean years of education was 13.9 (\u00b12.2). The majority of subjects (563, 83\u00a0%) were unilingual and (115, 17\u00a0%) were multilingual; 102 subjects were bilingual and 13 subjects fluent in \u2265 three languages. English was the first language was in most of subjects (614, 90.6\u00a0%). There was no significant difference on the BVMTR-IR scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.189) or BVMTR-DR (p\u00a0=\u00a00.096) between groups. Similarly, there was no difference in the number of subjects impaired on the BVMTR-IR (X2 (1, N\u00a0=\u00a0678)\u00a0=\u00a03.167, p\u00a0=\u00a00.057) or BVMT-DR between groups (X2 (1, N\u00a0=\u00a0678)\u00a0=\u00a02.996, p\u00a0=\u00a00.083).

We investigated the effect of ACEI, STAT or combination of both by exploring the transcriptomic, proteomic and tau pathology profiles after treatment in both human patients and in P301S transgenic mice (PS19) modeling tauopathies and AD. We performed bioinformatic analysis of enriched pathways after treatment. Proteomics and transcriptomics analysis revealed proteins and genes whose expression is significantly changed in subjects receiving treatment with ACEI, STAT or combined drugs. In mice, treatment with the ACEI lisinopril significantly decreased brain levels of total tau (Tau) and phosphorylated tau (pTau)-181, while the STAT atorvastatin significantly reduced the levels of pTau-396. The combined therapy with lisinopril and atorvastatin significantly decreased Tau. Moreover, brain levels of lisinopril were negatively correlated with Tau.

Thus, we aimed to screen natural small molecules from crude extracts that target various pathologies and are prescribed for patients with neurological diseases. In this study, we screened 162 natural small molecules prescribed for neurological diseases and identified genipin and pyrogallol as hit compounds capable of simultaneously regulating the aggregation of A\u03b2 and tau K18.

Loneliness was not significantly related to any EF measure (p-values\u2009=\u2009.13-.65), nor was social isolation (p-values\u2009=\u2009.11-.69).

        "AbstractText": "Drug designing is high-priced and time taking process with low success rate. To overcome this obligation, computational drug repositioning technique is being promptly used to predict the possible therapeutic effects of FDA approved drugs against multiple diseases. In this computational study, protein modeling, shape-based screening, molecular docking, pharmacogenomics, and molecular dynamic simulation approaches have been utilized to retrieve the FDA approved drugs against AD. The predicted MADD protein structure was designed by homology modeling and characterized through different computational resources. Donepezil and galantamine were implanted as standard drugs and drugs were screened out based on structural similarities. Furthermore, these drugs were evaluated and based on binding energy (Kcal/mol) profiles against MADD through PyRx tool. Moreover, pharmacogenomics analysis showed good possible associations with AD mediated genes and confirmed through detail literature survey. The best 6 drug (darifenacin, astemizole, tubocurarine, elacridar, sertindole and tariquidar) further docked and analyzed their interaction behavior through hydrogen binding. Finally, MD simulation study were carried out on these drugs and evaluated their stability behavior by generating root mean square deviation and fluctuations (RMSD/F), radius of gyration (Rg) and soluble accessible surface area (SASA) graphs. Taken together, darifenacin, astemizole, tubocurarine, elacridar, sertindole and tariquidar displayed good lead like profile as compared with standard and can be used as possible therapeutic agent in the treatment of AD after in-vitro and in-vivo assessment.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Tau accumulation in degradative organelles is associated to lysosomal stress.",
        "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the brain deposition of insoluble amyloidogenic proteins, such as \u03b1-synuclein or Tau, and the concomitant deterioration of cell functions such as the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). The ALP is involved in the degradation of intracellular macromolecules including protein aggregates. ALP dysfunction due to inherited defects in lysosomal or non-lysosomal proteins causes a group of diseases called lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) because of abnormal accumulation of lysosomal degradation substrates. Supporting the contribution of ALP defects in neurodegenerative diseases, deposition of amyloidogenic proteins occurs in LSD. Moreover, heterozygous mutations of several ALP genes represent risk factors for Parkinson's disease. The reciprocal contribution of \u03b1-synuclein accumulation and lysosomal dysfunction have been extensively studied. However, whether this adverse crosstalk also embraces Tau pathology needs more investigation. Here, we show in human primary fibroblasts that Tau seeds isolated from the brain of Alzheimer's disease induce Tau accumulation in acidic degradative organelles and lysosomal stress. Furthermore, inhibition of glucocerebrosidase, a lysosomal enzyme mutated in Gaucher's disease and a main risk for Parkinson's disease, causes lysosomal dysfunction in primary fibroblasts and contributes to the accumulation of Tau. Considering the presence of Tau lesions in Parkinson's disease as well as in multiple neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, our data call for further studies on strategies to alleviate ALP dysfunction as new therapeutic opportunity for neurodegenerative diseases and LSD.",

        "AbstractText": "Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a transmembrane protein that is predominantly expressed by microglia in the brain. The proteolytic shedding of TREM2 results in the release of soluble TREM2 (sTREM2), which is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). It remains unknown whether sTREM2 regulates the pathogenesis of AD. Here we identified transgelin-2 (TG2) expressed on neurons as the receptor for sTREM2. The microglia-derived sTREM2 binds to TG2, induces RhoA phosphorylation at S188, and deactivates the RhoA-ROCK-GSK3\u03b2 pathway, ameliorating tau phosphorylation. The sTREM2 (77-89) fragment, which is the minimal active sequence of sTREM2 to activate TG2, mimics the inhibitory effect of sTREM2 on tau phosphorylation. Overexpression of sTREM2 or administration of the active peptide rescues tau pathology and behavioral defects in the tau P301S transgenic mice. Together, these findings demonstrate that the sTREM2-TG2 interaction mediates the cross-talk between microglia and neurons. sTREM2 and its active peptide may be a potential therapeutic intervention for tauopathies including AD.",

Hence, stress-induced alterations represent a key target for pharmacological interventions aimed at restoring brain function in affected individuals. We have previously demonstrated that lurasidone, a multi-receptor antipsychotic drug approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar depression, can normalize the functional and molecular impairments induced by stress exposure, representing a valuable tool for the treatment of stress-induced mental illnesses. However, the mechanisms that may contribute to the therapeutic effects of lurasidone are still poorly understood.\u202fHere, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of adult male rats exposed to the chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm and we investigated the impact of chronic lurasidone treatment on such changes. We found that CMS exposure leads to an anhedonic phenotype associated with a down-regulation of different pathways associated to neuronal guidance and synaptic plasticity within the PFC. Interestingly, a significant part of these alterations (around 25%) were counteracted by lurasidone treatment. In summary, we provided new insights on the transcriptional changes relevant for the therapeutic intervention with lurasidone, which may ultimately promote resilience.",

        "AbstractText": "Recent studies emphasized the necessity to identify key (human) biological processes and pathways targeted by the Coronaviridae family of viruses, especially Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) caused up to 33-55\u00a0% death rates in COVID-19 patients with malignant neoplasms and Alzheimer's disease. Given this scenario, we identified biological processes and pathways involved in various diseases which are most likely affected by COVID-19. The COVID-19 DisGeNET data set (v4.0) contains the associations between various diseases and human genes known to interact with viruses from Coronaviridae family and were obtained from the IntAct Coronavirus data set annotated with DisGeNET data. We constructed the disease-gene network to identify genes that are involved in various comorbid diseased states. Communities from the disease-gene network were identified using Louvain method and functional enrichment through over-representation analysis methodology was used to discover significant biological processes and pathways shared between COVID-19 and other diseases. The COVID-19 DisGeNET data set (v4.0) comprised of 828 human genes and 10,473 diseases (including various phenotypes) that together constituted nodes in the disease-gene network. Each of the 70,210 edges connects a human gene with an associated disease. The top 10 genes linked to most number of diseases were VEGFA, BCL2, CTNNB1, ALB, COX2, AGT, HLA-A, HMOX1, FGF2 and COMT. The most vulnerable group of patients thus discovered had comorbid conditions such as carcinomas, malignant neoplasms and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we identified 15 potentially useful biological processes and pathways for improved therapies. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the key mediator of angiogenesis in cancer. It is widely distributed in the brain and plays a crucial role in brain inflammation regulating the level of angiopoietins. With a degree of 1899, VEGFA was associated with maximum number of diseases in the disease-gene network. Previous studies have indicated that increased levels of VEGFA in the blood results in dyspnea, Pulmonary Edema (PE), Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). In case of COVID-19 patients with neoplasms and other neurological symptoms, our results indicate VEGFA as a therapeutic target for inflammation suppression. As VEGFs are known to disproportionately affect cancer patients, improving endothelial permeability and vasodilation with anti-VEGF therapy could lead to suppression of inflammation and also improve oxygenation. As an outcome of our study, we make case for clinical investigations towards anti-VEGF therapies for such comorbid conditions affected by COVID-19 for better therapeutic outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "Hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma cholesterol does not pass the blood-brain barrier whereas its metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) can enter the brain. High 27-OHC in the brain has been suggested to mediate hypercholesterolemia-induced impairments of learning and memory through promoting amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation and facilitating synaptic disruption. In AD brains, the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) is elevated. Treating AD animals with HDAC inhibitors decreases amyloid-\u03b2 levels and synaptic damages, which leads to memory improvement. Whether HDAC activity is involved in the actions of 27-OHC is still uncertain. In this study, 4 weekly injections of 27-OHC/vehicle were given to rats followed by 3 daily injections of HDAC inhibitor tricohstatin (TSA)/vehicle. The results of Morris water maze test reveal that all rats have intact spatial learning ability during the 5-d training phase. However, the behavioral performance during the probe trial was impaired by 27-OHC treatment, which was improved by adding TSA treatments. Furthermore, 27-OHC treatments reduced the hippocampal levels of acetylated histone H3, acetylated \u03b1 tubulin, insulin-degrading enzyme and postsynaptic protein PSD-95, indicating that 27-OHC treatments may induce enhanced HDAC activity, decreased amyloid-\u03b2 clearance and synaptic disruption. All reduced levels returned to the basal levels by adding TSA treatments. These findings support our hypothesis that HDAC activity is enhanced following long-term exposure to excess 27-OHC.",

All patients were tested for neuronal autoantibodies using cell-based assays. Clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings were retrospectively reviewed. We identified 16 patients, 15 had subacute, and one had a progressive disease course. Among patients with subacute onset, 11 (73\u00a0%) were N-Methyl-d-Aspartate receptor (NMDAr-IgG)+, 3 (20\u00a0%) were Leucine-rich Glioma-Inactivated-1 (LGI1-IgG)+, and 1 (6\u00a0%) was positive for Glycine receptor-IgG.

Consumption of coffee is thought to reduce Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the mechanism is still unexplored. Primarily, it is thought that components of coffee are the key players in making it a neuroprotectant. Caffeic acid (CA) is found in high quantities in coffee; thus, it is being increasingly explored to decipher its neuroprotection by various mechanisms. Iron is a toxic element in a free form capable of causing oxidative damage and ultimately contributing to the pathogenesis of AD. Thus, maintaining the proper iron levels is vital and human transferrin (Htf), a glycoprotein, is a key player in this aspect. In this work, we explored the binding mechanism of CA with Htf at the atomistic level, employing molecular docking and extensive molecular dynamics simulation (MD) approaches coupled with spectroscopic techniques in a bid to decipher the mode of interaction of CA with Htf. Molecular docking results demonstrated a strong binding affinity between CA and Htf. Furthermore, MD study highlighted the Htf-CA complex's stability and the ligand's minimal impact on Htf's overall structure. In silico approaches were further backed up by experimental approaches. Strong binding of CA with Htf was ascertained by UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy observations.

It is also effective in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), ischemic stroke, and the CNS complications of diabetes, all of which share some pathological features with HD. Potent derivatives of fisetin with improved pharmacology were made that maintain its multiple biological activities (J. Med. Chem. 55:378, 2012). From 160 synthetic fisetin derivatives, one, CMS121, was selected for further study in the context of HD based on pharmacological parameters and its efficacy in animal models of AD. Both R6/2 and YAC128 mouse models of HD were used in these studies. We examined motor function using multiple assays as well as survival. In the R6/2 mice, we also looked at the effects of CMS121 on striatal gene expression. In both models, we found a slowing of motor dysfunction and an increase in median life span. Interestingly, in the YAC128 mice, the effects on the slowing in motor function loss became increasingly more pronounced as the mice aged. CMS121 also reduced HD-driven changes in the expression of genes associated with the proteasome and oxidative phosphorylation. Overall, these results suggest that CMS121 could provide some benefits for HD patients, particularly with regard to increasing health span.",

Trichostatin A (TSA) has been revealed to show protective effect on central nervous systems in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. However, the effect and molecular mechanism of TSA on cognitive function of DE are unknown. Here, we demonstrated that cognitive function was damaged in diabetic mice versus normal mice and treatment with TSA improved cognitive function in diabetic mice. Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus revealed 174 differentially expressed proteins in diabetic mice compared with normal mice. TSA treatment reversed the expression levels of 111 differentially expressed proteins grouped into functional clusters, including the longevity regulating pathway, the insulin signaling pathway, peroxisomes, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosomes. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction network analysis of TSA-reversed proteins revealed that UBA52, CAT, RPL29, RPL35A, CANX, RPL37, and PRKAA2 were the main hub proteins. Multiple KEGG pathway-enriched CAT and PRKAA2 levels were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of diabetic mice versus normal mice, which was reversed by TSA administration.

Sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index. There was no effect of the exercise intervention on any sleep outcomes from pre- to post-intervention. There was a significant moderating effect of baseline sleep efficiency on both episodic memory and global cognition within the moderate intensity exercise group, such that those with poorer sleep efficiency at baseline showed greater exercise-induced improvements in episodic memory. These results suggest that those with poorer sleep may have the greatest exercise-induced cognitive benefits and that baseline sleep behaviours may be an important source of heterogeneity in previous exercise interventions targeting cognitive outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "The current study examined whether informal caregivers performed worse, better, or similar to non-caregivers on cognitive tests of executive functioning and episodic memory over 10\u00a0years. Methods: Data were from waves 2 (2003-04) and 3 (2013-14) of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study (N = 2086). Multiple linear regression models examined whether caregiving at both waves 2 and 3 predicted better cognitive functioning at wave 3, than caregiving at only one time point or no caregiving (reference) while controlling for baseline covariates (i.e., sociodemographic, health, and functional status). After controlling for covariates, caregiving at both waves was independently associated with better performance in episodic memory (b = .24, SE = .10, p = .013) but not executive function (b = -.06, SE = .05, p = .246). Discussion:The findings partially supported both healthy caregiver and stress process models, indicating caregiving may be associated with better episodic memory but not executive functioning over time among the middle-aged and older adults.",

        "AbstractText": "Aggravated neuronal loss, caused mainly by neuronal apoptosis, is observed in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and animal models of AD. A truncated form of Dual-specific and tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated protein kinase 1A (Dyrk1A) plays a vital role in AD pathogenesis. Downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL is tightly correlated with neuronal loss in AD. However, the molecular regulation of neuronal apoptosis and Bcl-x expression by Dyrk1A in AD remains largely elusive. Here, we aimed to explore the role and molecular mechanism of Dyrk1A in apoptosis. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8), flow cytometry, and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) were used to check apoptosis. The cells, transfected with Dyrk1A or/and ASF with Bcl-x minigene, were used to assay Bcl-x expression by RT-PCR and Western blots. Co-immunoprecipitation, autoradiography, and immunofluorescence were conducted to check the interaction of ASF and Dyrk1A. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of apoptosis-related genes was performed in mice overexpressing Dyrk1A (TgDyrk1A) and AD model 5xFAD mice. Dyrk1A promoted Bcl-xS expression and apoptosis. Splicing factor ASF promoted Bcl-x exon 2b inclusion, leading to increased Bcl-xL expression. Dyrk1A suppressed ASF-mediated Bcl-x exon 2b inclusion via phosphorylation. The C-terminus deletion of Dyrk1A facilitated its binding and kinase activity to ASF. Moreover, Dyrk1a1-483 further suppressed the ASF-mediated Bcl-x exon 2b inclusion and aggravated apoptosis. The truncated Dyrk1A, increased Bcl-xS, and enrichment of apoptosis-related genes was observed in the brain of 5xFAD mice. We speculate that increased Dyrk1A and truncated Dyrk1A may aggravate neuronal apoptosis by decreasing the ratio of Bcl-xL/Bcl-xS via phosphorylating ASF in AD.",

This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of QMTA and its related components (inferior lateral ventricle [ILV] and hippocampus) with MTA in the early diagnosis of MCI and AD. This study included four groups: normal (NC), MCI stable (MCIs), MCI converted to AD (MCIs), and mild AD (M-AD) groups. Magnetic resonance image analysis software was used to quantify the hippocampus, ILV, and QMTA. MTA was rated by two experienced neurologists. Receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) analysis was performed to compare their capability in differentiating AD from NC and MCI, and optimal thresholds were determined using the Youden index. QMTA distinguished M-AD from NC and MCI with higher diagnostic accuracy than MTA, hippocampus, and ILV (AUCNC \u2009=\u20090.976, AUCMCI \u2009=\u20090.836, AUCMCIs \u2009=\u20090.894, AUCMCIc \u2009=\u20090.730). The diagnostic accuracy of QMTA was superior to that of MTA, the hippocampus, and ILV in differentiating MCI from AD. The diagnostic accuracy of QMTA was found to remain the best across age, sex, and pathological subgroups analyzed. The sensitivity (92.45%) and specificity (90.64%) were higher in this study when a cutoff value of 0.635 was chosen for QMTA.

        "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative disease is a collective term for a category of diseases that are caused by neuronal dysfunction, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs without the 3' cap and 5' poly(A) and are linked by covalent bonds. CircRNAs are highly expressed in brain neurons and can regulate the pathological process of neurodegenerative diseases by affecting the levels of various deposition proteins. This review is aiming to suggest that the majority of circRNAs influence neurodegenerative pathologies mainly by affecting the abnormal deposition of proteins in neurodegenerative diseases. We systematically summarized the pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases and the regulatory mechanisms of circRNAs in various types of neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative disease main features include intercellular ubiquitin-proteasome system abnormalities, changes in cytoskeletal proteins, and the continuous deposition of insoluble protein fragments and inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm or nucleus, resulting in impairment of the normal physiological processes of the neuronal system. CircRNAs have multiple mechanisms, such as acting as microRNA sponges, binding to proteins, and regulating transcription. CircRNAs, which are highly stable molecules, are expected to be potential biomarkers for the pathological detection of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD. In this review, we describe the regulatory roles and mechanisms of circRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases and aim to employ circRNAs as biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. Impaired autophagy in plaque-associated microglia (PAM) has been reported to accelerate amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive impairment in AD pathogenesis. Recent evidence suggests that the transcription factor EB (TFEB)-mediated activation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway is a promising treatment approach for AD. Moreover, the complementary therapy of intermittent hypoxia therapy (IHT) has been shown to upregulate autophagy and impart beneficial effects in patients with AD. However, the effect of IHT on PAM remains unknown. 8-Month-old APP/PS1 mice were treated with IHT for 28 days. Spatial learning memory capacity and anxiety in mice were investigated. AD pathology was determined by the quantity of nerve fibers and synapses density, numbers of microglia and neurons, A\u03b2 plaque deposition, pro-inflammatory factors, and the content of A\u03b2 in the brain. TFEB-mediated autophagy was determined by western blot and qRT-PCR. Primary microglia were treated with oligomeric A\u03b2 1-42 (oA\u03b2) combined with IHT for mechanism exploration. Differential genes were screened by RNA-seq. Autophagic degradation process of intracellular oA\u03b2 was traced by immunofluorescence. In this study, we found that IHT ameliorated cognitive function by attenuating neuronal loss and axonal injury in an AD animal model (APP/PS1 mice) with beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) pathology. In addition, IHT-mediated neuronal protection was associated with reduced A\u03b2 accumulation and plaque formation. Using an in vitro PAM model, we further confirmed that IHT upregulated autophagy-related proteins, thereby promoting the A\u03b2 autophagic degradation by PAM. Mechanistically, IHT facilitated the nuclear localization of TFEB in PAM, with TFEB activity showing a positive correlation with A\u03b2 degradation by PAM in vivo and in vitro. In addition, IHT-induced TFEB activation was associated with the inhibition of the AKT-MAPK-mTOR pathway. These results suggest that IHT alleviates neuronal damage and neuroinflammation via the upregulation of TFEB-dependent A\u03b2 clearance by PAM, leading to improved learning and memory in AD mice. Therefore, IHT may be a promising non-pharmacologic therapy in complementary medicine against AD.",

We aimed to determine whether antihypertensive drug classes differentially affect microvascular function in people with small vessel disease. We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised crossover trial with blinded endpoint assessment at five specialist centres in Europe. We included participants aged 18 years or older with symptomatic sporadic small vessel disease or cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and an indication for antihypertensive treatment. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three sequences of antihypertensive treatment using a computer-generated multiblock randomisation, stratified by study site and patient group. A 2-week washout period was followed by three 4-week periods of oral monotherapy with amlodipine, losartan, or atenolol at approved doses. The primary endpoint was change in cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) determined by blood oxygen level-dependent MRI response to hypercapnic challenge in normal-appearing white matter from the end of washout to the end of each treatment period. Efficacy analyses were done by intention-to-treat principles in all randomly assigned participants who had at least one valid assessment for the primary endpoint, and analyses were done separately for participants with sporadic small vessel disease and CADASIL.

Microglia have long been considered to have detrimental roles in Alzheimer's disease. However, functional analyses of genes encoding risk factors that are linked to late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and that are enriched or exclusively expressed in microglia, have revealed unexpected protective functions. One of the major risk genes for Alzheimer's disease is TREM2. Risk variants of TREM2 are loss-of-function mutations affecting chemotaxis, phagocytosis, lipid and energy metabolism, and survival and proliferation. Agonistic anti-TREM2 antibodies have been developed to boost these protective functions in patients with intact TREM2 alleles. Several anti-TREM2 antibodies are in early clinical trials, and current efforts aim to achieve more efficient transport of these antibodies across the blood-brain barrier. PET imaging could be used to monitor target engagement. Data from animal models, and biomarker studies in patients, further support a rationale for boosting TREM2 functions during the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease.",

However, which receptors in the vDG could be targeted to inhibit this hyperactivity and confer stress resilience is not known. The serotonin 1A receptor (5HT1AR) is a Gi protein coupled inhibitory receptor that has been implicated in stress adaptation, anxiety, depression, and antidepressant responses. 5HT1ARs are highly expressed in the DG, but their potential to promote stress resilience by regulating granule cell activity has never been examined. We exposed male and female mice expressing 5HT1ARs only in DG granule cells to 10 days of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) and treated them with the 5HT1AR agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) every day 30 min before each defeat throughout the CSDS paradigm. We then used whole-cell current clamp recordings, immunohistochemistry for the immediate early gene, cFos, corticosterone immunoassays, and behavioral testing to determine how activating 5HT1ARs on granule cells affects DG activity, neuroendocrine stress responses, and avoidance behavior. We find that activating 5HT1ARs hyperpolarizes DG granule cells and reduces cFos+ granule cells in the vDG following CSDS, indicating that 5HT1AR activation rescues stress-induced vDG hyperactivity. Moreover, 5HT1AR activation dampens corticosterone responses to CSDS and prevents the development of stress-induced avoidance in the social interaction test and in the open field test. Our findings show that activating 5HT1ARs on DG granule cells can prevent stress-induced neuronal hyperactivity of the vDG and confer resilience to chronic stress.",

Still, the mechanisms underlying these APOE4-driven pathological effects remain elusive. Here, we report in a tauopathy mouse model that APOE4 promoted the nucleocytoplasmic translocation and release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) from hippocampal neurons, which correlated with the severity of hippocampal microgliosis and degeneration. Injection of HMGB1 into the hippocampus of young APOE4-tauopathy mice induced considerable and persistent gliosis. Selective removal of neuronal APOE4 reduced HMGB1 translocation and release. Treatment of APOE4-tauopathy mice with HMGB1 inhibitors effectively blocked the intraneuronal translocation and release of HMGB1 and ameliorated the development of APOE4-driven gliosis, Tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and myelin deficits. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that treatment with HMGB1 inhibitors diminished disease-associated and enriched disease-protective subpopulations of neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in APOE4-tauopathy mice.

Among others, the use of cannabinoids such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) has been proposed as a putative approach based on their anti-inflammatory effects. Methods: The present work was designed to explore the effects of chronic (28 days) treatment with low doses of cannabinoids: CBD (0.273\u2009mg/kg), THC (0.205\u2009mg/kg) or a combination of both (CBD:THC; 0.273\u2009mg/kg:0.205\u2009mg/kg) in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD.

A significant improvement in spatial memory was observed only in the CBD:THC-treated group. Interestingly, all cannabinoid-treated groups showed significantly increased cortical levels of the insoluble form of beta amyloid 1-42. These effects were not accompanied by changes in molecular parameters of inflammation at the mRNA or protein level.

Acute standardized total average toxicity (rSTATacute) was modelled using a generalized linear regression model for additive effect of genetic variants adjusted for demographic and clinical covariates. LD score regression estimated shared SNP-based heritability of rSTATacute in all patients and for each cancer type. Shared SNP-based heritability of STATacute among all cancer types was estimated at 10% (se\u2009=\u20090.02), and was higher for prostate (17%, se\u2009=\u20090.07), head and neck (27%, se\u2009=\u20090.09), and breast (16%, se\u2009=\u20090.09) cancers. We identified 130 suggestive associated SNPs with rSTATacute (5.0x10-8<P-value<1.0x10-5) across 25 genomic regions. rs142667902 showed the strongest association (effect allele A; effect size -0.17; P-value=1.7x10-7), which is located near DPPA4, encoding a protein involved in pluripotency in stem cells, which are essential for repair of radiation-induced tissue injury.

Although biomarkers such as cerebrospinal fluid amyloid level and magnetic resonance imaging have been studied, they have limitations, such as high cost and invasiveness. Digital markers to assess cognitive impairment by analyzing behavioral data collected from digital devices in daily life can be a new alternative. In this context, we developed a \"virtual kiosk test\" for early screening of MCI by analyzing behavioral data collected when using a kiosk in a virtual environment. We aimed to investigate key behavioral features collected from a virtual kiosk test that could distinguish patients with MCI from healthy controls with high statistical significance. Also, we focused on developing a machine learning model capable of early screening of MCI based on these behavioral features. A total of 51 participants comprising 20 healthy controls and 31 patients with MCI were recruited by 2 neurologists from a university hospital. The participants performed a virtual kiosk test-developed by our group-where we recorded various behavioral data such as hand and eye movements. Based on these time series data, we computed the following 4 behavioral features: hand movement speed, proportion of fixation duration, time to completion, and the number of errors. To compare these behavioral features between healthy controls and patients with MCI, independent-samples 2-tailed t tests were used. Additionally, we used these behavioral features to train and validate a machine learning model for early screening of patients with MCI from healthy controls. In the virtual kiosk test, all 4 behavioral features showed statistically significant differences between patients with MCI and healthy controls. Compared with healthy controls, patients with MCI had slower hand movement speed (t49=3.45; P=.004), lower proportion of fixation duration (t49=2.69; P=.04), longer time to completion (t49=-3.44; P=.004), and a greater number of errors (t49=-3.77; P=.001). All 4 features were then used to train a support vector machine to distinguish between healthy controls and patients with MCI. Our machine learning model achieved 93.3% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, 83.3% specificity, 90% precision, and 94.7% F1-score. Our research preliminarily suggests that analyzing hand and eye movements in the virtual kiosk test holds potential as a digital marker for early screening of MCI. In contrast to conventional biomarkers, this digital marker in virtual reality is advantageous as it can collect ecologically valid data at an affordable cost and in a short period (5-15 minutes), making it a suitable means for early screening of MCI.

Of the total sample, 20% (76/371) installed the app and signed informed consent, showing a large dropout during onboarding. The high number of questions was a relevant barrier for participants. Both questionnaire and gameplay adherence were low. Participants indicated that the games elicited contact and a feeling of togetherness and proposed challenging and competitive games with increasing difficulty levels. They suggested focusing on enjoying the games rather than administering questionnaires. Conducting a remote digital trial of a social gaming intervention for older adults is a great challenge. Remote recruitment and informed consent acquisition may often not result in sufficient participation. Personal engagement with fellow participants and researchers might be essential for adherence and enjoyment. Future digital gaming interventions should start with small-scale studies with in-person contact, repeated instructions, and fewer questionnaires.",

We evaluated morphological and functional differences between MCI with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB) and MCI due to AD (MCI-AD), and a method for differentiating between these conditions using brain MRI and brain perfusion SPECT. A continuous series of 101 subjects, who had visited our memory clinic and met the definition of MCI, were enrolled retrospectively. They were consisted of 60 MCI-LB and 41 MCI-AD subjects. Relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) on SPECT images and relative brain atrophy on MRI images were evaluated. We performed voxel-based analysis and visually inspected brain perfusion SPECT images for regional brain atrophy, occipital hypoperfusion and the cingulate island sign (CIS), for differential diagnosis of MCI-LB and MCI-AD. MRI showed no significant differences in regional atrophy between the MCI-LB and MCI-AD groups. In MCI-LB subjects, occipital rCBF was significantly decreased compared with MCI-AD subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.01, family wise error [FWE]-corrected). Visual inspection of occipital hypoperfusion had sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values of 100%, 73.2% and 89.1%, respectively, for differentiating MCI-LB and MCI-AD. Occipital hypoperfusion was offered higher diagnostic utility than the CIS. The occipital lobe was the region with significantly decreased rCBF in MCI-LB compared with MCI-AD subjects. Occipital hypoperfusion on brain perfusion SPECT may be a more useful imaging biomarker than the CIS for visually differentiating MCI-LB and MCI-AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Pharmacotherapy for most psychiatric conditions was developed from serendipitous observations of benefit from drugs prescribed for different reasons. An algorithmic approach to formulating pharmacotherapy is proposed, based upon which combination of changed activities by brain cell-types is dominant for any particular condition, because those cell-types contain and surrogate for genetic, metabolic and environmental information, that has affected their function. The algorithm performs because functions of some or all the affected cell-types benefit from several available drugs: clemastine, dantrolene, erythropoietin, fingolimod, fluoxetine, lithium, memantine, minocycline, pioglitazone,\u00a0piracetam, and riluzole PROCEDURES/FINDINGS: Bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and post-traumatic stress disorder, illustrate the algorithm; for them, literature reviews show that no single combination of altered cell-types accounts for all cases; but they identify, for each condition, which combination occurs most frequently, i.e., dominates, as compared with other possible combinations. Knowing the dominant combination of altered cell-types in a particular condition, permits formulation of therapy with combinations of drugs taken from the above list. The percentage of patients who might benefit from that therapy, depends upon the frequency with which the dominant combination occurs in patients with that particular condition. Knowing the dominant combination of changed cell types in psychiatric conditions, permits an algorithmically formulated, rationally-based treatment. Different studies of the same condition often produce discrepant results; all might be correct, because identical clinical phenotypes result from different combinations of impaired cell-types, thus producing different results. Clinical trials would validate both the proposed concept and choice of drugs.",

Emblica officinalis (Amla) is widely recognised in the Indian medicinal system for ameliorative effects in managing diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and neurological diseases. Thus, we aimed to identify the active phytoconstituents of E. officinalis and their role in inhibiting the potential targets for the possible treatment of AD. The network pharmacology approach, gene ontology, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) studies were performed. A total of 36 bioactive components in E. officinalis, 95 predicted anti-AD targets, and 3398 AD-related targets were identified from different databases. The network analysis showed that BACE1, ABCB1 and AChE, CA2 are the most potential AD targets. Based on gene ontology and topology analysis results, BACE1 was a significant target related to AD pathways, and quercetin, kaempferol and myricetin showed the highest interaction with target genes. The molecular docking results found that rutin and quercetin displayed better binding affinities -7.5, -5.67\u2009kcal/mol than the BACE1 bound internal ligand. Furthermore, MDS results suggested that quercetin and rutin could be potential inhibitors against BACE-1 protein and may have therapeutic effects in treating AD. Such promising results could be further helpful in new drug discovery against AD.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

The literature has explored the key involvement of miRNAs in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases (NDD), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). The miRNA regulates various signalling pathways; its dysregulation is involved in the pathogenesis of NDD. The present review is focused on the involvement of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of NDD and their role in the treatment or management of NDD. The literature provides comprehensive and cutting-edge knowledge for students studying neurology, researchers, clinical psychologists, practitioners, pathologists, and drug development agencies to comprehend the role of miRNAs in the NDD's pathogenesis, regulation of various genes/signalling pathways, such as \u03b1-synuclein, P53, amyloid-\u03b2, high mobility group protein (HMGB1), and IL-1\u03b2, NMDA receptor signalling, cholinergic signalling, etc. Method: The issues associated with using anti-miRNA therapy are also summarized in this review. The data for this literature were extracted and summarized using various search engines, such as Google Scholar, Pubmed, Scopus, and NCBI using different terms, such as NDD, PD, AD, HD, nanoformulations of mRNA, and role of miRNA in diagnosis and treatment. The miRNAs control various biological actions, such as neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, cytoprotection, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis and chaperone-mediated autophagy, and neurite growth in the central nervous system and diagnosis. Various miRNAs are involved in the regulation of protein aggregation in PD and modulating \u03b2-secretase activity in AD. In HD, mutation in the huntingtin (Htt) protein interferes with Ago1 and Ago2, thus affecting the miRNA biogenesis. Currently, many anti-sense technologies are in the research phase for either inhibiting or promoting the activity of miRNA. This review provides new therapeutic approaches and novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of NDDs by using miRNA.",

Inhibiting AChE is a common strategy for reducing the degradation of neurotransmitter acetylcholine, in order to treat early-stage AD. Therefore, it is crucial to screen and explore AChE inhibitors which are safer and cause fewer side effects. Our research is focused on establishing a platform of ruptured organosilica nanocapsules (RONs) immobilized AChE coupled with an MnO2-OPD colorimetric assay, which could monitor AChE activity and screen AChE inhibitors. The fabricated RONs immobilized AChE possessed excellent pH and thermal stability. Huperzine A was introduced into the established platform to evaluate the inhibition kinetics of the immobilized AChE, which promoted its application in the screening of AChE inhibitors. The satisfactory results of enzyme inhibition kinetics proved the feasibility and applicability of the established method. Thus, the proposed platform was applied to screen AChE inhibitors from 14 compounds isolated from Inula macrophylla, and \u03b2-cyclocostunolide (compound 4) demonstrated the best AChE inhibitory activity among these compounds. This work confirms the existence of chemical components that inhibit AChE activity in Inula macrophylla, and provides a new idea for the application of immobilized enzyme-nanozyme in the field of enzyme inhibitor screening.",

Despite this, there is a dearth of studies examining the correlation between sleep quality and emotional symptoms in the elderly population of China. This study included 496 community elders aged 55 years and older. The participants were divided into two groups based on their scores on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), with 249 being classified as poor sleepers and 247 as good sleepers. All participants were asked to fill out a uniform survey which included details about their demographics, daily habits, and any illnesses they were dealing with. The Self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were employed to measure their levels of anxiety and depression, respectively. In addition, 50 healthy individuals also agreed to brain MR imaging. The finding of our study indicated that those with inadequate sleep had higher levels of depression and anxiety, and the overall anxiety and depression score was linked to the total PSQI score in a positive manner; The MRI subgroup analysis revealed that those with inadequate sleep quality had a greater thickness of the left transverse temporal gyrus (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In addition, a Linear regression analysis of the mediation model showed that poor sleep quality would result in higher scores on the GDS, and cortical thickness in the left transverse temporal gyrus played a fully mediated role in this process. Our research indicates that elderly people in community who have difficulty sleeping may be more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression, and this lack of sleep can result in depressive symptoms due to its impact on the thickness of the left transverse temporal cortex.",

        "AbstractText": "Cranial irradiation (IR) negatively regulates hippocampal neurogenesis and causes cognitive dysfunctions in cancer survivors, especially in pediatric patients. IR decreases proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPC) and consequently diminishes production of new hippocampal neurons. Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, used clinically to improve cognition in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease and dementia. In animal models, memantine acts as a potent enhancer of hippocampal neurogenesis. Memantine was recently proposed as an intervention to improve cognitive impairments occurring after radiotherapy and is currently under investigation in a number of clinical trials, including pediatric patients. To date, preclinical studies investigating the mechanisms underpinning how memantine improves cognition after IR remain limited, especially in the young, developing brain. Here, we investigated whether memantine could restore proliferation in the subgranular zone (SGZ) or rescue the reduction in the number of hippocampal young neurons after IR in the juvenile mouse brain. Mice were whole-brain irradiated with 6 Gy on postnatal day 20 (P20) and subjected to acute or long-term treatment with memantine. Proliferation in the SGZ and the number of young neurons were further evaluated after the treatment. We also measured the levels of neurotrophins associated with memantine improved neural plasticity, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF). We show that acute intraperitoneal treatment with a high, non-clinically used, dose of memantine (50 mg/kg) increased the number of proliferating cells in the intact brain by 72% and prevented 23% of IR-induced decrease in proliferation. Long-term treatment with 10 mg/kg/day of memantine, equivalent to the clinically used dose, did not impact proliferation, neither in the intact brain, nor after IR, but significantly increased the number of young neurons (doublecortin expressing cells) with radial dendrites (29% in sham controls and 156% after IR) and enhanced their dendritic arborization. Finally, we found that long-term treatment with 10 mg/kg/day memantine did not affect the levels of BDNF, but significantly reduced the levels of NGF by 40%. These data suggest that the enhanced dendritic complexity of the hippocampal young neurons after treatment with memantine may contribute to the observed improved cognition in patients treated with cranial radiotherapy.",

We utilized deformation-based morphometry (DBM) in a whole-brain exploratory approach to identify the regional brain volumes associated with gait speed assessed over a short distance during an in-home assessment. We created deformation scores to summarize the gait-associated regions and entered the scores into a series of longitudinal mixed effects models to determine the extent to which deformation predicted change in cognition over time, controlling for associations between gait and cognition. In 438 older adults (81\u2009\u00b1\u20097; 76% female), DBM revealed that slower gait speed was associated with smaller volumes across frontal white matter, temporal grey matter, and subcortical areas and larger volumes in the ventricles during the same testing cycle. When a subset was followed over multiple (5\u2009\u00b1\u20092) years, slower gait speed was also associated with annual declines in global cognition, executive functioning, and memory abilities. Several of the gait-related brain structures were associated with these declines in cognition; however, larger ventricles and smaller medial temporal lobe volumes proved most robust and attenuated the association between slow gait and cognitive decline. Regional brain volumes in the ventricles and temporal lobe associated with both slow gait speed and faster cognitive decline have potential to improve risk stratification for cognitive decline in older adults.",

In early midlife, they also show reduced verbal episodic memory and hippocampal volume. Whether these reductions correlate with a sleep phenotype consistent with insomnia risk remains unexplored. We recruited thirty-one younger middleaged women with risk-reducing early bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), fifteen of whom were taking estradiol-based hormone replacement therapy (BSO+ERT) and sixteen who were not (BSO). Fourteen age-matched premenopausal (AMC) and seventeen spontaneously peri-postmenopausal (SM) women who were ~10y older and not taking ERT were also enrolled. Overnight polysomnography recordings were collected at participants' home across multiple nights (M=2.38 SEM=0.19), along with subjective sleep quality and hot flash ratings. In addition to group comparisons on sleep measures, associations with verbal episodic memory and medial temporal lobe volume were assessed. Increased sleep latency and decreased sleep efficiency were observed on polysomnography recordings of those not taking ERT, consistent with insomnia symptoms. This phenotype was also observed in the older women in SM, implicating ovarian hormone loss. Further, sleep latency was associated with more forgetting on the paragraph recall task, previously shown to be altered in women with early BSO. Both increased sleep latency and reduced sleep efficiency were associated with smaller anterolateral entorhinal cortex volume. Together, these findings confirm an association between ovarian hormone loss and insomnia symptoms, and importantly, identify an younger onset age in women with early ovarian removal, which may contribute to poorer cognitive and brain outcomes in these women.",

However, identifying objective biomarkers that can predict brain stimulation efficacy, remains a challenge. The primary aim of this investigation is to delineate the cerebral regions implicated in AD, taking into account the existing lacuna in comprehension of these regions. In pursuit of this objective, we have employed a supervised machine learning algorithm to prognosticate the neurophysiological outcomes resultant from the confluence of tDCS therapy plus cognitive intervention within both the cohort of responders and non-responders to antecedent tDCS treatment, stratified on the basis of antecedent cognitive outcomes. The data were obtained through an interventional trial. The study recorded high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) in 70\u2009AD patients and analyzed spectral power density during a 6\u2009min resting period with eyes open focusing on a fixed point. The cognitive response was assessed using the AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale. The training process was carried out through a Random Forest classifier, and the dataset was partitioned into K equally-partitioned subsamples. The model was iterated k times using K-1 subsamples as the training bench and the remaining subsample as validation data for testing the model. A clinical discriminating EEG biomarkers (features) was found. The ML model identified four brain regions that best predict the response to tDCS associated with cognitive intervention in AD patients. These regions included the channels: FC1, F8, CP5, Oz, and F7. These findings suggest that resting-state EEG features can provide valuable information on the likelihood of cognitive response to tDCS plus cognitive intervention in AD patients. The identified brain regions may serve as potential biomarkers for predicting treatment response and maybe guide a patient-centered strategy. https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02772185?term=NCT02772185&draw=2&rank=1, identifier ID: NCT02772185.",

Unfortunately, many care recipient/care partner dyads have failed to engage in advance care planning or have lost the opportunity to do so due to the cognitive decline of the care recipient. To address this need, our team created a validated dementia-focused advance care planning tool known as the LEAD Guide (Life-Planning in Early Alzheimer's and Other Dementias). With funding from the National Alzheimer's Association and in consultation with our community advisory board, we developed a preliminary web-based intervention. This intervention integrates the LEAD Guide with self-paced educational modules that lead dyads through conversations and dementia-focused advance care planning processes. In this concept paper, we describe the aims of our funded R01 clinical trial (National Institute on Aging), where we aim to refine our preliminary web-based platform for use in a 5-month mixed-method NIH Stage-1 behavioral intervention. Using a sample of diverse community-based ADRD dyads (n = 60), we aim to: 1) describe the acceptability, usability, and feasibility of the intervention, 2) assess the initial efficacy of the intervention on the primary outcome (decision-making self-efficacy), and secondary outcomes (relationship quality, subjective well-being, anxiety) as perceived by both the care recipient and the care partner, and 3) examine advance care planning congruence as a mechanism of action. The LEAD clinical trial addresses public health challenges by guiding and supporting families through challenging advance care planning conversations, facilitating the transfer of knowledge regarding care preferences and values from the care recipient to the care partner, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life for both individuals with ADRD and their care partners.",

Assessing regional changes in amyloid, particularly in frontoparietal regions, can aid in the early detection of amyloid-related decline in cognitive function.",

The GSH and GR concentrations were the independent variables. Clinical diagnosis and neurocognitive test scores were the dependent variables indicating cognitive status. : The higher the level of GR, the greater the possibility of having normal cognition than of developing Alzheimer's dementia. Additionally, the higher the level of GR, the higher the neurocognitive test scores. However, this association was not significant for GSH. After 6 years, the conversion rate from normal cognition to cognitive impairment was significantly higher in the lower 50th percentile of the GR group than in the upper 50th percentile. : The higher the GR, the lower the prevalence of Alzheimer's dementia and incidence of cognitive impairment and the higher the cognitive test scores. Therefore, GR is a potential protective biomarker against Alzheimer's dementia and cognitive decline.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting el-derly individuals, characterized by cognitive decline and dysfunction in the nervous system. The disease is hallmarked by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid-\u03b2 plaques. Approx-imately 10.7% of the global population aged 65 and above suffer from Alzheimer's disease, and this number is projected to rise significantly in the foreseeable future. By the year 2050, the worldwide prevalence is estimated to reach 139 million cases, compared to the current 55 million cases. The identification of reliable biomarkers that can facilitate the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNA mol-ecules that play a significant role in mRNA regulation and protein level maintenance through mRNA degradation. Over the past decade, researchers have primarily focused on elucidating the functions and expression patterns of miRNAs in various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, to uncover their potential as diagnostic biomarkers. This review emphasizes the potential of miR-NAs as diagnostic biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and explores their roles and therapeutic possibilities. MiRNAs possess several features that make them ideal biomarkers, including their ability to be easily detected in body fluids. Moreover, the extraction process is minimally inva-sive, as miRNAs can be readily extracted. Advances in technology have facilitated the integration of miRNAs into micro-assays, enhancing the reliability and utility of miRNAs as diagnostic bi-omarkers for Alzheimer's disease.",

        "AbstractText": "The neurodegenerative disorders are age-related illnesses that cause the morphology or activity of neurons to deteriorate over time. Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent neurodegenerative illness in the long run. The rate of advancement might vary, even though it is a progressive neurological illness. Various explanations have been proposed, however the true etiology of Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. Most pharmacological interventions are based on the cholinergic theory, that is earliest idea. In accordance with the amyloid hypothesis, the buildup of beta-amyloid in brain regions is the primitive cause of illness. There is no proof that any one strategy is useful in avoiding Alzheimer's disease, though some epidemiological studies have suggested links within various modifiable variables, such as cardiovascular risk, diet and so on. Different metals like zinc, iron, and copper are naturally present in our bodies. In metal chelation therapy drugs are used to jam the metal ions from combining with other molecules in the body. Clioquinol is one of the metal chelation drugs used by researchers. Research on metal chelation is still ongoing. In the present review, we go over the latest developments in prevalence, incidence, etiology, or pathophysiology of our understanding of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, a brief discussion on the development of therapeutic chelating agents and their viability as Alzheimer's disease medication candidates is presented. We also assess the effect of clioquinol as a potential metal chelator.",

In this work, we propose to combine the coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, a powerful detection technology for providing Raman spectra and label-free imaging, with deep learning to distinguish A\u03b2 from non-A\u03b2 regions in AD mice brains in vivo. The 1D CARS spectra is firstly converted to 2D CARS figures by using two different methods: spectral recurrence plot (SRP) and spectral Gramian angular field (SGAF). This can provide more learnable information to the network, improving the classification precision. We then devise a cross-stage attention network (CSAN) that automatically learns the features of A\u03b2 plaques and non-A\u03b2 regions by taking advantage of the computational advances in deep learning. Our algorithm yields higher accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity than the results of conventional multivariate statistical analysis method and 1D CARS spectra combined with deep learning, demonstrating its competence in identifying A\u03b2 plaques. Last but not least, the CSAN framework requires no prior information on the imaging modality and may be applicable to other spectroscopy analytical fields.",

We will conduct an ePCT within an integrated healthcare system and replicate it in an urban academic medical center. At primary care clinics serving about 27,000 patients age 65 and above, we will randomize primary care providers (PCPs) to have their patients with high eRADAR scores receive targeted outreach (intervention) or usual care. Intervention patients will be offered a \"brain health\" assessment visit with a clinical research interventionist mirroring existing roles within the healthcare systems. The interventionist will make follow-up recommendations to PCPs and offer support to newly-diagnosed patients. Patients with high eRADAR scores in both study arms will be followed to identify new diagnoses of dementia in the EHR (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes include healthcare utilization from the EHR and patient, family member and clinician satisfaction assessed through surveys and interviews.

APOE4 increases AD risk up to 12-fold compared to APOE3, an effect that is greater in females. Evidence suggests that one-way APOE could modulate AD risk and progression through neuroinflammation. Indeed, APOE4 is associated with higher glial activation and cytokine levels in AD patients and mice. Therefore, identifying pathways that contribute to APOE4-associated neuroinflammation is an important approach for understanding and treating AD. Human and in vivo evidence suggests that TLR4, one of the key receptors involved in the innate immune system, could be involved in APOE-modulated neuroinflammation. Consistent with that idea, we previously demonstrated that the TLR4 antagonist IAXO-101 can reduce LPS- and A\u03b2-induced cytokine secretion in APOE4 glial cultures. Therefore, the goal of this study was to advance these findings and determine whether IAXO-101 can modulate neuroinflammation, A\u03b2 pathology, and behavior in mice that express APOE4. We used mice that express five familial AD mutations and human APOE3 (E3FAD) or APOE4 (E4FAD). Female and male E4FAD mice and female E3FAD mice were treated with vehicle or IAXO-101 in two treatment paradigms: prevention from 4 to 6\u00a0months of age or reversal from 6 to 7\u00a0months of age. Learning and memory were assessed by modified Morris water maze. A\u03b2 deposition, fibrillar amyloid deposition, astrogliosis, and microgliosis were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Soluble levels of A\u03b2 and apoE, insoluble levels of apoE and A\u03b2, and IL-1\u03b2 were measured by ELISA. IAXO-101 treatment resulted in lower Iba-1 coverage, lower number of reactive microglia, and improved memory in female E4FAD mice in both prevention and reversal paradigms. IAXO-101-treated male E4FAD mice also had lower Iba-1 coverage and reactivity in the RVS paradigm, but there was no effect on behavior. There was also no effect of IAXO-101 treatment on neuroinflammation and behavior in female E3FAD mice.

Resting-state 21-channel EEG was recorded in 148 amyloid-positive AD patients (MCI, n\u2009=\u200988; dementia due to AD, n\u2009=\u200960). Two or more EEG recordings were available for all subjects. We computed whole-brain and regional relative power (i.e., theta (4-8\u00a0Hz), alpha1 (8-10\u00a0Hz), alpha2 (10-13\u00a0Hz), beta (13-30\u00a0Hz)), peak frequency, signal variability (i.e., theta permutation entropy), and functional connectivity values (i.e., alpha and beta corrected amplitude envelope correlation, theta phase lag index, weighted symbolic mutual information, inverted joint permutation entropy). Whole-group linear mixed effects models were used to model the development of EEG measures over time. Group-wise analysis was performed to investigate potential differences in change trajectories between the MCI and dementia subgroups. Finally, we estimated the minimum sample size required to detect different treatment effects (i.e., 50% less deterioration, stabilization, or 50% improvement) on the development of EEG measures over time, in hypothetical clinical trials of 1- or 2-year duration. Whole-group analysis revealed significant regional and global oscillatory slowing over time (i.e., increased relative theta power, decreased beta power), with strongest effects for temporal and parieto-occipital regions. Disease severity at baseline influenced the EEG measures' rates of change, with fastest deterioration reported in MCI patients. Only AD dementia patients displayed a significant decrease of the parieto-occipital peak frequency and theta signal variability over time. We estimate that 2-year trials, focusing on amyloid-positive MCI patients, require 36 subjects per arm (2 arms, 1:1 randomization, 80% power) to detect a stabilizing treatment effect on temporal relative theta power. Resting-state EEG measures could facilitate early detection of treatment effects on neuronal function in AD patients. Their sensitivity depends on the region-of-interest and disease severity of the study population. Conventional spectral measures, particularly recorded from temporal regions, present sensitive AD treatment monitoring markers.",

Genome-wide association analysis in a discovery sample of 31,880 individuals identified 62 unique loci and 785 candidate genes associated with ventricular morphology.

While apolipoprotein E (APOE) is known to modify AD risk, it remains unclear how microglial apoE impacts brain cognition and AD pathology. Here, using conditional mouse models expressing apoE isoforms in microglia and central nervous system-associated macrophages (CAMs), we demonstrate a cell-autonomous effect of apoE3-mediated microglial activation and function, which are negated by apoE4. Expression of apoE3 in microglia/CAMs improves cognitive function, increases microglia surrounding amyloid plaque and reduces amyloid pathology and associated toxicity, whereas apoE4 expression either compromises or has no effects on these outcomes by impairing lipid metabolism. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling reveals increased antigen presentation and interferon pathways upon apoE3 expression. In contrast, apoE4 expression downregulates complement and lysosomal pathways, and promotes stress-related responses. Moreover, in the presence of mouse endogenous apoE, microglial apoE4 exacerbates amyloid pathology. Finally, we observed a reduction in Lgals3-positive responsive microglia surrounding amyloid plaque and an increased accumulation of lipid droplets in APOE4 human brains and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia. Our findings establish critical isoform-dependent effects of microglia/CAM-expressed apoE in brain function and the development of amyloid pathology, providing new insight into how apoE4 vastly increases AD risk.",

We demonstrated that A\u03b2 upregulated NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD, and cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase caspase (caspase 1) expression in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-18 (IL-18) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1). Melatonin prevented inflammasome signaling and excessive cytokine release caused by A\u03b2. We found that ethyl 2[(2-chlorophenyl)(hydroxy) methyl]acrylate (INF-4E, NLRP3 and caspase 1 inhibitor) significantly abolished A\u03b2-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression. The increase in cleaved-caspase 1, pro-IL18, and cleaved-IL18 caused by A\u03b2 suggested the occurrence of pyroptosis, which was further confirmed by the increased expression of N-terminal gasdermin D (N-GSDMD). Melatonin plays a protective role against A\u03b2-induced inflammation via an inflammasome-associated mechanism that is essential in inducing the active forms of cytokines and pyroptosis. The ability of melatonin to inhibit inflammasome may represent a turning point in the treatment of AD progression.",

        "AbstractText": "Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), the strongest risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been revealed to cause greater accumulation of extracellular amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) aggregates than does APOE3 in traditional transgenic mouse models of AD. However, concerns that the overexpression paradigm might have affected the phenotype remain. Amyloid precursor protein (APP)-knock-in (KI) mice, incorporating APP mutations associated with AD development, offer an alternative approach for overproducing pathogenic A\u03b2 without needing overexpression of APP. Here, we present the results of comprehensive analyses of pathological and biochemical traits in the brains of APP-KI mice harboring APP-associated familial AD mutations (APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice) crossed with human APOE-KI mice. Immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses revealed the APOE genotype-dependent increase in A\u03b2 pathology and glial activation, which was evident within 8 months in the mouse model. These results suggested that this mouse model may be valuable for investigating APOE pathobiology within a reasonable experimental time frame. Thus, this model can be considered in investigating the interaction between APOE and A\u03b2 in vivo, which may not be addressed appropriately by using other transgenic mouse models.",

With accumulating evidence suggesting that different A\u03b2 species have varied neurotoxicity and implications in AD development, the discovery of affinity ligands and analytical approaches to selective distinguish, detect, and monitor A\u03b2 becomes an active research area. Remarkable advances have been achieved, which not only promote our understanding of the biophysical chemistry of the protein aggregation during neurodegeneration, but also provide promising tools for early detection of the disease. In view of this, we summarize the recent progress in selective and sensitive approaches for tracking and detection of A\u03b2 species. Specific attentions are given to soluble A\u03b2 oligomers, due to their crucial roles in AD development and occurrence at early stages. The design principle, performance of targeting units, and their cooperative effects with signal reporters for A\u03b2 analysis are discussed. The applications of the novel targeting probes and sensing systems for dynamic monitoring oligomerization, measuring A\u03b2 in biosamples and in vivo imaging in brain are summarized.

        "AbstractText": "Ginsenosides are main active compounds of Panax ginseng with pharmacological effects on immunological/neurological diseases. Recently, ginsenoside-Re (G-Re) has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. However, whether G-Re has an effect on multiple sclerosis (MS), a representative autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), has not been revealed yet. The purpose of this study was to investigate pharmacological effects of G-Re and related molecular mechanisms using a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide-immunized experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model of MS and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated bEND.3 cells as an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). G-Re attenuated motor impairment of EAE, demyelination, and inflammation in spinal cords of EAE mice. G-Re reduced infiltration/activation of microglia/macrophages and decreased mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6), chemokines (MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1, and RANTES), and enzymes (iNOS) in spinal cords of EAE mice. G-Re inhibited alterations of BBB constituents (such as astrocytes, cell adhesion molecule (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1), and tight junctional molecules (occludin and zonula occludens-1)) and toll like receptor 4 (TLR4)/MyD88/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathways in spinal cords of EAE mice and LPS-stimulated bEND.3 cells. Interestingly, combination treatment with G-Re and TLR4 inhibitor (TAK242) significantly inhibited the upregulation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB pathway in LPS-stimulated bEND.3 cells. TLR4 inhibitor- and activator-treated EAE mice showed conflicting behavior patterns. G-Re might alleviate motor impairment of EAE and its pathological/inflammatory events in the spinal cord by preventing BBB disruption via downregulation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. These findings for the first time suggest that G-Re might be a potential therapeutic for MS through maintenance of BBB integrity.",

It exhibits a broad spectrum of biological activities such as anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory, however, its neuroprotective effect in targeting Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains uninvestigated. To provide scientific base for the development of novel AD drug by clarifying the neuroprotective effect and molecular mechanisms of raddeanin A in both in vitro and in vivo AD model. To confirm the neuroprotective role of raddeanin A in the treatment of AD, its mechanisms and effects on \u03b2-amyloidosis and A\u03b2 fibrillation was studied in U87 cells. Besides, the improvement on cognitive deficit, pathological defects, reactive astrocyte clusters, inhibition on neuronal inflammation and apoptosis were further studied in 3 x Tg-AD mice model of AD. Real-time PCR, western blot, dot blot, biolayer interferometry and bioinformatics analysis were used to confirm the in vitro effect and targets of raddeanin A on \u03b2-amyloidosis and its associated protein network. A series of experiments including Morris water maze, H&E staining, nissl staining and immunofluorescence analysis were conducted to confirm the protective behavioral effect of raddeanin A in the in vivo AD mice model. Raddeanin A was identified to reduce \u03b2-amyloidosis in U87 cells and 3 x Tg-AD mice model of AD by decreasing level of BACE1, APP, APP-\u03b2 and A\u03b2. Raddeanin A improved behavioral, spatial memory and learning ability in the AD mice. In the cortex and hippocampus, raddeanin A improved the morphology and arrangement of neurons, lower the level of reactive astrocyte marker GFAP and apoptotic marker proteins Bax/Bcl2 ratio. Moreover, raddeanin A upregulated the mRNA and protein level of Prkc\u03b1 in the hippocampus of AD mice whose neuroprotective effect was exerted possibly via the activation of protein kinase C. As a novel natural agent targeting \u03b2-amyloidosis, our results provide the first evidence of the multiple in vitro and in vivo neuroprotective effect of raddeanin A, suggesting its potential therapeutic application in preventing or alleviating the symptoms of AD.",

Virtual visits were pivotal in providing both scheduled and urgent patient care in addition to in-person care when possible. These virtual visits could have been used to provide urgent medical care than the regular scheduled visits. We hypothesize that regular non-COVID-19-related virtual visits in the evaluated nursing home facilities were lower than COVID-19-related virtual visits during this period. The objective was to compare the frequency of COVID-19-related virtual visits with non-COVID-19-related virtual visits performed in three suburban nursing homes in Michigan from December 2020 through February 2022. Methods: Retrospective chart review of 283 patients, comprising 563 virtual visits. The most frequent ICD-10 diagnostic codes used by providers for primary encounters were analyzed for three participating facilities Results: Only 13.8% (78/563) of all virtual visits during the study period were for COVID-19 as a primary encounter. In total 86.1% (485/563) of visits were non-COVID-19 related, which comprised most frequently M6281 muscle weakness (45), E119 diabetes type with complications (20), NI86 end-stage renal disease (11), N390 urinary tract infection (10), G309 Alzheimer's disease (10), and I4891 unspecified atrial fibrillation (10). Conclusion: We found that the primary ICD-10 diagnosis codes for virtual COVID-19-related visits were significantly lower than non-COVID-19-related virtual visits in our study population.

Differentially expressed lncRNAs in AD were identified through bioinformatics analysis and peripheral blood from thirty AD patients was collected to verify the expression of these lncRNAs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The correlations between lncRNAs and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were assessed by Pearson's correlation analysis. Immunofluorescence (IF), Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry assays were conducted to evaluate the biological effect of ENST00000440246.1 and protein phosphatase 2\u00a0A (PP2A) in SK-N-SH cells.

BPA can be found in epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics, which are frequently used in food storage and baby bottles. However, BPA can bind mainly to estrogen receptors, interfering with various neurologic functions, its use is a topic of significant concern. Nonetheless, the neurotoxicity of BPA has not been fully understood despite numerous investigations on its disruptive effects. Therefore, this review aims to highlight the most recent studies on the implications of BPA on the neurologic system. Our findings suggest that BPA exposure impairs various structural and molecular brain changes, promoting oxidative stress, changing expression levels of several crucial genes and proteins, destructive effects on neurotransmitters, excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation, damaged blood-brain barrier function, neuronal damage, apoptosis effects, disruption of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, increase in reactive oxygen species, promoted apoptosis and intracellular lactate dehydrogenase release, a decrease of axon length, microglial DNA damage, astrogliosis, and significantly reduced myelination. Moreover, BPA exposure increases the risk of developing neurologic diseases, including neurovascular (e.g. stroke) and neurodegenerative (e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's) diseases. Furthermore, epidemiological studies showed that the adverse effects of BPA on neurodevelopment in children contributed to the emergence of serious neurological diseases like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), depression, emotional problems, anxiety, and cognitive disorders. In summary, BPA exposure compromises human health, promoting the development and progression of neurologic disorders.

In contrast, naturally occurring cancer represents the leading cause of death in pet dogs, and specific breeds like the Golden Retriever (GR) carry up to a 65% cancer-related death rate. We hypothesized that GWAS of long-lived GRs might lead to the identification of genetic variants capable of modifying longevity within this cancer-predisposed breed. A GWAS was performed comparing GR dogs\u2009\u2265\u200914\u00a0years to dogs dying prior to age 12 which revealed a significant association to ERBB4, the only member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family capable of serving as both a tumor suppressor gene and an oncogene. No coding variants were identified, however, distinct haplotypes in the 5'UTR were associated with reduced lifespan in two separate populations of GR dogs. When all GR dogs were analyzed together (n\u2009=\u2009304), the presence of haplotype 3 was associated with shorter survival (11.8\u00a0years vs. 12.8\u00a0years, p\u2009=\u20090.024). GRs homozygous for haplotype 3 had the shortest survival, and GRs homozygous for haplotype 1 had the longest survival (11.6\u00a0years vs. 13.5\u00a0years, p\u2009=\u20090.0008). Sub-analyses revealed that the difference in lifespan for GRs carrying at least 1 copy of haplotype 3 was specific to female dogs (p\u2009=\u20090.009), whereas survival remained significantly different in both male and female GRs homozygous for haplotype 1 or haplotype 3 (p\u2009=\u20090.026 and p\u2009=\u20090.009, respectively).

Stronger associations in magnitude were observed among caregivers without caregiving networks (\u03b2 = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.56) and assisting older adults without dementia (\u03b2 = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.06, 1.37). Discussion: Hearing difficulty may contribute to greater caregiving time and remains a potential target for caregiver support programs.",

        "AbstractText": "This study aimed to investigate the influence of the overall Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic architecture on Down syndrome (DS) status, cognitive measures, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. AD polygenic risk scores (PRS) were tested for association with DS-related traits. The AD risk PRS was associated with disease status in several cohorts of sporadic late- and early-onset and familial late-onset AD, but not in familial early-onset AD or DS. On the other hand, lower DS Mental Status Examination memory scores were associated with higher PRS, independent of intellectual disability and APOE (PRS including APOE, PRSAPOE , p\u00a0=\u00a02.84\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-4 ; PRS excluding APOE, PRSnonAPOE , p\u00a0=\u00a01.60\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-2 ). PRSAPOE exhibited significant associations with A\u03b242, tTau, pTau, and A\u03b242/40 ratio in DS. These data indicate that the AD genetic architecture influences cognitive and CSF phenotypes in DS adults, supporting common pathways that influence memory decline in both traits. Examination of the polygenic risk of AD in DS presented here is the first of its kind. AD PRS influences memory aspects in DS individuals, independently of APOE genotype. These results point to an overlap between the genes and pathways that leads to AD and those that influence dementia and memory decline in the DS population. APOE \u03b54 is linked to DS cognitive decline, expanding cognitive insights in adults.",

        "ArticleTitle": "The Role of the Vagus Nerve in the Microbiome and Digestive System in Relation to Epilepsy.",
        "AbstractText": "The Enteric Nervous System (ENS) is described as a division of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS), located within the gut wall and it is formed by two main plexuses: the myenteric plexus (Auerbach's) and the submucosal plexus (Meissner's). The contribution of the ENS to the pathophysiology of various neurological diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease has been described in the literature, while some other studies have found a connection between epilepsy and the gastrointestinal tract. The above could be explained by cholinergic neurons and neurotransmission systems in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses, regulating the vagal excitability effect. It is also understandable, as the discharges arising in the amygdala are transmitted to the intestine through projections the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, giving rise to efferent fibers that stimulate the gastrointestinal tract and consequently the symptoms at this level. Therefore, this review's main objective is to argue in favor of the existing relationship of the ENS with the Central Nervous System (CNS) as a facilitator of epileptogenic or ictogenic mechanisms. The gut microbiota also participates in this interaction; however, it depends on many individual factors of each human being. The link between the ENS and the CNS is a poorly studied epileptogenic site with a big impact on one of the most prevalent neurological conditions such as epilepsy.",

AD patients encounter progressive neurodegenerative dementia associated with behavioural, linguistic, and visuospatial deficits. Although studies on the discovery of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau (the essential elements of plaques and tangles in AD) have shed light on the molecular pathological processes of AD, the exact cause of the condition is still largely unknown. The involvement of various proteins, such as amyloid-\u03b2, prion protein, tau, and \u03b1-synuclein has been linked to AD pathogenesis. The current AD treatments are mainly based on symptomatic management and restoration of neurotransmitters' balance. There is a significant need to develop medications that can alter the underlying disease process and prevent its progression. The present manuscript provides a review of various hypotheses that have been proposed for AD pathogenesis. The manuscript has also explored the development of novel anti-AD drugs based on various pathogenic pathways, which are recently under various clinical trial phases.",

Current research focused on design of Tacrine-Flavone hybrids as multitargeted cholinesterase and monoamine oxidase B inhibitors. A total of 10 Tacrine- Flavone hybrids were designed, synthesized and characterized. The in vitro neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity of the synthesized compounds determined using SHSY5Y cell line and HEPG2 cell line. One most active compound (AF1) with least toxicity in in vitro studies was chosen for in vivo studies. Acute and subacute toxicity of the novel compound AF1 conducted on Wistar rats according to OECD guideline 423 and 407. The LD50 value of the novel compound calculated according to Finney's method using Probit analysis. Anti-Alzheimer's activity studies conducted on male Wistar rats. Behavioral studies conducted and AChE and MAO-B activity determined in rat brain. All the compounds exhibited good inhibitory effect on MAO B and AChE. The neurotoxicity studies of the active compound AF1 did not show toxicity up to 100\u03bcg. The hepatotoxicity study of the most active compound AF1, showed the compound to be safe up to 200\u03bcg. The LD 50 value of the novel compound after a single oral administration was found to be 64 mg/kg bodyweight in rats. Subacute toxicity studies did not show any remarkable toxicity in the vital organs up to 40 mg/kg. Activity studies showed comparable results with standard at 20 mg/kg. The results showed that the novel Tacrine-Flavone hybrids are multitarget-directed ligands, which are safe and active compared to tacrine and can be a promising lead molecule for further study.",

Moreover, nowadays, preclinical and clinical evidence demonstrates that sex and gender can lead to differences in stress responses that predispose males and females to different expressions of similar pathologies. In this curated review, we focus on what is known about sex differences in classic mechanisms of stress response, such as glucocorticoid hormones and corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), which are components of the hypothalamicpituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis. Then, we present sex differences in neurotransmitter levels, such as serotonin, dopamine, glutamate and GABA, as well as indices of neurodegeneration, such as amyloid \u03b2 and Tau. Gonadal hormone effects, such as estrogens and testosterone, are also discussed throughout the review. We also review in detail preclinical data investigating sex differences caused by recentlyrecognized regulators of stress and disease, such as the immune system, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, as well neurosteroids. Finally, we discuss how understanding sex differences in stress responses, as well as in pharmacology, can be leveraged into novel, more efficacious therapeutics for all. Based on the supporting evidence, it is obvious that incorporating sex as a biological variable into preclinical research is imperative for the understanding and treatment of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety and Alzheimer's disease.",

Their intricate structures, however, present significant challenges, limiting our understanding of their functions, regulatory mechanisms, and potential applications in biomedicine and technology. This study evaluated the AlphaFold2 ColabFold method's structure predictions for antimicrobial amyloids, using eight antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including those with experimentally determined structures and AMPs known for their distinct amyloidogenic morphological features. Additionally, two well-known human amyloids, amyloid-\u03b2 and islet amyloid polypeptide, were included in the analysis due to their disease relevance, short sequences, and antimicrobial properties. Amyloids typically exhibit tightly mated \u03b2-strand sheets forming a cross-\u03b2 configuration. However, certain amphipathic \u03b1-helical subunits can also form amyloid fibrils adopting a cross-\u03b1 structure. Some AMPs in the study exhibited a combination of cross-\u03b1 and cross-\u03b2 amyloid fibrils, adding complexity to structure prediction. The results showed that the AlphaFold2 ColabFold models favored \u03b1-helical structures in the tested amyloids, successfully predicting the presence of \u03b1-helical mated sheets and a hydrophobic core resembling the cross-\u03b1 configuration. This implies that the AI-based algorithms prefer assemblies of the monomeric state, which was frequently predicted as helical, or capture an \u03b1-helical membrane-active form of toxic peptides, which is triggered upon interaction with lipid membranes.",

We studied the relation between mid-to-late-life hypertension trends and cerebral white matter injury in community-dwelling individuals from the FHS (Framingham Heart Study). FHS Offspring cohort participants with available mid-life and late-life blood pressure measurements and brain magnetic resonance imaging were included. Multiple regression analyses were used to relate hypertension trends (normotension-normotension [reference], normotension-hypertension, and hypertension-hypertension) to white matter injury metrics on diffusion tensor imaging (free water, fractional anisotropy, and peak skeletonized mean diffusivity) and FLAIR (white matter hyperintensity volume) by different blood pressure cutoffs (130/80, 140/90, and 150/90 mm\u2005Hg). We included 1018 participants (mean age 47.3\u00b17.4 years at mid-life and 73.2\u00b17.3 at late-life). At the 140/90 mm\u2005Hg cutoff, the hypertension-hypertension trend was associated with higher free water (\u03b2, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.03-0.30]; P=0.021) and peak skeletonized mean diffusivity (\u03b2, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.01-0.29]; P=0.033).

The bibliometric analysis was done to reflect the relevance and understanding of KBS in recent literature.\u00a0The SCOPUS database was utilized to conduct a search for all articles with the terms \"Kluver-Bucy\" and \"Kluver Bucy\" from January 1, 1955 (the first available articles from the search) to February 1, 2023. The parameters included in this analysis were article title, citation numbers, citations per year, authors, institutions, publishing journals, country of origin, Source Normalized Impact per Paper, and Scopus CiteScore. Since 1937, when Kluver-Bucy Syndrome was first defined, the publications on KBS have steadily increased, with up to six publications a year in 2002. The most common institutions were SUNY Upstate Medical University, VA Medical Center, and the State University of New York (SUNY) System. Seven of these papers were published in Neurology. Almost 75% of the articles were published in journals of medicine and neuroscience. This is the first bibliometric analysis to evaluate the most influential publications about Kluver-Bucy Syndrome. A majority of the research is case-based and there is a dearth of clinical trials to identify the exact pathophysiology and physiotherapy management, possibly owing to the rarity of the disease. Our research suggests that there may be a significant overlap between Sanfilippo syndrome and KBS, suggesting that refined guidelines for establishing diagnosis may be required for children.

Altered glial phagocytosis has been implicated in several neurological diseases including Alzheimer's disease. To untangle the links between glial phagocytosis and neurodegeneration, we investigated Drosophila mutants lacking the phagocytic receptor Draper. Loss of Draper leads to persistent neuronal cell corpses and age-dependent neurodegeneration. Here we investigate whether the phagocytic defects observed in draper mutants lead to chronic increased immune activation that promotes neurodegeneration. We found that the antimicrobial peptide Attacin-A is highly upregulated in the fat body of aged draper mutants and that the inhibition of the Immune deficiency (Imd) pathway in the glia and fat body of draper mutants led to reduced neurodegeneration. Taken together, these findings indicate that phagocytic defects lead to neurodegeneration via increased immune signaling, both systemically and locally in the brain.",

We propose a factor regression model for data with heterogeneous subpopulations. The proposed model can be represented as a decomposition of heterogeneous and homogeneous terms. The heterogeneous term is driven by latent factors in different subpopulations. The homogeneous term captures common variation in the covariates and shares common regression coefficients across subpopulations. Our proposed model attains a good balance between a global model and a group-specific model. The global model ignores the data heterogeneity, while the group-specific model fits each subgroup separately. We prove the estimation and prediction consistency for our proposed estimators, and show that it has better convergence rates than those of the group-specific and global models. We show that the extra cost of estimating latent factors is asymptotically negligible and the minimax rate is still attainable. We further demonstrate the robustness of our proposed method by studying its prediction error under a mis-specified group-specific model. Finally, we conduct simulation studies and analyze a data set from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and an aggregated microarray data set to further demonstrate the competitiveness and interpretability of our proposed factor regression model.",

Neurotoxicity manifests when exposure to these chemicals disrupts the normal functioning of the nervous system, and some neurotoxic agents have been linked to neurodegenerative pathologies such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The growing concern surrounding the neurotoxic impacts of both naturally occurring and man-made toxic substances necessitates the identification of animal models for rapid testing across a wide spectrum of substances and concentrations, and the utilization of tools capable of detecting nervous system alterations spanning from the molecular level up to the behavioural one. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is gaining prominence in the field of neuroscience due to its versatility. The possibility of analysing all developmental stages (embryo, larva and adult), applying the most common \"omics\" approaches (transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, etc.) and conducting a wide range of behavioural tests makes zebrafish an excellent model for neurotoxicity studies. This review delves into the main experimental approaches adopted and the main markers analysed in neurotoxicity studies in zebrafish, showing that neurotoxic phenomena can be triggered not only by exposure to chemical substances but also by fluctuations in temperature. The findings presented here serve as a valuable resource for the study of neurotoxicity in zebrafish and define new scenarios in ecotoxicology suggesting that alterations in temperature can synergistically compound the neurotoxic effects of chemical substances, intensifying their detrimental impact on fish populations.",

Here, we study the mechanism that controls substrate processing by \u03b3-secretases and A\u03b2 peptide length. We found that polar interactions established by the APPC99 ectodomain (ECD), involving but not limited to its juxtamembrane region, restrain both the extent and degree of \u03b3-secretases processive cleavage by destabilizing enzyme-substrate interactions. We show that increasing hydrophobicity, via mutation or ligand binding, at APPC99 -ECD attenuates substrate-driven product release and rescues the effects of Alzheimer's disease-associated pathogenic \u03b3-secretase and APP variants on A\u03b2 length. In addition, our study reveals that APPC99 -ECD facilitates the paradoxical production of longer A\u03b2s caused by some \u03b3-secretase inhibitors, which act as high-affinity competitors of the substrate. These findings assign a pivotal role to the substrate ECD in the sequential proteolysis by \u03b3-secretases and suggest it as a sweet\u00a0spot for the potential design of APP-targeting compounds selectively promoting its processing by these enzymes.",

Alpha diversity, beta diversity, linear discriminant analysis effect size, analysis of variance-like differential expression analysis and network analysis were used to compare group oral microbiomes. All 29 participants had moderate to severe periodontitis. Group buccal and supragingival samples were indistinguishable, but subgingival samples demonstrated significant alpha and beta diversity differences.

The protein expression level of TTBK1 is elevated in the cortex brain tissues with AD patients compared to the control subjects. We therefore hypothesized that antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) based targeting Ttbk1 could prevent the accumulation of phosphorylated tau, thereby delaying the development of tau pathology in AD. Here we show that in vivo administration of ASO targeting mouse Ttbk1 (ASO-Ttbk1) specifically suppressed the expression of Ttbk1 without affecting Ttbk2 expression in the temporal cortex of PS19 tau transgenic mice. Central administration of ASO-Ttbk1 in PS19 mice significantly reduced the expression level of representative phosphor-tau epitopes relevant to AD at 8\u00a0weeks post-dose, including pT231, pT181, and pS396 in the sarkosyl soluble and insoluble fractions isolated from hippocampal tissues as determined by ELISA and pS422 in soluble fractions as determined by western blotting. Immunofluorescence demonstrated that ASO-Ttbk1 significantly reduced pS422 phosphorylated tau intensity in mossy fibers region of the dentate gyrus in PS19 mice. RNA-sequence analysis of the temporal cortex tissue revealed significant enrichment of interferon-gamma and complement pathways and increased expression of antigen presenting molecules (Cd86, Cd74, and H2-Aa) in PS19 mice treated with ASO-Ttbk1, suggesting its potential effect on microglial phenotype although neurotoxic effect was absent. These data suggest that TTBK1 is an attractive therapeutic target to suppress TTBK1 without compromising TTBK2 expression and pathological tau phosphorylation in the early stages of AD.",

Recent studies have found that VNS can inhibit inflammation, promote neuroprotection, help maintain the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, have multisystemic modulatory effects, and even transmit signals from the gut flora to the brain. In this article, we will review several essential studies that summarize the current theories of VNS and its immunomodulatory effects, as well as the therapeutic value of VNS for brain disorders. By doing so, we aim to provide a better understanding of how the neuroimmune network operates and inspire future research in this field.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Causal relationships between blood lipids and major psychiatric disorders: Univariable and multivariable mendelian randomization analysis.",
        "AbstractText": "Whether the positive associations of blood lipids with psychiatric disorders are causal is uncertain. We conducted this two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to comprehensively investigate associations of blood lipids with psychiatric disorders. Univariable and multivariable models were established for MR analyses. Inverse variance-weighted (IVW) MR was employed as the main approach; weighted median and MR-Egger were used as sensitivity analysis methods. The possibility of violating MR assumptions was evaluated utilizing several sensitivity analyses, including heterogeneity statistics, horizontal pleiotropy statistics, single SNP analysis, leave-one-out analysis and MR-PRESSO analysis. As instrumental variables, we screened 362 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) related to blood lipids from a recent genome-wide association study involving 76,627 individuals of European ancestry, with a genome-wide significance level of p\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910-\u20098. Summary-level information for the six psychiatric disorders was extracted from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium. We observed eight significant associations in univariable MR analysis, four of which were corroborated by multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis modified for the other three lipid traits: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level with the risk of PTSD (OR\u2009=\u20090.91, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.85-0.97, p\u2009=\u20090.002) and AD (OR\u2009=\u20090.79, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.71-0.88, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and triglycerides (TG) level with the risk of MDD (OR\u2009=\u20091.02, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.003-1.03, p\u2009=\u20090.01) and panic disorder (OR\u2009=\u20090.83, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.74-0.92, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In addition, four associations were not significant in MVMR analysis after adjustment for three lipid traits: total cholesterol (TC) level with the risk of PTSD, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level with the risk of MDD and AD and TG level with the risk of AD. Our results show that blood lipids and psychiatric disorders may be related in a causal manner. This shows that abnormal blood lipid levels may act as reliable biomarker of psychiatric disorders and as suitable targets for their prevention and treatment.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Synthesis and evaluation of a novel PET ligand, a GSK'963 analog, aiming at autoradiography and imaging of the receptor interacting protein kinase 1 in the brain.",
        "AbstractText": "Receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a serine/threonine kinase, which regulates programmed cell death and inflammation. Recently, the involvement of RIPK1 in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been reported; RIPK1 is involved in microglia's phenotypic transition to their dysfunctional states, and it is highly expressed in the neurons and microglia in the postmortem brains in AD patients. They prompt neurodegeneration leading to accumulations of pathological proteins in AD. Therefore, regulation of RIPK1 could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AD, and in vivo imaging of RIPK1 may become a useful modality in studies of drug discovery and pathophysiology of AD. The purpose of this study was to develop a suitable radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of RIPK1. (S)-2,2-dimethyl-1-(5-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)propan-1-one (GSK'963) has a high affinity, selectivity for RIPK1, and favorable physiochemical properties based on its chemical structure. In this study, since 11C-labeling (half-life: 20.4 min) GSK'963 retaining its structure requiring the Grignard reaction of tert-butylmagnesium halides and [11C]carbon dioxide was anticipated to give a low yield, we decided instead to 11C-label a GSK'963 analog ((S)-2,2-dimethyl-1-(5-(m-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)propan-1-one, GG502), which has a high RIPK1 inhibitory activity equivalent to that of the original compound GSK'963. Thus, we successfully 11C-labeled GG502 using a Pd-mediated cross-coupling reaction in favorable yields (3.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9%) and radiochemical purities (>\u200996%), and molar activity (47-115 GBq/\u03bcmol). On autoradiography, radioactivity accumulation was observed for [11C]GG502 and decreased by non-radioactive GG502 in the mouse spleen and human brain, indicating the possibility of specific binding of this ligand to RIPK1. On brain PET imaging in a rhesus monkey, [11C]GG502 showed a good brain permeability (peak standardized uptake value (SUV)\u2009~3.0), although there was no clear evidence of specific binding of [11C]GG502. On brain PET imaging in acute inflammation model rats, [11C]GG502 also showed a good brain permeability, and no significant increased uptake was observed in the lipopolysaccharide-treated side of striatum. On metabolite analysis in rats at 30 min after administration of [11C]GG502,\u2009~55% and\u2009~10% of radioactivity was from unmetabolized [11C]GG502 in the brain and the plasma, respectively. We synthesized and evaluated a 11C-labeled PET ligand based on the methylated analog of GSK'963 for imaging of RIPK1 in the brain. Although in autoradiography of the resulting [11C]GG502 indicated the possibility of specific binding, the actual PET imaging failed to detect any evidence of specific binding to RIPK1 despite its good brain permeability. Further development of radioligands with a higher binding affinity for RIPK1 in vivo and more stable metabolite profiles compared with the current compound may be required.",

To identify PrPSc aggregates for diagnostic purposes, pathologists use\u00a0immunohistochemical staining of prion protein antibodies on tissue samples. With digital pathology, artificial intelligence can now analyze stained slides. In this study, we developed an automated pipeline for the identification of PrPSc aggregates in tissue samples from the cerebellar and occipital cortex.

We used two strategies: a deep learning segmentation approach using a vision transformer, and a machine learning classification approach with traditional classifiers. Our method was developed and tested on 64 whole slide images from 41 patients definitively diagnosed with prion disease. The results of our study demonstrated that our proposed framework can accurately classify WSIs from a blind test set. Moreover, it can quantify PrPSc distribution and localization throughout the brain. This could potentially be extended to evaluate\u00a0protein expression\u00a0in other neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia. It is known that women with one ApoE4 allele display greater risk and earlier onset of AD compared with men. In mice, we previously showed that follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a gonadotropin that rises in post-menopausal females, activates its receptor FSHR in the hippocampus, to drive AD-like pathology and cognitive impairment. Here we show in mice that ApoE4 and FSH jointly trigger AD-like pathogenesis by activating C/EBP\u03b2/\u03b4-secretase signaling. ApoE4 and FSH additively activate C/EBP\u03b2/\u03b4-secretase pathway that mediates APP and Tau proteolytic fragmentation, stimulating A\u03b2 and neurofibrillary tangles. Ovariectomy-provoked AD-like pathologies and cognitive defects in female ApoE4-TR mice are ameliorated by anti-FSH\u00a0antibody treatment. FSH administration facilitates AD-like pathologies in both young male and female ApoE4-TR mice. Furthermore, FSH stimulates AD-like pathologies and cognitive defects in ApoE4-TR mice, but not ApoE3-TR mice.

Yet, CI/ADRD is often undetected and underdiagnosed within primary care settings, and in health disparate populations. The MyCog paradigm is an iPad-based, self-administered, validated cognitive assessment based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Cognition Battery and coupled with clinician decision-support tools that is specifically tailored for CI/ADRD detection within diverse, primary care settings. We will conduct a two-arm, primary care practice-randomised (N=24 practices; 45 257 active patients at the proposed practices), pragmatic trial among geographically diverse Oak Street Health sites to test the effectiveness of the MyCog paradigm to improve early detection CI/ADRD among low socioeconomic, black and Hispanic older adults compared with usual care. Participating practices randomised to the intervention arm will impart the MyCog paradigm as a new standard of care over a 3-year implementation period; as the cognitive component for Annual Wellness Visits and for any patient/informant-reported or healthcare provider-suspected cognitive concern. Rates of detected (cognitive test suggesting impairment) and/or diagnosed (relevant International Classification of Diseases-9/10 [ICD-9/10] code) cognitive deficits, impairments or dementias including ADRD will be our primary outcome of study compared between arms. Secondary outcomes will include ADRD severity (ie, mild or later stage), rates of cognitive-related referrals and rates of family member or caregiver involvement in ADRD care planning. We will use generalised linear mixed models to account for clustered study design. Secondary models will adjust for subject, clinic or visit-specific characteristics. We will use mixed-methods approaches to examine fidelity and cost-effectiveness of the MyCog paradigm. The Institutional Review Board at Advarra has approved the study protocol (Pro00064339).

Plasma phosphorylated tau proteins (p-tau) have shown potential as such biomarkers. This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines and aimed to determine whether quantification of plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181), threonine 217 (p-tau217) and threonine 231 (p-tau231) is informative in the diagnosis of AD. All p-tau isoforms increase as a function of A\u03b2-accumulation and discriminate healthy individuals from those at preclinical AD stages with high accuracy. P-tau231 increases earliest, followed by p-tau181 and p-tau217. In advanced stages, all p-tau isoforms are associated with the clinical classification of AD and increase with disease severity, with the greatest increase seen for p-tau217. This is also reflected by a better correlation of p-tau217 with A\u03b2 scans, whereas both, p-tau217 and p-tau181 correlated equally with tau scans. However, at the very advanced stages, p-tau181 begins to plateau, which may mirror the trajectory of the A\u03b2 pathology and indicate an association with a more intermediate risk of AD. Across the AD continuum, the incremental increase in all biomarkers is associated with structural changes in widespread brain regions and underlying cognitive decline. Furthermore, all isoforms differentiate AD from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders, making them specific for AD. Incorporating p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231 in clinical use requires further studies to examine ideal cut-points and harmonize assays.",

Hazard ratios (HR) were pooled using a random-effect model, and a p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 5 studies with 125649 patients (30192 in the CA group and 95457 in the non-CA group) were included. The mean age of patients among CA and non-CA groups was comparable (58.7 vs. 58.18). The most common comorbidity among CA and non-CA groups was hypertension (18.49% vs. 81.51%) respectively. Pooled analysis of primary outcome showed that CA was associated with significant reduction in the risk of Dementia (HR, 0.63(95%CI: 0.52-0.77), P<0.001). Similarly, pooled analysis of secondary outcomes showed that the patients with CA had a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (HR, 0.78(95%CI: 0.66-0.92), P<0.001) compared with the non-CA group. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of vascular dementia (HR, 0.63 (95%CI: 0.38-1.06), P=0.08) between both groups of patients.

Tau seeding may underlie its predictable spread in these diseases. Molecular chaperones can modulate tau pathology, but their effects have mainly been studied in isolation. This study employed a semi-high throughput assay to identify molecular chaperones influencing tau seeding using Tau RD P301S FRET Biosensor cells, which express a portion of tau containing the frontotemporal dementia-related P301S tau mutation fused to a FRET biosensor. Approximately fifty chaperones from five major families were screened using live cell imaging to monitor FRET-positive tau seeding. Among the tested chaperones, five exhibited significant effects on tau in the primary screen. Notably, three of these were from the DnaJ family. In subsequent studies, overexpression of DnaJA2, DnaJB1, and DnaJB6b resulted in significant reductions in tau levels. Knockdown experiments by shRNA revealed an inverse correlation between DnaJB1 and DnaJB6b with tau levels. DnaJB6b overexpression, specifically, reduced total tau levels in a cellular model with a pre-existing pool of tau, partially through enhanced proteasomal degradation. Further, DnaJB6b interacted with tau complexes. These findings highlight the potent chaperone activity within the DnaJ family, particularly DnaJB6b, towards tau.",

Aluminum is a neurotoxin inducer for cognitive impairments associated with AD. The treatment approaches for AD are unsatisfactory. Boswellia papyrifera and Syzygium aromaticum are known for their pharmacological assets, including antioxidant activity. Therefore, the current study explored the possible mitigating effects of a combination of Boswellia papyrifera and Syzygium aromaticum against aluminum chloride (AlCl3) induced AD. The AD model was established using AlCl3 (100 mg/kg), and the rats were orally administrated with Boswellia papyrifera or Syzygium aromaticum or a combination of them daily for 8 weeks. The Y-maze test was used to test cognition in the rats, while acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and oxidative stress markers were estimated in homogenates of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Also, the histopathological examination of the cortex and hippocampus were investigated. The results revealed that administration of either B. papyrifera or S. aromaticum extracts significantly improved the cognitive functions of AD rats, enhanced AChE levels, increased oxidative enzymes levels, including SOD and GSH, and reduced MDA levels in homogenates of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and confirmed by improvement in histological examination. However, using a combination therapy gave better results compared to a single treatment. In conclusion, the present study provided primary evidence for using a combination of B. papyrifera and S. aromaticum to treat cognitive dysfunction associated with AlCl3 Induced AD by improving the AChE levels and modulating oxidative stress in the brain.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disorder characterized by cognitive dysfunction and BDNF/TrkB is a well-conceived anti-AD signaling. Cynomorium songaricum Rupr. (C. songaricum) is a herb with promising neuroprotective effects and the function is majorly attributed to flavonoids. The current study attempted to explore the effects of total flavonoids of C. songaricum (CS) on AD model by focusing on changes in BDNF/TrkB axis. AD model was induced in rats via transcranial injection of A\u03b21-42 and AD symptoms treated with CS of three doses. Donepezil was used as the positive control. Changes in rat memory and learning abilities, brain histological, apoptosis, production of neurotransmitters, BDNF/TrkB axis, and apoptosis-related markers were measured. The injection of A\u03b21-42 induced cognitive dysfunction in AD rats. The integrity of brain tissue structure was destructed and apoptosis was induced in AD rats, in which was found the increased production of AChE and A\u03b21-42, and decreased production of ChAT, ACH. At the molecular level, the expression of BDNF, TrkB, and Bcl-2 was suppressed, while the expression of Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 was induced. After the administration of CS, the memory and learning abilities of rats were improved, the production of neurotransmitter was restored, ordered arrangement of pyramidal cells was retained, and neuron apoptosis was inhibited. The attenuation of A\u03b21-42-indcued impairments was associated with the activation of BDNF/TrkB axis and blockade of apoptosis-related pathways. Collectively, CS can improve learning and memory abilities in A\u03b21-42-induced AD model rats. which may depend on the activation of the hippocampal BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway.",

        "AbstractText": "Cell death is a fundamental physiological process in all living organisms. Processes such as embryonic development, organ formation, tissue growth, organismal immunity, and drug response are accompanied by cell death. In recent years with the development of electron microscopy as well as biological techniques, especially the discovery of novel death modes such as ferroptosis, cuprotosis, alkaliptosis, oxeiptosis, and disulfidptosis, researchers have been promoted to have a deeper understanding of cell death modes. In this systematic review, we examined the current understanding of modes of cell death, including the recently discovered novel death modes. Our analysis highlights the common and unique pathways of these death modes, as well as their impact on surrounding cells and the organism as a whole. Our aim was to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on cell death, with a focus on identifying gaps in our knowledge and opportunities for future investigation. We also presented a new insight for macroscopic intracellular survival patterns, namely that intracellular molecular homeostasis is central to the balance of different cell death modes, and this viewpoint can be well justified by the signaling crosstalk of different death modes. These concepts can facilitate the future research about cell death in clinical diagnosis, drug development, and therapeutic modalities.",

        "AbstractText": "Neurological disorders pose significant challenges in terms of treatment options, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic approaches. Trigonelline, a naturally occurring alkaloid found in various plants, has emerged as a potential treatment option. It has also been reported that trigonelline is involved in several pathways like; Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant, Inflammatory, Neuroprotection and Neurotrophic, Mitochondrial Function and Energy Metabolism. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic potential of trigonelline for diverse neurological disorders using a molecular docking approach. Molecular docking simulations were performed to predict the binding affinity and interaction between trigonelline and target proteins implicated in neurological disorders. The structural requirements for effective binding were also explored. The molecular docking results revealed strong binding interactions and favorable binding affinities between trigonelline and the target proteins involved in diverse neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and depression etc. The predicted binding modes provided insights into the key molecular interactions governing the ligand-protein complexes. The findings suggest that trigonelline holds promise as a therapeutic approach for several neurological disorders. The molecular docking approach employed in this study provides a valuable tool for rational drug design and optimization of trigonelline-based compounds. Further experimental validation and preclinical studies are warranted to confirm the efficacy and safety of trigonelline as a potential treatment option, paving the way for the development of more effective and targeted therapies for neurological disorders.",

        "AbstractText": "Lymphatic system defects are involved in a wide range of diseases, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Fluid return through the lymphatic vascular system is primarily provided by contractions of muscle cells in the walls of lymphatic vessels, which are in turn driven by electrochemical oscillations that cause rhythmic action potentials and associated surges in intracellular calcium ion concentration. There is an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms involved in these repeated events, restricting the development of pharmacological treatments for dysfunction. Previously, we proposed a model where autonomous oscillations in the membrane potential (M-clock) drove passive oscillations in the calcium concentration (C-clock). In this paper, to model more accurately what is known about the underlying physiology, we extend this model to the case where the M-clock and the C-clock oscillators are both active but coupled together, thus both driving the action potentials. This extension results from modifications to the model's description of the IP3 receptor, a key C-clock mechanism. The synchronised dual-driving clock behaviour enables the model to match IP3 receptor knock-out data, thus resolving an issue with previous models. We also use phase-plane analysis to explain the mechanisms of coupling of the dual clocks. The model has the potential to help determine mechanisms and find targets for pharmacological treatment of some causes of lymphoedema.",

        "AbstractText": "Hippocampal hyperexcitability is a promising therapeutic target to prevent A\u03b2 deposition in AD since enhanced neuronal activity promotes presynaptic A\u03b2 production and release. This article highlights the potential application of perampanel (PER), an AMPA receptor (AMPAR) antagonist approved for partial seizures, as a therapeutic agent for AD. Using transgenic AD mice combined with in\u00a0vivo brain microdialysis and primary neurons under oligomeric A\u03b2-evoked neuronal hyperexcitability, the acute effects of PER on A\u03b2 metabolism were investigated. A single oral administration of PER rapidly decreased ISF A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels in the hippocampus of J20, APP transgenic mice, without affecting the A\u03b240 /A\u03b242 ratio; 5\u2009mg/kg PER resulted in declines of 20% and 31%, respectively. Moreover, PER-treated J20 manifested a marked decrease in hippocampal APP \u03b2CTF levels with increased FL-APP levels. Consistently, acute treatment of PER reduced sAPP\u03b2 levels, a direct byproduct of \u03b2-cleavage of APP, released to the medium in primary neuronal cultures under oligomeric A\u03b2-induced neuronal hyperexcitability. To further evaluate the effect of PER on ISF A\u03b2 clearance, a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor was administered to J20 1\u2009h after PER treatment. PER did not influence the elimination of ISF A\u03b2, indicating that the acute effect of PER is predominantly on A\u03b2 production. In conclusion, acute treatment of PER reduces A\u03b2 production by suppressing \u03b2-cleavage of amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein effectively, indicating a potential effect of PER against A\u03b2 pathology in AD.",

We analyzed MRI scans to define the sporadic EOAD-signature atrophy in a small sample (n\u00a0=\u00a025) of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) EOAD patients, investigated its reproducibility in the large longitudinal early-onset Alzheimer's disease study (LEADS) sample (n\u00a0=\u00a0211), and investigated the relationship of the magnitude of atrophy with cognitive impairment. The EOAD-signature atrophy was replicated across the two cohorts, with prominent atrophy in the caudal lateral temporal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and posterior cingulate and precuneus cortices, and with relative sparing of the medial temporal lobe. The magnitude of EOAD-signature atrophy was associated with the severity of cognitive impairment. The EOAD-signature atrophy is a reliable and clinically valid biomarker of AD-related neurodegeneration that could be used in clinical trials for EOAD. We developed an early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD)-signature of atrophy based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. EOAD signature was robustly reproducible across two independent patient cohorts. EOAD signature included prominent atrophy in parietal and posterior temporal cortex.

        "AbstractText": "Dementia is one of today's greatest public health challenges. Its high socio-economic impact and difficulties in diagnosis and treatment are of increasing concern to an aging world population. In recent years, the study of the relationship between gut microbiota and different neurocognitive disorders has gained a considerable interest. Several studies have reported associations between gut microbiota dysbiosis and some types of dementia. Probiotics have been suggested to restore dysbiosis and to improve neurocognitive symptomatology in these dementias. Based on these previous findings, the available scientific evidence on the gut microbiota in humans affected by the most prevalent dementias, as well as the probiotic trials conducted in these patients in recent years, have been here reviewed. Decreased concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and other bacterial metabolites appear to play a major role in the onset of neurocognitive symptoms in Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease dementia (PDD). Increased abundance of proinflammatory taxa could be closely related to the more severe clinical symptoms in both, as well as in Lewy Bodies dementia. Important lack of information was noted in Frontotemporal dementia behavioral variant. Moreover, geographical differences in the composition of the gut microbiota have been reported in AD. Some potential beneficial effects of probiotics in AD and PDD have been reported. However, due to the controversial results further investigations are clearly necessary.",

        "AbstractText": "GPCRs are a family of transmembrane receptors that are profoundly linked to various neurological disorders, among which is Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is the second most ubiquitous neurological disorder after Alzheimer's disease, characterized by the depletion of dopamine in the central nervous system due to the impairment of dopaminergic neurons, leading to involuntary movements or dyskinesia. The current standard of care for PD is Levodopa, a dopamine precursor, yet the chronic use of this agent can exacerbate motor symptoms. Recent studies have investigated the effects of combining A2AR antagonist and 5-HT1A agonist on dyskinesia and motor complications in animal models of PD. It has been proved that the drug combination has significantly improved involuntary movements while maintaining motor activity, highlighting as a result new lines of therapy for PD treatments, through the regulation of both receptors. Using a combination of ligand-based pharmacophore modelling, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics simulation, this study intends on identifying potential dual-target compounds from IBScreen. Results showed that the selected models displayed good enrichment metrics with a near perfect receiver operator characteristic (ROC) and Area under the accumulation curve (AUAC) values, signifying that the models are both specific and sensitive. Molecular docking and ADMET analysis revealed that STOCK2N-00171 could be potentially active against A2AR and 5-HT1A. Post-MD analysis confirmed that the ligand exhibits a stable behavior throughout the simulation while maintaining crucial interactions. These results imply that STOCK2N-00171 can serve as a blueprint for the design of novel and effective dual-acting ligands targeting A2AR and 5-HT1A.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

        "AbstractText": "With the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis (ACH) largely discredited, the ACH2.0 theory of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been recently introduced. Within the framework of the ACH2.0, AD is triggered by amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor (A\u03b2PP)-derived intraneuronal A\u03b2 (iA\u03b2) and is driven by iA\u03b2 produced in the A\u03b2PP-independent pathway and retained intraneuronally. In this paradigm, the depletion of extracellular A\u03b2 or suppression of A\u03b2 production by A\u03b2PP proteolysis, the two sources of A\u03b2PP-derived iA\u03b2, would be futile in symptomatic AD, due to its reliance on iA\u03b2 generated independently of A\u03b2PP, but effective in preventing AD and treating Aging-Associated Cognitive Decline (AACD) driven, in the ACH2.0 framework, by A\u03b2PP-derived iA\u03b2. The observed effect of lecanemab and donanemab, interpreted in the ACH2.0 perspective, supports this notion and mandates AD-preventive clinical trials. Such trials are currently in progress. They are likely, however, to fail or to yield deceptive results if conducted conventionally. The present study considers concepts of design of clinical trials of lecanemab, donanemab, or any other drug, targeting the influx of A\u03b2PP-derived iA\u03b2, in prevention of AD and treatment of AACD. It analyzes possible outcomes and explains why selection of high-risk asymptomatic participants seems reasonable but is not. It argues that outcomes of such AD preventive trials could be grossly misleading, discusses inevitable potential problems, and proposes feasible solutions. It advocates the initial evaluation of this type of drugs in clinical trials for treatment of AACD. Whereas AD protective trials of these drugs are potentially of an impractical length, AACD clinical trials are expected to yield unequivocal results within a relatively short duration. Moreover, success of the latter, in addition to its intrinsic value, would constitute a proof of concept for the former. Furthermore, this study introduces concepts of the active versus passive iA\u03b2 depletion, contends that targeted degradation of iA\u03b2 is the best therapeutic strategy for both prevention and treatment of AD and AACD, proposes potential iA\u03b2-degrading drugs, and describes their feasible and unambiguous evaluation in clinical trials.",

We included 1,514 cases from three cohorts, ADNI, AIBL, and DELCODE, spanning the range from cognitively normal people to people with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We used generalized Bayesian mixed effects analysis of linear and polynomial models of amyloid and volume effects in time. Robustness of effects across cohorts was determined using Bayesian random effects meta-analysis. We found a consistent effect of amyloid and hippocampus volume, but not of basal forebrain volume, on rates of memory change across the three cohorts in the meta-analysis. Effects for amyloid and volumetric markers on executive function were more heterogeneous. We found practice effects in memory and executive performance in amyloid negative cognitively normal controls and MCI cases, but only to a smaller degree in amyloid positive controls and not at all in amyloid positive MCI cases.

Also, we aimed to investigate whether TgF344-AD rats exhibit signs of asymmetry in hemispheric neurodegeneration, similar to what is reported in spatially disoriented AD patients. Finally, we sought to examine how spatial disorientation correlates with working memory performance. TgF344-AD rats were divided into two groups balanced by sex and genotype. The first group underwent the delayed match-to-sample (DMS) task for the assessment of spatial orientation and working memory, while the second group underwent positron emission tomography (PET) for the assessment of glucose metabolism and microglial activity as in-vivo markers of neurodegeneration. Rats were 13 months old during DMS training and 14-16 months old during DMS testing and PET. In the DMS task, TgF344-AD rats were more likely than their wild-type littermates to display strong preference for one of the two levers, preventing working memory testing. Rats without lever-preference showed similar working memory, regardless of their genotype. PET revealed hemispherically asymmetric clusters of increased microglial activity and altered glucose metabolism in TgF344-AD rats.

Deciphering the mechanisms which cause the differential manifestation of the disease across different regions has the potential to help early diagnosis. We aimed to identify common and unique endotypes and their regulation in tangle-free neurons in sporadic AD (SAD) across six brain regions: entorhinal cortex (EC), hippocampus (HC), medial temporal gyrus (MTG), posterior cingulate (PC), superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and visual cortex (VCX). To decipher the states of tangle-free neurons across different brain regions in human subjects afflicted with AD, we performed analysis of the neural transcriptome. We explored changes in differential gene expression, functional and transcription factor target enrichment, and co-expression gene module detection analysis to discern disease-state transcriptomic variances and characterize endotypes. Additionally, we compared our results to tangled AD neuron microarray-based study and the Allen Brain Atlas. We identified impaired neuron function in EC, MTG, PC, and VCX resulting from REST activation and reversal of mature neurons to a precursor-like state in EC, MTG, and SFG linked to SOX2 activation. Additionally, decreased neuron function and increased dedifferentiation were linked to the activation of SUZ12. Energetic deficit connected to NRF1 inactivation was found in HC, PC, and VCX.

Although driving has been shown to be associated with traditional imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, it is possible that some biomarkers have stronger associations with specific aspects of driving behavior. Furthermore, associations between newer plasma biomarkers and driving behaviors are unknown. This study assessed the extent to which individual plasma, imaging, and CSF biomarkers are related to specific driving behaviors and cognitive functions among cognitively normal older adults. We analyzed naturalistic driving behavior from cognitively healthy older drivers (N\u200a=\u200a167, 47% female, mean age\u200a=\u200a73.3 years). All participants had driving, clinical, and demographic data and completed biomarker testing, including imaging, CSF, and/or plasma, within two years of study commencement. AD biomarkers were associated with different characteristics of driving and cognitive functioning within the same individuals. Elevated levels of plasma A\u03b240 were associated with more speeding incidents, higher levels of CSF tau were related to shorter duration of trips, and higher CSF neurofilament light chain values were associated with traveling shorter distances, smaller radius of gyration, and fewer trips at night. We demonstrated that plasma, like CSF and imaging biomarkers, were helpful in predicting everyday driving behaviors. These findings suggest that different biomarkers offer complementary information with respect to driving behaviors.

        "AbstractText": "The Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) is a commonly used measure of verbal fluency. While a normal decline in verbal fluency occurs in late adulthood, significant impairments may indicate brain injury or diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Normative data is essential to identify when test performance falls below expected levels based on age, gender, and education level. This study aimed to establish normative performance data on single-letter COWAT for older community-dwelling adults. Over 19,000 healthy men and women, without a diagnosis of dementia or a Modified Mini-Mental State Examination score below 77/100, were recruited for the ASPREE trial. Neuropsychological assessments, including the COWAT with letter F, were administered at study entry. Median participant age was 75 years (range 65-98), with 56.5% being women. The majority of participants had 9-11 years of education in Australia and over 12 years in the U.S. The COWAT performance varied across ethno-racial groups and normative data were thus presented separately for 16,335 white Australians, 1,084 white Americans, 896 African-Americans, and 316 Hispanic/Latinos. Women generally outperformed men in the COWAT, except for Hispanic/Latinos. Higher education levels consistently correlated with better COWAT performance across all groups, while the negative association with age was weaker. This study provides comprehensive normative data for the COWAT stratified by ethno-racial groups in Australia and the U.S., considering age, gender, and education level. These norms can serve as reference standards for screening cognitive impairments in older adults in both clinical and research settings.",

        "AbstractText": "Zagotenemab (LY3303560), a monoclonal antibody, preferentially binds to extracellular, misfolded, aggregated tau that has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The goal of this study was to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of zagotenemab in participants with AD. This was a Phase Ib, multi-site, participant- and investigator-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in participants with mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild to moderate AD. After screening, participants were randomized to zagotenemab 70\u200amg, 210\u200amg, or placebo every 4 weeks for up to 49 weeks and were followed up for 16 weeks. A total of 13 males and 9 females, aged 59 to 84 years, were dosed. No deaths occurred during this study. A total of 4 serious adverse events occurred in 2 participants who then discontinued the study. The most commonly reported (3 or more participants) treatment-emergent adverse events were sinus bradycardia, headache, fall, and bronchitis. The pharmacokinetics profile showed generally linear exposures across the dose range studied with a clearance of ~8 mL/h. The half-life of zagotenemab in serum was ~20 days. A dose-dependent increase in plasma tau was observed. No other significant pharmacodynamic differences were observed due to low dose levels and limited treatment duration. No dose-limiting adverse events were observed with zagotenemab treatment. Pharmacokinetics of zagotenemab were typical for a monoclonal antibody. Meaningful pharmacodynamic differences were not observed.Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03019536.",

        "AbstractText": "Dementia currently affects more than 55 million people worldwide, and scientists predict that this number will continue to rise. The most common form is Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is triggered, among other things, by dysfunctional cells in the human brain. Stem cell research attempts to counteract neurodegenerative processes, for example by replacing or treating diseased cells. In addition to human embryonic stem cells, since the successes of Takahashi and Yamanaka in 2006, there has been an increased focus on human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS cells). These cells avoid ethically challenging questions about the moral status of human embryos, but there are numerous problems, such as high production costs, side effects from the reprogramming process, or a potentially new moral status. These ethical issues will be examined primarily in relation to AD. The first part will be a discussion of hiPS cells and their importance for stem cell research, after which the focus turns to AD. Based on scientific studies, the relationship between hiPS cells and AD will be outlined as well as ethical implications presented. While potential limitations of hiPS cells have been discussed by numerous authors, an ethical perspective on the link between hiPS cells and AD seems to be neglected in the scientific community. The following risk analysis aims to identify a possible research agenda. In conclusion, the focus on individuals with AD may help to adopt an ethical stance that recognizes existing limitations and constructively engages with the possibilities of research.",

        "AbstractText": "There is an expanding body of literature implicating heart disease and stroke as risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hawaii is one of the six majority-minority states in the United States and has significant racial health disparities. The Native-Hawaiians/Pacific-Islander (NHPI) population is well-known as a high-risk group for a variety of disease conditions. We explored the association of cardiovascular disease with AD development based on the Hawaii Medicare data, focusing on racial disparities. We utilized nine years of Hawaii Medicare data to identify subjects who developed heart failure (HF), ischemic heart disease (IHD), atrial fibrillation (AF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, and progressed to AD, using multistate models. Propensity score-matched controls without cardiovascular disease were identified to compare the risk of AD after heart disease and stroke. Racial/Ethnic differences in progression to AD were evaluated, accounting for other risk factors. We found increased risks of AD for AF, HF, IHD, and stroke. Socioeconomic (SE) status was found to be critical to AD risk. Among the low SE group, increased AD risks were found in NHPIs compared to Asians for all conditions selected and compared to whites for HF, IHD, and stroke. Interestingly, these observations were found reversed in the higher SE group, showing reduced AD risks for NHPIs compared to whites for AF, HF, and IHD, and to Asians for HF and IHD. NHPIs with poor SE status seems to be mostly disadvantaged by the heart/stroke and AD association compared to corresponding whites and Asians.",

However, specific mechanisms underlying this association remain undeciphered, and immune-related processes are purported to play a signifcant role. The accrual of publicly available transcriptomic datasets permits secondary analysis and the application of data-mining and bioinformatic tools for biological discovery. Aim: The present study aimed to leverage publicly available transcriptomic datasets and databases, and apply a series of bioinformatic analysis to identify a robust signature of immune-related signature of PD and AD linkage. Methods: We downloaded gene-expresssion data pertaining PD and AD and identified crosstalk genes. We constructed a protein-protein network analysis, applied immune cell enrichment analysis, and predicted crosstalk immune-related genes and infiltrating immune cells. Next, we applied consisent cluster analysis and performed immune cell bias analysis, followed by LASSO regression to select biomarker immune-related genes. Results: The results showed a 3 gene set comprising of DUSP14, F13A1 and SELE as a robust immune-related signature. Macrophages M2 and NKT, B-cells, CD4+ memory T-cells and CD8+ naive T-cells emerged as key immune cells linking PD with AD. Conclusion: Candidate immune-related biomarker genes and immune cells central to the assocation of PD with AD were identified, and merit investigation in experimental and clinical research.",

The accumulation of Amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) leads to an active environment during the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A\u03b2 is also present in glioma tissues; however, the biological and translational implications of A\u03b2 in glioma are elusive. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis and Cox regression analysis on a cohort of 79 patients from our institution were performed to investigate the association between A\u03b2 and the malignancy of glioma. Subsequently, the potential of oligomer-A\u03b242 (OA\u03b242) to inhibit glioma growth was investigated in vivo and in vitro. Immunofluorescence staining and phagocytosis assays were performed to evaluate the activation of microglia. Finally, RNA-seq was utilized to identify the predominant signaling involved in this process and in vitro studies were performed to validate them. A positive correlation between A\u03b2 and a favorable prognosis was observed in glioma. Furthermore, OA\u03b242 suppressed glioma growth by enhancing the phagocytic activity of microglia. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) secreted by OA\u03b242-activated microglia was essential in the engulfment process. Our study proved an anti-glioma effect of A\u03b2, and microglia could serve as a cellular target for treating glioma with OA\u03b242.",

The aim of this study is to elucidate whether and how miR-6076 participates in the modulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2)-induced neuronal damage. To construct the neuronal damage model, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with A\u03b21-42 . By qRT-PCR, we found that miR-6076 is significantly upregulated in A\u03b21-42 -treated SH-SY5Y cells. After miR-6076 inhibition, p-Tau and apoptosis levels were downregulated, and cell viability was increased. Through online bioinformatics analysis, we found that B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) was a directly target of miR-6076 via dual-luciferase reporter assay. BCL6 overexpression mediated the decrease in elevated p-Tau levels and increased viability in SH-SY5Y cells following A\u03b21-42 treatment. Our results suggest that down-regulation of miR-6076 could attenuate A\u03b21-42 -induced neuronal damage by targeting BCL6, which provided a possible target to pursue for prevention and treatment of A\u03b2-induced neuronal damage in AD.",

Recent research has positioned the gut microbiota as an important susceptibility factor in Alzheimer's disease by showing specific alterations in the gut microbiome composition of Alzheimer's patients and in rodent models. However, it is unknown whether gut microbiota alterations are causal in the manifestation of Alzheimer's symptoms. To understand the involvement of Alzheimer's patient gut microbiota in host physiology and behaviour, we transplanted faecal microbiota from Alzheimer's patients and age-matched healthy controls into microbiota-depleted young adult rats. We found impairments in behaviours reliant on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, an essential process for certain memory functions and mood, resulting from Alzheimer's patient transplants. Notably, the severity of impairments correlated with clinical cognitive scores in donor patients. Discrete changes in the rat caecal and hippocampal metabolome were also evident. As hippocampal neurogenesis cannot be measured in living humans but is modulated by the circulatory systemic environment, we assessed the impact of the Alzheimer's systemic environment on proxy neurogenesis readouts. Serum from Alzheimer's patients decreased neurogenesis in human cells in vitro and were associated with cognitive scores and key microbial genera. Our findings reveal for the first time, that Alzheimer's symptoms can be transferred to a healthy young organism via the gut microbiota, confirming a causal role of gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease, and highlight hippocampal neurogenesis as a converging central cellular process regulating systemic circulatory and gut-mediated factors in Alzheimer's.",

However, the effect of the IFN-I response on pathological tau accumulation remains unclear. We examined the effects of IFN-I signaling in primary neural culture models of seeded tau aggregation and P301S-tau transgenic mouse models in the context of genetic deletion of the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR). Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C), a synthetic analog of viral nucleic acids, evoked a potent cytokine response that enhanced seeded aggregation of tau in an IFN-I-dependent manner. IFN-I-induced vulnerability could be pharmacologically prevented and was intrinsic to neurons. Aged P301S-tau mice lacking Ifnar1 had significantly reduced tau pathology compared to mice with intact IFN signaling. We identify a critical role for IFN-I in potentiating tau aggregation. IFN-I is therefore identified as a potential therapeutic target in AD and other tauopathies. Type-I IFN (IFN-I) promotes seeded tau aggregation in neural cultures. IFNAR inhibition prevents IFN-I driven sensitivity to tau aggregation. IFN-I driven vulnerability is intrinsic to neurons.

Novel approaches are desperately needed to help address this immense public health issue. Data suggests that early intervention at the first stages of mild cognitive impairment may have a greater chance for success. The calcineurin (CN)-Pin1 signaling cascade can be selectively targeted with tacrolimus (FK506), a highly specific, FDA-approved CN inhibitor used safely for\u2009>\u200920\u00a0years in solid organ transplant recipients. AD prevalence was significantly reduced in solid organ recipients treated with FK506. Time release pellets were used to deliver constant FK506 dosage to APP/PS1 mice without deleterious manipulation or handling. Immunofluorescence, histology, molecular biology, and behavior were used to evaluate changes in AD pathology. FK506 can be safely and consistently delivered into juvenile APP/PS1 mice via time-release pellets to levels roughly seen in transplant patients, leading to the normalization of CN activity and reduction or elimination of AD pathologies including synapse loss, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairment. Pin1 activity and function were rescued despite the continuing presence of high levels of transgenic A\u03b242. Indicators of neuroinflammation including Iba1 positivity and IL-6 production were also reduced to normal levels. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained during treatment or splenocytes isolated at euthanasia activated normally after mitogens. Low-dose, constant FK506 can normalize CNS CN and Pin1 activity, suppress neuroinflammation, and attenuate AD-associated pathology without blocking peripheral IL-2 responses making repurposed FK506 a viable option for early, therapeutic intervention in AD.",

While several markers of N have been proposed, efforts to define normal vs. abnormal neurodegeneration based on neuroimaging have been limited. Sensitive markers that may account for or predict cognitive dysfunction for individuals in early disease stages are critical. Participants (n\u2009=\u2009296) defined on A and T status and spanning the AD-clinical continuum underwent multi-shell diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to generate Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) metrics, which were tested as markers of N. To better define N, we developed age- and sex-adjusted robust z-score values to quantify normal and AD-associated (abnormal) neurodegeneration in both cortical gray matter and subcortical white matter regions of interest. We used general logistic regression with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) analysis to test whether NODDI metrics improved diagnostic accuracy compared to models that only relied on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A and T status (alone and in combination). Using internal robust norms, we found that NODDI metrics correlate with worsening cognitive status and that NODDI captures early, AD neurodegenerative pathology in the gray matter of cognitively unimpaired, but A/T biomarker-positive, individuals. NODDI metrics utilized together with A and T status improved diagnostic prediction accuracy of AD clinical status, compared with models using CSF A and T status alone. Using a robust norms approach, we show that abnormal AD-related neurodegeneration can be detected among cognitively unimpaired individuals. Metrics derived from diffusion-weighted imaging are potential sensitive markers of N and could be considered for trial enrichment and as outcomes in clinical trials.

Epistasis has been proposed as a major contributor to this 'missing heritability', however, many current methods are limited to only modelling additive effects. We use VariantSpark, a machine learning approach to GWAS, and BitEpi, a tool for epistasis detection, to identify AD associated variants and interactions across two independent cohorts, ADNI and UK Biobank. By incorporating significant epistatic interactions, we captured 10.41% more phenotypic variance than logistic regression (LR). We validate the well-established AD loci, APOE, and identify two novel genome-wide significant AD associated loci in both cohorts, SH3BP4 and SASH1, which are also in significant epistatic interactions with APOE. We show that the SH3BP4 SNP has a modulating effect on the known pathogenic APOE SNP, demonstrating a possible protective mechanism against AD. SASH1 is involved in a triplet interaction with pathogenic APOE SNP and ACOT11, where the SASH1 SNP lowered the pathogenic interaction effect between ACOT11 and APOE. Finally, we demonstrate that VariantSpark detects disease associations with 80% fewer controls than LR, unlocking discoveries in well annotated but smaller cohorts.",

NAD+ levels decline with aging and in some age-related diseases, and reduction in NAD+ affects all the hallmarks of aging. Here, we present an overview of the discovery of NAD+, the cellular pathways of producing and consuming NAD+, and discuss how imbalances in the production rate and cellular request of NAD+ likely contribute to aging and age-related diseases including neurodegeneration. Preclinical studies have revealed great potential for NAD+ precursors in promotion of healthy aging and improvement of neurodegeneration. This has led to the initiation of several clinical trials with NAD+ precursors to treat accelerated aging, age-associated dysfunctions, and diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. NAD supplementation has great future potential clinically, and these studies will also provide insight into the mechanisms of aging.",

        "AbstractText": "To develop an individualized method for detecting cognitive adverse events (CAEs) in the context of an ongoing trial of electroconvulsive therapy for refractory agitation and aggression for advanced dementia (ECT-AD study). Literature search aimed at identifying (a) cognitive measures appropriate for patients with advanced dementia, (b) functional scales to use as a proxy for cognitive status in patients with floor effects on baseline cognitive testing, and (c) statistical approaches for defining a CAE, to develop CAEs monitoring plan specifically for the ECT-AD study. Using the Severe Impairment Battery-8 (SIB-8), baseline floor effects are defined as a score of \u22645/16. For patients without floor effects, a decline of \u22656 points is considered a CAE. For patients with floor effects, a decline of \u226530 points from baseline on the Barthel Index is considered a CAE. These values were derived using the standard deviation index (SDI) approach to measuring reliable change. The proposed plan accounts for practical and statistical challenges in detecting CAEs in patients with advanced dementia. While this protocol was developed in the context of the ECT-AD study, the general approach can potentially be applied to other interventional neuropsychiatric studies that carry the risk of CAEs in patients with advanced dementia.",

Why did it take 30 years to achieve these successes? Developing potent therapies for reducing fibrillar amyloid was key, as was selection of patients at relatively early stages of disease. Biomarkers of the target pathologies, including amyloid and tau PET, and insights from past trials were also critical to the recent successes. Moving forward, the challenge will be to develop more efficacious therapies with greater efficiency. Novel trial designs, including combination therapies and umbrella and basket protocols, will accelerate clinical development. Better diversity and inclusivity of trial participants are needed, and blood-based biomarkers may help to improve access for medically underserved groups.

The purpose of our study is to explore the genetic linkage between AD and MS through bioinformatic analysis, providing new insights into the shared signatures and possible pathogenesis of two diseases. The common differential expressed genes (DEGs) were determined between AD and MS from datasets obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Further, functional and pathway enrichment analysis, PPI network construction, and identification of hub genes were carried out. The expression level of hub genes was validated in two other external AD and MS datasets. Transcription factor (TF)-gene interactions and gene-miRNA interactions were performed in NetworkAnalyst. Finally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was applied to evaluate the predictive value of hub genes. A total of 75 common DEGs were identified between AD and MS. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis emphasized the importance of exocytosis and synaptic vesicle cycle, respectively. Six significant hub genes, including CCL2, CD44, GFAP, NEFM, STXBP1, and TCEAL6 were identified and verified as common hub genes shared by AD and MS. FOXC1 and hsa-mir-16-5p are the most common TF and miRNA in regulating hub genes, respectively. In the ROC curve analysis, all hub genes showed good efficiency in helping distinguishing patients from controls. Our study firstly identified a common genetic signature between AD and MS, paving the road for investigating shared machanism of AD and MS.",

Patients with and without PTE were recruited and underwent an MRI post-TBI. Multimodal auto identification of ePVS algorithm was applied to T1-weighted MRIs to segment ePVS. The total number of ePVS was calculated and corrected for white matter volume, and an asymmetry index (AI) derived. PTE was diagnosed in 7 out of the 99 participants (male=69) after a median time of less than one year since injury (range 10-22). Brain lesions were observed in all 7 PTE+ cases (unilateral=4, 57%; bilateral=3, 43%) as compared to 40 PTE- cases (total 44%; unilateral=17, 42%; bilateral=23, 58%). There was a significant difference between PTE+ (M=1.21e-4, IQR [8.89e-5]) and PTE- cases (M=2.79e-4, IQR [6.25e-5]) in total corrected numbers of ePVS in patients with unilateral lesions (p=0.024). No differences in AI, trauma severity and lesion volume were seen between groups. This study has shown that automated quantification of ePVS is feasible and provided initial evidence that individuals with PTE with unilateral lesions may have fewer ePVS compared to TBI patients without epilepsy. Further studies with larger sample sizes should be conducted to determine the value of ePVS quantification as a PTE-biomarker.",

Ageing is considered to be the greatest risk factor for PD, with a complex interplay between genetics and the environment. With population ageing, the prevalence of PD is expected to escalate worldwide; thus, it is of utmost importance to reduce the burden of PD. To date, there are no therapies to cure the disease, and current treatment strategies focus on the management of symptoms. Older adults often have multiple chronic diseases and geriatric syndromes, which further complicates the management of PD. Healthcare systems and care models necessary to address the broad needs of older PD patients are largely unavailable. In this New Horizon article, we discuss various aspects of PD from an ageing perspective, including disease management.

        "AbstractText": "Numerous A\u03b2 proteoforms, identified in the human brain, possess differential neurotoxic and aggregation propensities. These proteoforms contribute in unknown ways to the conformations and resultant pathogenicity of oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils in Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifestation owing to the lack of molecular-level specificity to the exact chemical composition of underlying protein products with widespread interrogating techniques, like immunoassays. We evaluated A\u03b2 proteoform flux using quantitative top-down mass spectrometry (TDMS) in a well-studied 5xFAD mouse model of age-dependent A\u03b2-amyloidosis. Though the brain-derived A\u03b2 proteoform landscape is largely occupied by A\u03b21-42, 25 different forms of A\u03b2 with differential solubility were identified. These proteoforms fall into three natural groups defined by hierarchical clustering of expression levels in the context of mouse age and proteoform solubility, with each group sharing physiochemical properties associated with either N/C-terminal truncations or both. Overall, the TDMS workflow outlined may hold tremendous potential for investigating proteoform-level relationships between insoluble fibrils and soluble A\u03b2, including low-molecular-weight oligomers hypothesized to serve as the key drivers of neurotoxicity. Similarly, the workflow may also help to validate the utility of AD-relevant animal models to recapitulate amyloidosis mechanisms or possibly explain disconnects observed in therapeutic efficacy in animal models vs humans.",

        "AbstractText": "Multimodal imaging (MMI) has emerged as a powerful tool in clinical research, combining different imaging modes to acquire comprehensive information and enabling scientists and surgeons to study tissue identification, localization, metabolic activity, and molecular discovery, thus aiding in disease progression analysis. While multimodal instruments are gaining popularity, challenges such as non-standardized characteristics, custom software, inadequate commercial support, and integration issues with other instruments need to be addressed. The field of multimodal imaging or multiplexed imaging allows for simultaneous signal reproduction from multiple imaging strategies. Intraoperatively, MMI can be integrated into frameless stereotactic surgery. Recent developments in medical imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and Positron Emission Topography (PET) have brought new perspectives to multimodal imaging, enabling early cancer detection, molecular tracking, and real-time progression monitoring. Despite the evidence supporting the role of MMI in surgical decision-making, there is a need for comprehensive studies to validate and perform integration at the intersection of multiple imaging technologies. They were integrating mass spectrometry-based technologies (e.g., imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), imaging mass cytometry (IMC), and Ion mobility mass spectrometry ((IM-IM) with medical imaging modalities, offering promising avenues for molecular discovery and clinical applications. This review emphasizes the potential of multi-omics approaches in tissue mapping using MMI integrated into desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), allowing for sequential analyses of the same section. By addressing existing knowledge gaps, this review encourages future research endeavors toward multi-omics approaches, providing a roadmap for future research and enhancing the value of MMI in molecular pathology for diagnosis.",

        "AbstractText": "According to the amyloid hypothesis, in the early phases of Alzheimer's disease (AD), small soluble prefibrillar aggregates of the amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2) interact with neuronal membranes, causing neural impairment. Such highly reactive and toxic species form spontaneously and transiently in the amyloid building pathway. A therapeutic strategy consists of the recruitment of these intermediates, thus preventing aberrant interaction with membrane components (lipids and receptors), which in turn may trigger a cascade of cellular disequilibria. Milk \u03b1s1-Casein is an intrinsically disordered protein that is able to inhibit A\u03b2 amyloid aggregation in vitro, by sequestering transient species. In order to test \u03b1s1-Casein as an inhibitor for the treatment of AD, it needs to be delivered in the place of action. Here, we demonstrate the use of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) as suitable nanocarriers for \u03b1s1-Casein. Proteo-LUVs were prepared and characterized by different biophysical techniques, such as multiangle light scattering, atomic force imaging, and small-angle X-ray scattering; \u03b1s1-Casein loading was quantified by a fluorescence assay. We demonstrated on a C. elegans AD model the effectiveness of the proposed delivery strategy in vivo. Proteo-LUVs allow efficient administration of the protein, exerting a positive functional readout at very low doses while avoiding the intrinsic toxicity of \u03b1s1-Casein. Proteo-LUVs of \u03b1s1-Casein represent an effective proof of concept for the exploitation of partially disordered proteins as a therapeutic strategy in mild AD conditions.",

For example, antidepressant use was persistently higher among patients with dementia compared with controls, and the difference increased from 2 years before dementia diagnosis (15.9% vs 7.9%, P\u2009<\u2009.001), peaked approximately 6 months after dementia diagnosis (29.1% vs 9.7%, P\u2009<\u2009.001), and then decreased slowly from 3 years after diagnosis but remained higher than controls 5 years after diagnosis (16.4% vs 6.9%, P\u2009<\u2009.001). The findings of this cohort study that patients with dementia had markedly increased risks of psychiatric disorders both before and after dementia diagnosis highlight the significance of incorporating psychiatric preventative and management interventions for individuals with dementia across various diagnostic stages.",

        "AbstractText": "Evidence that adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with an increased risk of dementia is scarce and inconsistent, and potential sources of bias are untested. To examine the association between adult ADHD and the risk of dementia. This prospective national cohort study consisted of 109\u202f218 members of a nonprofit Israeli health maintenance organization born between 1933 and 1952 who entered the cohort on January 1, 2003, without an ADHD or dementia diagnosis and were followed up to February 28, 2020. Participants were aged 51 to 70 years in 2003. Statistical analysis was conducted from December 2022 to August 2023. Adult ADHD was a time-varying covariate, classified as present from the age of the first diagnosis (using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision); otherwise, absent. Cox regression models were fitted to quantify the association between adult ADHD and the risk of incident dementia with hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% CIs unadjusted and in the primary analysis, using inverse probability weights, adjusted for 18 sources of potential confounding. In 14 complementary analyses, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were implemented. At the beginning of the follow-up, the sample of 109\u202f218 participants had a mean (SD) age of 57.7 (5.5) years, 56\u202f474 participants (51.7%) were female, and 52\u202f744 (48.3%) were male. During follow-up, 730 participants (0.7%) received a diagnosis of adult ADHD, and 7726 (7.1%) received a diagnosis of dementia. Dementia occurred among 96 of 730 participants (13.2%) with adult ADHD and 7630 of 108\u202f488 participants (7.0%) without adult ADHD. In the primary analysis, compared with the absence of adult ADHD, the presence of adult ADHD was statistically significantly (P\u2009<\u2009.001) associated with an increased dementia risk (unadjusted HR, 3.62 [95% CI, 2.92-4.49; P\u2009<\u2009.001]; adjusted HR, 2.77 [95% CI, 2.11-3.63; P\u2009<\u2009.001]). Twelve of the 14 complementary analyses did not attenuate the conclusions based on the results of the primary analysis. There was, however, no clear increase in the risk of dementia associated with adult ADHD among those who received psychostimulant medication, and evidence of reverse causation was mild. In this cohort study of individuals born between 1933 and 1952 and followed up in old age, adult ADHD was associated with an increased risk of dementia. Policy makers, caregivers, patients, and clinicians may wish to monitor reliably for ADHD in old age.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease contributes to 60-70% of all dementia cases in the general population. Belonging to the BIN1/amphiphysin/RVS167 (BAR) superfamily, the bridging integrator (BIN1) has been identified to impact two major pathological hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease (AD), i.e., amyloid beta (A\u03b2) and tau accumulation. A\u03b2 accumulation is found to increase by BIN1 knockdown in cortical neurons in late-onset AD, due to BACE1 accumulation at enlarged early endosomes. Two BIN1 mutants, KR and PL, were identified to exhibit A\u03b2 accumulation. Furthermore, BIN1 deficiency by BIN1-related polymorphisms impairs the interaction with tau, thus elevating tau phosphorylation, altering synapse structure and tau function. Even though the precise role of BIN1 in the neuronal tissue needs further investigation, the authors aim to throw light on the potential of BIN1 and unfold its implications on tau and A\u03b2 pathology, to aid AD researchers across the globe to examine BIN1, as an appropriate target gene for disease management.",

        "AbstractText": "Oligomeric aggregates of the amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptide have been implicated as the toxic species for Alzheimer's disease by contributing to oxidative cytotoxicity and physical disruption in cell membranes in the brain. Recent evidence points to the ability of the catecholamine neurotransmitter dopamine in the presence of copper ions to both stabilize oligomers and decrease the toxic effects of these oligomers. Based on these results, physical characterization of aggregates and subsequent cell studies with a neuroblastoma line were performed that show both dopamine and the related neurotransmitter, norepinephrine, can stabilize oligomers and decrease toxicity of A\u03b2 aggregates without copper present. To investigate this reduction of toxicity, structural characterization of oligomers in the presence of neurotransmitters was compared to aggregates formed with A\u03b2 alone. Gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy show higher levels of oligomers in the presence of dopamine and norepinephrine, yet the oligomer structure is largely amorphous. A\u03b2 aggregated alone forms the predicted highly organized fibrillar species, with increased levels of dityrosine covalent linkages, which are largely absent in the presence of the neurotransmitters. A proposed mechanism for the observed decrease in cell death by A\u03b2 in the presence of dopamine and norepinephrine suggests the neurotransmitters both block the formation of organized oligomer structures and dityrosine stabilizing linkages while also behaving as antioxidants, providing a dual mechanism for increased cell viability.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Neprilysin inhibitors and risk of Alzheimer's disease: A future perspective.",
        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease with multifaceted neuropathological disorders. AD is characterized by intracellular accumulation of phosphorylated tau proteins and extracellular deposition of amyloid beta (A\u03b2). Various protease enzymes, including neprilysin (NEP), are concerned with the degradation and clearance of A\u03b2. Indeed, a defective neuronal clearance pathway due to the dysfunction of degradation enzymes might be a possible mechanism for the accumulation of A\u03b2 and subsequent progression of AD neuropathology. NEP is one of the most imperative metalloproteinase enzymes involved in the clearance of A\u03b2. This review aimed to highlight the possible role of NEP inhibitors in AD. The combination of sacubitril and valsartan which is called angiotensin receptor blocker and NEP inhibitor (ARNI) may produce beneficial and deleterious effects on AD neuropathology. NEP inhibitors might increase the risk of AD by the inhibition of A\u03b2 clearance, and increase brain bradykinin (BK) and natriuretic peptides (NPs), which augment the pathogenesis of AD. These verdicts come from animal model studies, though they may not be applied to humans. However, clinical studies revealed promising safety findings regarding the use of ARNI. Moreover, NEP inhibition increases various neuroprotective peptides involved in inflammation, glucose homeostasis and nerve conduction. Also, NEP inhibitors may inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) expression, ameliorating insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels. These findings proposed that NEP inhibitors may have a protective effect against AD development by increasing GLP-1, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and substance P, and deleterious effects by increasing brain BK. Preclinical and clinical studies are recommended in this regard.",

Patients with subjective memory impairment (SMI), amnestic and non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment ((n)aMCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), mixed and vascular dementia (MD/VD) from our memory clinic were included in this retrospective analysis. Patients underwent neuropsychological testing and cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Magnetic resonance imaging data sets were analyzed regarding the presence of CAA-related MRI biomarkers to determine CAA prevalence. ANOVAs were used to investigate the contribution of CAA to cognitive impairment within diagnostic groups and to determine whether differences in cognitive test performance between the diagnostic groups are mediated by total CAA burden. 475 patients (222 male, 253 female) with SMI (n\u00a0=\u00a047), naMCI (n\u00a0=\u00a041), aMCI (n\u00a0=\u00a0189), early AD (n\u00a0=\u00a09), AD (n\u00a0=\u00a0114), MD (n\u00a0=\u00a071) and VD (n\u00a0=\u00a04) were included. Mean age was 73.2 (9.9) years. CAA prevalence was 14.9% in SMI, 14.6% in naMCI, 24.3% in aMCI, 22.2% in early onset AD, 18.4% in late onset AD, 46.5% in MD and 25% in VD. Patients with possible and probable CAA were older than patients without CAA. In particular, diagnosis of aMCI, early onset AD, MD and VD showed high CAA prevalence. In AD but not in aMCI, CAA diagnosis significantly influenced test performance in the CERAD word list recall (F (1,78)\u00a0=\u00a04505; p\u00a0=\u00a00.037; partial eta-square\u00a0=\u00a00.055). Differences in cognitive test performance between the diagnostic groups of naMCI, aMCI, AD and MD were mediated by total CAA burden within AAT simply nouns subtest (F (2,39)\u00a0=\u00a04059; p\u00a0=\u00a00.025; partial eta-square\u00a0=\u00a00.172) and in CERAD verbal fluency test (F (3,129)\u00a0=\u00a03533; p\u00a0=\u00a00.017; partial eta-square\u00a0=\u00a00.076). This retrospective analysis demonstrates high prevalence rates of CAA in cognitive diagnoses. Our data suggest that comorbid CAA independently impacts cognitive test performance in the course of AD with presumably stage-dependent effects. Especially in patients with AD comorbid CAA additionally impairs memory function. Total CAA small vessel disease burden further modulates psychometric differences in cognitive test performance between diagnostic groups regarding word finding and word fluency capabilities.",

Whether biological sex causally modulates the relationship between cholinergic signaling and amyloid pathology remains unknown. We quantified amyloid beta (A\u03b2) in male and female App-mutant mice with either decreased or increased cholinergic tone and examined the impact of ovariectomy and estradiol replacement in this relationship. We also investigated longitudinal changes in basal forebrain (cholinergic function) and A\u03b2 in elderly individuals. We show a causal relationship between cholinergic tone and amyloid pathology in males and ovariectomized female mice, which is decoupled in ovary-intact and ovariectomized females receiving estradiol. In elderly humans, cholinergic loss exacerbates A\u03b2. Our findings emphasize the importance of reflecting human menopause in mouse models. They also support a role for therapies targeting estradiol and cholinergic signaling to reduce A\u03b2. Cholinergic tone regulates amyloid beta (A\u03b2) pathology in males and ovariectomized female mice. Estradiol uncouples the relationship between cholinergic tone and A\u03b2.

Convergent evidence suggests structural connectome abnormalities in specific brain regions are linked to AD progression. The biological basis underpinnings of these connectome changes, however, have remained elusive. We utilized an individual regional mean connectivity strength (RMCS) derived from a regional radiomics similarity network to capture altered morphological connectivity in 1654 participants (605 normal controls, 766 mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 283 AD). Then, we also explored the biological basis behind these morphological changes through gene enrichment analysis and cell-specific analysis. We found that RMCS probes of the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe were significantly altered in AD and MCI, with these differences being spatially related to the expression of AD-risk genes. In addition, gene enrichment analysis revealed that the modulation of chemical synaptic transmission is the most relevant biological process associated with the altered RMCS in AD. Notably, neuronal cells were found to be the most pertinent cells in the altered RMCS. Our findings shed light on understanding the biological basis of structural connectome changes in AD, which may ultimately lead to more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this devastating disease.",

Outcome was cognitive function measured by neuropsychological tests and strict protocols. Exclusion criteria included non-Alzheimer's dementia, progesterone-only therapy and pre-menopausal women. Searches were conducted in nine electronic healthcare databases, last searched in July 2022. Quality assessments conducted on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were performed with the GRADE assessment, and cohort studies and case-control studies were assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Extracted data were used to analyse participants, interventions and outcomes. Twenty-four studies satisfied the search criteria (four RCTs, nine cohort studies, 11 case-control studies). Fifteen studies showed positive associations for oestrogen-only therapy reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease, and the remaining nine found no evidence of association. Fifteen studies showed that oestrogen-only therapy effectively reduced the risk of Alzheimer's disease, whereas nine showed no correlation. Studies also investigated oestrogen-related variables such as length of oestrogen exposure, being an apolipoprotein E \u03b54 carrier and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and their role in neuroprotection. This review was limited by the limited ranges of duration of oestrogen treatment and type of oestrogen-only therapy used.

The aim of this study was to evaluate primary healthcare providers' knowledge of dementia and cognitive assessment tools in Southeast Nigeria in preparation for the introduction of digital tablet-based assessment tool. This is a cross-sectional mixed method descriptive pilot survey carried out in a comprehensive healthcare center affiliated with Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital. Fifty healthcare workers participated. Convenience sampling was employed involving all consenting primary healthcare providers in comprehensive healthcare center-Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital.

Primary healthcare providers reported that dementia is associated with memory loss and can be genetically inherited. None of the respondents were familiar with Montreal cognitive assessment, or any form of tablet-based cognitive assessment tool. Most (86%) knew about the mini mental state examination. Primary healthcare providers are deficient in knowledge of dementia Alzheimer's or cognitive assessment tools, and so they do not routinely carryout cognitive screening in elderly patients during clinic visits.

HIF-1 is also associated in the pathogenesis of many brain diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), epilepsy and stroke. HIF-1 regulates the expression of many genes such as those involved in glycolysis, erythropoiesis, angiogenesis and proliferation in hypoxic condition. Despite several studies, the mechanism through which HIF-1 confers neuroprotection remains unclear, one of them is modulating metabolic profiles and inflammatory pathways. Characterization of the neuroprotective role of HIF-1 may be through its stabilization and the regulation of target genes that aid in the early adaptation to the oxidative stressors. It is interesting to note that mounting data from recent years point to an additional crucial regulatory role for hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) in inflammation. HIFs in immune cells regulate the production of glycolytic energy as well as innate immunity, pro-inflammatory gene expression, and mediates activation of pro-survival pathways. The present review highlights the contribution of HIF-1 to neuroprotection where inflammation is the crucial factor in the pathogenesis contributing to neural death. The potential mechanisms that contribute to neuroprotection as a result of the downstream targets of HIF-1\u03b1 are discussed.

The liberated CP2cs also inhibit TDP2, causing intrinsic genome-wide DNA strand breaks and subsequent catastrophic DNA damage responses. These two mechanisms are independent of cancer driver mutations but are hindered by high MDM2 p60 expression. However, resistance to ACP52C mediated by MDM2 p60 can be sensitized by CASP2 inhibition. Additionally, derivatives of ACP52C conjugated with fatty acid alone or with a CASP2 inhibiting peptide show improved pharmacokinetics and reduced cancer burden, even in ACP52C-resistant cancers. This study enhances the understanding of ACP52C-induced cancer-specific apoptosis induction and supports the use of ACP52C in anticancer drug development.",

        "AbstractText": "Fluoroethylnormemantine (FENM) is a Memantine derivative with anti-amnesic and neuroprotective activities showed in the A\u03b225-35 pharmacological mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As AD is a complex multi-factorial neurodegenerative pathology, combination therapies relying on drugs acting through different pathways, have been suggested to more adequately address neuroprotection. As several agonists of the sigma-1 receptor (S1R), an intracellular chaperone, are presently in phase 2 or 3 clinical trials in neurodegenetrative diseases including AD, we examined the potentialities of S1R drug-based combinations with FENM, or Memantine. A\u03b225-35-treated mice were treated with S1R agonists (PRE-084, Igmesine, Cutamesine) and/or FENM, or Memantine, during 7 days after intracerebroventricular administration of oligomerized A\u03b225-35. Mice were then tested for spatial short-term memory on day 8 and non-spatial long-term memory on days 9-10, using the spontaneous alternation or passive avoidance tests, respectively. The FENM or Memantine combination with Donepezil, that non-selectively inhibits acetylcholinesterase and activates S1R, was also tested. The efficacy of combinations using maximal non-active or minimal active doses of S1R agonist or FENM was analyzed using calculations of the combination index, based on simple isobologram representation. Data showed that most of the FENM-based combinations led to synergistic protection against A\u03b225-35-induced learning deficits, for both long- and short-term memory responses, with a higher efficiency on the latter. Memantine led to synergistic combination in short-term memory but poorly in long-term memory responses, with either PRE-084 or Donepezil. These study showed that drug combinations based on FENM and S1R agonists may lead to highly effective and synergistic protection in AD, particularly on short-term memory.",

        "AbstractText": "The advent of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for Parkinson's disease 30 years ago has ushered a global breakthrough of DBS as a universal method for therapy and research in wide areas of neurology and psychiatry. The literature of the last three decades has described numerous concepts and practices of DBS, often branded as novelties or discoveries. However, reading the contemporary publications often elicits a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in relation to several methods, attributes, and practices of DBS. Here, we review various applications and techniques of the modern-era DBS and compare them with practices of the past. Compared with modern literature, publications of the old-era functional stereotactic neurosurgery, including old-era DBS, show that from the very beginning multidisciplinarity and teamwork were often prevalent and insisted upon, ethical concerns were recognized, brain circuitries and rational for brain targets were discussed, surgical indications were similar, closed-loop stimulation was attempted, evaluations of surgical results were debated, and controversies were common. Thus, it appears that virtually everything done today in the field of DBS bears resemblance to old-time practices, or has been done before, albeit with partly other tools and techniques. Movement disorders remain the main indications for modern DBS as was the case for lesional surgery and old-era DBS. The novelties today consist of the STN as the dominant target for DBS, the tremendous advances in computerized brain imaging, the sophistication and versatility of implantable DBS hardware, and the large potential for research. Many aspects of contemporary DBS bear strong resemblance to practices of the past. The dominant clinical indications remain movement disorders with virtually the same brain targets as in the past, with one exception: the STN. Other novel brain targets - that are so far subject to DBS trials - are the pedunculopontine nucleus for gait freezing, the anteromedial internal pallidum for Gilles de la Tourette and the fornix for Alzheimer's disease. The major innovations and novelties compared to the past concern mainly the unmatched level of research activity, its high degree of sponsorship, and the outstanding advances in technology that have enabled multimodal brain imaging and the miniaturization, versatility, and sophistication of implantable hardware. The greatest benefit for patients today, compared to the past, is the higher level of precision and safety of DBS, and of all functional stereotactic neurosurgery.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) threatens elderly human health and still lacks effective treatment. Our previous work showed that LGZGD possessed a neuroprotective effect on the A\u03b225-35-induced neurotoxicity in differentiated PC12 cells, indicating that LGZGD may be a potential drug for treatment of AD. However, its pharmacodynamic substances which show anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant stress activities are still unrevealed. This research aims to reveal the pharmacodynamic substances of LGZGD on A\u03b225-35-induced PC12 cell model of AD based on a spectrum-effect relationship study by using HPLC-FT-ICR-MS method and multivariate statistical analysis. Firstly, the chemical composition spectra of different combinations of LGZGD were recorded by HPLC-FT-ICR MS. Subsequently, A\u03b225-35-induced PC12 cell model of AD was established and pharmacodynamic experiments were conducted to evaluate their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities, respectively. Finally, the potential pharmacodynamic substances were screened out through spectrum-effect relationship study accompanied by multivariate statistical analysis including bivariate correlation analysis (BCA), grey relational analysis (GRA), principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares regression analysis (PLSR). As a result, a total of 96 chemical consistents in different combinations of LGZGD were discovered. Among them, 7 components such as isoglabrolide, licorice saponin E2, licorice saponin N2 and licoisoflavanone were directly linked with the anti-inflammatory effects, and 14 constituents such as tumulosic acid, polyporenic acid C, dehydrotumulosic acid, dehydropachymic acid, and pachymic acid were directly correlated with the anti-oxidative stress activities. In conclusion, we combined the HPLC-FT-ICR-MS spectra with pharmacodynamic indicators to develop the spectrum-effect relationships of LGZGD for the first time, and successfully revealed its potential pharmacodynamic substances in the treatment of AD from the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pathways in the cell model.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative condition, is defined by neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, and gradual cognitive decline. Regardless of the advances in understanding AD's pathogenesis and progression, its causes are still contested, and there are currently no efficient therapies for the illness. The post-mortem analyses revealed widespread neuronal loss in multiple brain regions in AD, evidenced by a decrease in neuronal density and correlated with the disease's progression and cognitive deterioration. AD's neurodegeneration is complicated, and different types of neuronal cell death, alone or in combination, play crucial roles in this process. Recently, the involvement of non-apoptotic programmed cell death in the neurodegenerative mechanisms of AD has received a lot of attention. Aberrant activation of necroptosis and ferroptosis, two newly discovered forms of regulated non-apoptotic cell death, is thought to contribute to neuronal cell death in AD. In this review, we first address the main features of necroptosis and ferroptosis, cellular signaling cascades, and the mechanisms involved in AD pathology. Then, we discuss the latest therapies targeting necroptosis and ferroptosis in AD animal/cell models and human research to provide vital information for AD treatment.",

Disease-associated conformations of filamentous tau are characterized by hydrophobic interactions between side chains on unique and distant \u03b2-strand modules within each protomer.

Termed \"\u03b2-bracelets\", these proteomimetics assemble in a sequence- and macrocycle-dependent fashion, resulting in amyloid-like fibrils that feature in-register parallel \u03b2-sheet structure. Backbone N-amination of a selected \u03b2-bracelet affords soluble inhibitors of tau aggregation. We further demonstrate that the N-aminated macrocycles block the prion-like cellular seeding activity of recombinant tau as well as mature fibrils from AD patient extracts.

For treatment of AD, many researchers have attempted to find medicinal resources with high effectiveness and without side effects. Oligonol is a low molecular weight polypeptide derived from lychee fruit extract. We investigated the effects of oligonol in 5 \u00d7 FAD transgenic AD mice, which developed severe amyloid pathology, through behavioral tests (Barnes maze, marble burying, and nestle shredding) and molecular experiments. Oligonol treatment attenuated blood glucose levels and increased the antioxidant response in the livers of 5 \u00d7 FAD mice. Moreover, the behavioral score data showed improvements in anxiety, depressive behavior, and cognitive impairment following a 2-month course of orally administered oligonol. Oligonol treatment not only altered the circulating levels of cytokines and adipokines in 5 \u00d7 FAD mice, but also significantly enhanced the mRNA and protein levels of antioxidant enzymes and synaptic plasticity in the brain cortex and hippocampus. Therefore, we highlight the therapeutic potential of oligonol to attenuate neuropsychiatric problems and improve memory deficits in the early stage of AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Nomenclature in the field of neurodegenerative diseases presents a challenging problem. Inconsistent use of terms such as Alzheimer disease and dementia has compromised progress in clinical care, research, and development of therapeutics. Dementia-associated stigma further contributes to inconsistent and imprecise language. The result is a lack of clarity that produces confusion with patients and the general public and presents communication challenges among researchers. Therefore, the Advisory Council on Research, Care, and Services of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease authorized a committee to make recommendations for improvement. To establish a systematic neurodegenerative disease framework for information collection and communication to standardize language usage for research, clinical, and public health purposes. The Dementia Nomenclature Initiative organized into 3 major stakeholder working groups: clinicians, researchers, and the public (including individuals living with dementia and family caregivers). To inform the work, the initiative completed a narrative literature review of dementia nomenclature evolution over the last century across the PubMed, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Scopus databases (January 1, 2000, through July 31, 2020). Initiative working groups used the results as a foundation for understanding current challenges with dementia nomenclature and implications for research, clinical practice, and public understanding. The initiative obtained additional input via focus groups with individuals living with dementia and caregivers, with separate groups for race and ethnicity (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, and White) as an initial assessment of the meaning of dementia-related terms to these groups. From working group deliberations, the literature review, and focus group input, the initiative developed a framework clearly separating the clinical syndromic presentation experienced by affected individuals from possible underlying pathophysiologies. In the framework, domains of clinical impairment, such as cognitive, behavioral, motor, and other neurologic features, are graded by level of impairment between none and severe. Next, biomarker information describes underlying disease processes, explains the syndrome, and identifies possible disease labels: Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies, or vascular cognitive impairment dementia. The Dementia Nomenclature Initiative established a framework to guide communication about cognitive impairment among older adults. Wider testing and refinement of the framework will subsequently improve the information used in communicating about cognitive impairment and the way in which the information is used in clinical, research, and public settings.",

To determine the incremental changes associated with dementia in regard to older adults' care use and assess financial consequences for individuals, families, and society. This population-based cohort study included propensity score matching on national, longitudinal data using extensive baseline variables of sociodemographic characteristics, economic status, family availability, health conditions, disability status, and outpatient care use among 2 groups of US adults aged 55 years or older who did not have dementia. In total, 2387 adults experienced the onset of dementia during the 2-year follow-up (dementia group) and 2387 adults did not (control group). Participants were followed up for 8 years from the baseline. Data were analyzed from February 2021 to August 2023. Dementia determined based on Langa-Weir classification. Outcomes of care use included monthly care hours from family and unpaid helpers, in-home medical services, hospital stay, and nursing facility stay. Financial outcomes included out-of-pocket medical costs, wealth, and the status of having Medicaid. Among the full sample, the mean (SD) age was 75.4 [10.4] years, and 59.7% of participants were female. Care use was similar at baseline between the matched groups but was substantially greater for the dementia group vs control group in subsequent years, especially during the 2-year follow-up: 45 vs 13 monthly care hours from family and unpaid helpers, 548 of 2370 participants (23.1%) vs 342 of 2383 (14.4%) using in-home medical care, 1104 of 2369 (46.6%) vs 821 of 2377 (34.5%) with hospital stay, and 489 of 2375 (20.6%) vs 104 of 2384 (4.4%) using a nursing facility. The increase in use of a nursing facility was especially high if baseline family care availability was low. Over the 8-year follow-up in the dementia group, the 2-year out-of-pocket medical costs increased from $4005 to $10\u202f006, median wealth was reduced from $79\u202f339 to $30\u202f490, and those enrolling in Medicaid increased from 379 of 2358 participants (16.1%) to 201 of 676 participants (29.7%). No statistically significant changes in financial outcomes were found in the control group. This cohort study demonstrated that the incremental changes associated with dementia in regard to older adults' long-term care and financial burden are substantial.

To estimate the associations of neurodegeneration and parenchymal and vessel amyloidosis with WMH accumulation and investigate whether systemic vascular risk is associated with WMH beyond these AD-intrinsic processes. This cohort study used data from 3 longitudinal cohort studies conducted in tertiary and community-based medical centers-the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN; February 2010 to March 2020), the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; July 2007 to September 2021), and the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS; September 2010 to December 2019). The main outcomes were the independent associations of neurodegeneration (decreases in gray matter volume), parenchymal amyloidosis (assessed by amyloid positron emission tomography), and vessel amyloidosis (evidenced by cerebral microbleeds [CMBs]) with cross-sectional and longitudinal WMH. Data from 3960 MRI sessions among 1141 participants were included: 252 pathogenic variant carriers from DIAN (mean [SD] age, 38.4 [11.2] years; 137 [54%] female), 571 older adults from ADNI (mean [SD] age, 72.8 [7.3] years; 274 [48%] female), and 318 older adults from HABS (mean [SD] age, 72.4 [7.6] years; 194 [61%] female). Longitudinal increases in WMH volume were greater in individuals with CMBs compared with those without (DIAN: t\u2009=\u20093.2 [P\u2009=\u2009.001]; ADNI: t\u2009=\u20092.7 [P\u2009=\u2009.008]), associated with longitudinal decreases in gray matter volume (DIAN: t\u2009=\u2009-3.1 [P\u2009=\u2009.002]; ADNI: t\u2009=\u2009-5.6 [P\u2009<\u2009.001]; HABS: t\u2009=\u2009-2.2 [P\u2009=\u2009.03]), greater in older individuals (DIAN: t\u2009=\u20096.8 [P\u2009<\u2009.001]; ADNI: t\u2009=\u20099.1 [P\u2009<\u2009.001]; HABS: t\u2009=\u20095.4 [P\u2009<\u2009.001]), and not associated with systemic vascular risk (DIAN: t\u2009=\u20090.7 [P\u2009=\u2009.40]; ADNI: t\u2009=\u20090.6 [P\u2009=\u2009.50]; HABS: t\u2009=\u20091.8 [P\u2009=\u2009.06]) in individuals with ADAD and LOAD after accounting for age, gray matter volume, CMB presence, and amyloid burden. In older adults without CMBs at baseline, greater WMH volume was associated with CMB development during longitudinal follow-up (Cox proportional hazards regression model hazard ratio, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.72-4.03; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The findings suggest that increased WMH volume in AD is associated with neurodegeneration and parenchymal and vessel amyloidosis but not with elevated systemic vascular risk. Additionally, increased WMH volume may represent an early sign of vessel amyloidosis preceding the emergence of CMBs.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder causing memory loss and cognitive decline, linked to amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau protein accumulation in the brain. Environmental pollutant bisphenol A (BPA) has been implicated in AD pathology due to its neurotoxic effects. This study aims to evaluate cyanidin from flower bracts of Musa acuminata Colla (red variety; AAA group) for its neuroprotective properties against BPA-induced AD pathology. The extraction of cyanidin was optimized using 70% ethanol in acidified water, showing promising anti-acetylcholinesterase activity. Cyanidin was effectively purified from the resultant extract and characterized using spectroscopic techniques. Two gradient doses of cyanidin (90 and 10\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) were determined based on cell viability assay. The role of cyanidin in promoting nerve growth and differentiation was assessed in PC12 cells for up to 72\u00a0h. A discernible and statistically significant difference was assessed in neurite extension at both doses at 72\u00a0h, followed by pre-treatment with cyanidin. BPA stimulation significantly increased the p-tau expression compared to the control (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Pre-treatment with cyanidin reduced the tau expression; however, a significant difference was observed compared to control cells (p\u2009=\u20090.0003). Cyanidin significantly enhanced the mRNA expression of Wnt3a (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), \u03b2-catenin (p\u2009=\u20090.0004), and NeuroD1 (p\u2009=\u20090.0289), and decreased the expression of WIF1(p\u2009=\u20090.0040) and DKK1 (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), which are Wnt antagonist when compared to cells stimulated with BPA. Conclusively, our finding suggests that cyanidin could agonize nerve growth factor and promote neuronal differentiation, reduce tau-hyperphosphorylation by restoring the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling cascade, and thereby render its neuroprotective potential against BPA-induced AD pathology.",

Although the expression of orexin system genes under physiological condition has circadian rhythm, the diurnal characteristics of orexin system genes, and its potential role in the pathogenesis in AD are unknown. In the present study, we hope to elucidate the diurnal characteristics of orexin system genes at the early stage of AD, and to investigate its potential role in the development of AD neuropathology. We firstly detected the mRNA levels of orexin system genes, AD risk genes and core clock genes (CCGs) in hypothalamus and hippocampus in 6-month-old male 3xTg-AD mice and C57BL/6J (wild type, WT) control mice, then analyzed diurnal expression profiles of all genes using JTK_CYCLE algorithm, and did the correlation analysis between expression of orexin system genes and AD risk genes or CCGs. In addition, the expression of \u03b2-amyloid protein (A\u03b2) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein were measured. The results showed that the diurnal mRNA expression profiles of PPO, OX1R, OX2R, Bace2, Bmal1, Per1, Per2 and Cry1 in the hypothalamus, and gene expression of OX1R, OX2R, Bace1, Bmal1, Per1 and Cry2 in the hippocampus in 3xTg-AD mice were different from that in WT mice. Furthermore, there is positive correlation between orexin system genes and AD risk genes or CCGs in the brain in 3xTg-AD mice. In addition, the expression of A\u03b2 and p-tau in hippocampus in 3xTg-AD mice were significantly increased, and the expression of p-tau is higher in night than in day. These results indicate that the abnormal expression profiles of orexin system genes and its interaction with AD risk genes or CCGs might exert important role in the pathogenesis of AD, which will increase the expression of A\u03b2 and p-tau, and accelerate the development of AD.",

To achieve this, we employed UIO-66-NH2 as a carrier container to load MB (Methylene Blue), and Fe3O4 MNPs (iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles) with aptamer (ssDNA-Fe3O4 MNPs) fixed on their surface for biological gating. The ssDNA-Fe3O4 MNPs were immobilized onto the surface of UIO-66-NH2 through hydrogen bonding between the aptamer and the -NH2 group on the surface of UIO-66-NH2, thereby encapsulating MB and forming ssDNA-Fe3O4@MB@UIO-66-NH2. During the detection of A\u03b2O, the aptamer selectively reacted with A\u03b2O to form the A\u03b2O-ssDNA-Fe3O4 complex, leading to its detachment from the surface of UIO-66-NH2. This detachment facilitated the release of MB, enabling its electrochemical detection. Simultaneously, the A\u03b2O-ssDNA-Fe3O4 complex was efficiently collected and separated using a magnet after leaving the container's surface. Furthermore, the addition of NaOH facilitated the disconnection of biotin modifications at the 3' end of the aptamer from the avidin modifications on the Fe3O4 MNPs. Consequently, the aptamer detached from the surface of Fe3O4 MNPs, resulting in the restoration of fluorescence intensity of FAM (fluorescein-5'-carboxamidite) modified at its 5' end for fluorescence detection. The dual-mode sensor exhibited significantly enhanced differential pulse voltammetry signals and fluorescence intensity compared to those in the absence of A\u03b2O. The sensor demonstrated a wide detection range of 10 fM to 10 \u03bcM, with a detection limit of 3.4 fM.

The early diagnosis of AD is an important factor for the control of AD progression. Electroencephalography (EEG) can be used for early diagnosis of AD. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are also used for the amelioration of AD symptoms. In this systematic review, we reviewed the effect of different AChEIs including donepezil, rivastigmine, tacrine, physostigmine, and galantamine on EEG patterns in patients with AD. PubMed electronic database was searched and 122 articles were found. After removal of unrelated articles, 24 articles were selected for the present study. AChEIs can decrease beta, theta, and delta frequency bands in patients with AD. However, conflicting results were found for alpha band. Some studies have shown increased alpha frequency, while others have shown decreased alpha frequency following treatment with AChEIs. The only difference was the type of drug. We found that studies reporting the decreased alpha frequency used donepezil and galantamine, while studies reporting the increased alpha frequency used rivastigmine and tacrine. It was suggested that future studies should focus on the effect of different AChEIs on EEG bands, especially alpha frequency in patients with AD, to compare their effects and find the reason for their different influence on EEG patterns. Also, differences between the effects of AChEIs on oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination may be another important factor.

Here we used untargeted chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry-based adductomics (LC-MS/MS) to begin to define the landscape of DNA modifications in rat and human tissues. A basis set of 114 putative DNA adducts was identified in heart, liver, brain, and kidney in 1-26-month-old rats and 111 in human heart and brain by 'stepped MRM' LC-MS/MS. Subsequent targeted analysis of these species revealed species-, tissue-, age-\u00a0and sex-biases. Structural characterization of 10 selected adductomic signals as known DNA modifications validated the method and established confidence in the DNA origins of the signals. Along with strong tissue biases, we observed significant age-dependence for 36 adducts, including N2-CMdG, 5-HMdC\u00a0and 8-Oxo-dG in rats and 1,N6-\u03f5dA in human heart, as well as sex biases for 67 adducts in rat tissues.

Our dataset of 114 putative adducts serves as a resource for characterizing dozens of new forms of DNA damage, defining mechanisms of their formation and repair, and developing them as biomarkers of aging and disease.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Molecular Modelling of Resveratrol Derivatives with SIRT1 for the Stimulation of Deacetylase Activity.",
        "AbstractText": "Resveratrol is a polyphenol that is found in plants and has been proposed to have a potential therapeutic effect through the activation of SIRT1, which is a crucial member of the mammalian NAD+-dependent deacetylases. However, how its activity is enhanced toward specific substrates by resveratrol derivatives has not been studied. This study aimed to evaluate the types of interaction of resveratrol and its derivatives with SIRT1 as the target protein, as well as to find out the best ligand with the strangest interaction with SIRT1. In this study, we employed the extensive molecular docking analysis using AutoDock Vina to comparatively evaluate the interactions of resveratrol derivatives (22 molecules from the ZINC database) as ligands with SIRT1 (PDB ID: 5BTR) as a receptor. The ChemDraw and Chem3D tools were used to prepare 3D structures of all ligands and energetically minimize them by the MM2 force field. The molecular docking and visualizations showed that conformational change in resveratrol derivatives significantly influenced the parameter for docking results. Several types of interactions, including conventional hydrogen bonds, carbon-hydrogen bonds, Pi-donor hydrogen bonds, and Pi-Alkyl, were found via docking analysis of resveratrol derivatives and SIRT1 receptors. The possible activation effect of resveratrol 4'-(6-Galloylglucoside) with ZINC ID: ZINC230079516 with higher binding energy score (-46.8608 kJ/mol) to the catalytic domain (CD) of SIRT1 was achieved at the maximum value for SIRT1, as compared to resveratrol and its other derivatives. Finally, resveratrol 4'-(6-Galloylglucoside), as a derivative for resveratrol, has stably interacted with the CD of SIRT1 and might be a potential effective activator for SIRT1.",

        "AbstractText": "High-throughput technologies and machine learning (ML), when applied to a huge pool of medical data such as omics data, result in efficient analysis. Recent research aims to apply and develop ML models to predict a disease well in time using available omics datasets. The present work proposed a framework, 'OmicPredict', deploying a hybrid feature selection method and deep neural network (DNN) model to predict multiple diseases using omics data. The hybrid feature selection method is developed using the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) technique and firefly algorithm. The OmicPredict framework is applied to three case studies, Alzheimer's disease, Breast cancer, and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the case study of Alzheimer's disease, the framework predicts patients using GSE33000 and GSE44770 dataset. In the case study of Breast cancer, the framework predicts human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) subtype status using Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset. In the case study of COVID-19, the framework performs patients' classification using GSE157103 dataset. The experimental results show that DNN model achieved an Area Under Curve (AUC) score of 0.949 for the Alzheimer's (GSE33000 and GSE44770) dataset. Furthermore, it achieved an AUC score of 0.987 and 0.989 for breast cancer (METABRIC) and COVID-19 (GSE157103) datasets, respectively, outperforming Random Forest, Na\u00efve Bayes models, and the existing research.",

        "AbstractText": "Blood biomarkers can improve drug development for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its treatment. Neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) in plasma offer a minimally invasive platform for developing novel biomarkers that may be used to monitor the diverse pathogenic processes involved in AD. However, NDEVs comprise only a minor fraction of circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs). Most published studies have leveraged the L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) for NDEV immunocapture. We aimed to develop and optimize an alternative, highly specific immunoaffinity method to enrich blood NDEVs for biomarker development. After screening multiple neuronal antigens, we achieved NDEV capture with high affinity and specificity using antibodies against Growth-Associated Protein (GAP) 43 and Neuroligin 3 (NLGN3). The EV identity of the captured material was confirmed by electron microscopy, western blotting, and proteomics. The specificity for neuronal origin was demonstrated by showing enrichment for neuronal markers (proteins, mRNA) and recovery of spiked neuronal EVs. We performed NDEV isolation retrospectively from plasma samples from two cohorts of early AD patients (N = 19 and N = 40) and controls (N = 20 and N = 19) and measured p181-Tau, amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) 42, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), precursor brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF), glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2), postsynaptic density protein (PSD) 95, GAP43, and syntaxin-1. p181-Tau, A\u03b242, and NRGN were elevated in AD samples, whereas proBDNF, GluR2, PSD95, GAP43, and Syntaxin-1 were reduced. Differences for p181-Tau, proBDNF, and GluR2 survived multiple-comparison correction and were correlated with cognitive scores. A model incorporating biomarkers correctly classified 94.7% of AD participants and 61.5% of control participants. The observed differences in NDEVs-associated biomarkers are consistent with previous findings. NDEV isolation by GAP43 and NLGN3 immunocapture offers a robust novel platform for biomarker development in AD, suitable for large-scale validation.",

Only one study, using national administrative health databases, assessed and demonstrated that chronic pain (all types of pain) was a risk factor for dementia, but without assessing the impact of pain medications. To assess the impact of all types of chronic pain and the long-term use of pain medications on the person-years incidence of ADRD, a retrospective nationwide healthcare administrative data study was performed using the national inter-regime health insurance information system (SNIIRAM) to the French national health data system (SNDS). Incident people >50 years old with chronic pain, defined by at least 6-months duration analgesics treatment or by a diagnosis/long-term illness of chronic pain between 2006 and 2010, were included. Chronic pain individuals were matched with non-CP individuals by a propensity score. Individuals were followed up from 9 to 13 years to identify occurrences of ADRD from 2006. Among 64,496 French individuals, the incidence of ADRD was higher in the chronic pain population than control (1.13% vs. 0.95%, p <0.001). Chronic pain increases the risk of ADRD (HR = 1.23) and the incidence of ADRD was higher for women and increased significantly with age. Our study highlights the importance of prevention, diagnosis, and management of chronic pain in elderly to reduce the risk of development and/or worsening of dementia.",

        "AbstractText": "Vacuolar protein sorting 10 protein (VPS10P) domain receptors are a unique class of intracellular sorting receptors that emerge as major risk factors associated with psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, including bipolar disorders, autism, schizophrenia, as well as Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Yet, the lack of suitable experimental models to study receptor functions in the human brain has hampered elucidation of receptor actions in brain disease. Here, we have adapted protocols using human cerebral organoids to the detailed characterization of VPS10P domain receptor expression during neural development and differentiation, including single-cell RNA sequencing. Our studies uncovered spatial and temporal patterns of expression unique to individual receptor species in the human brain. While SORL1 expression is abundant in stem cells and SORCS1 peaks in neural progenitors at onset of neurogenesis, SORT1 and SORCS2 show increasing expression with maturation of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types, arguing for distinct functions in development versus the adult brain. In neurons, subcellular localization also distinguishes between types of receptor species, either mainly localized to the cell soma (SORL1 and SORT1) or also to neuronal projections (SORCS1 and SORCS2), suggesting divergent functions in protein sorting between Golgi and the endo-lysosomal system or along axonal and dendritic tracks. Taken together, our findings provide an important resource on temporal, spatial, and subcellular patterns of VPS10P domain receptor expression in cerebral organoids for further elucidation of receptor (dys) functions causative of behavioral and cognitive defects of the human brain.",

        "AbstractText": "Introduction: Progressive Tau deposition in neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads is the hallmark of tauopathies, a disorder group that includes Alzheimer's disease. Since Tau is a microtubule-associated protein, a prevalent concept to explain the pathogenesis of tauopathies is that abnormal Tau modification contributes to dissociation from microtubules, assembly into multimeric \u03b2-sheets, proteotoxicity, neuronal dysfunction and cell loss. Tau also localizes in the cell nucleus and evidence supports an emerging function of Tau in DNA stability and epigenetic modulation. Methods: To better characterize the possible role of Tau in regulation of chromatin compaction and subsequent gene expression, we performed a bioinformatics analysis of transcriptome data obtained from Tau-depleted human neuroblastoma cells. Results: Among the transcripts deregulated in a Tau-dependent manner, we found an enrichment of target genes for the polycomb repressive complex 2. We further describe decreased cellular amounts of the core components of the polycomb repressive complex 2 and lower histone 3 trimethylation in Tau deficient cells. Among the de-repressed polycomb repressive complex 2 target gene products, IGFBP3 protein was found to be linked to increased senescence induction in Tau-deficient cells. Discussion: Our findings propose a mechanism for Tau-dependent epigenetic modulation of cell senescence, a key event in pathologic aging.",

        "AbstractText": "GABAergic inhibitory neurons are the principal source of inhibition in the brain. Traditionally, their role in maintaining the balance of excitation-inhibition has been emphasized. Beyond homeostatic functions, recent circuit mapping and functional manipulation studies have revealed a wide range of specific roles that GABAergic circuits play in dynamically tilting excitation-inhibition coupling across spatio-temporal scales. These span from gating of compartment- and input-specific signaling, gain modulation, shaping input-output functions and synaptic plasticity, to generating signal-to-noise contrast, defining temporal windows for integration and rate codes, as well as organizing neural assemblies, and coordinating inter-regional synchrony. GABAergic circuits are thus instrumental in controlling single-neuron computations and behaviorally-linked network activity. The activity dependent modulation of sensory and mnemonic information processing by GABAergic circuits is pivotal for the formation and maintenance of episodic memories in the hippocampus. Here, we present an overview of the local and long-range GABAergic circuits that modulate the dynamics of excitation-inhibition and disinhibition in the main output area of the hippocampus CA1, which is crucial for episodic memory. Specifically, we link recent findings pertaining to GABAergic neuron molecular markers, electrophysiological properties, and synaptic wiring with their function at the circuit level. Lastly, given that area CA1 is particularly impaired during early stages of Alzheimer's disease, we emphasize how these GABAergic circuits may contribute to and be involved in the pathophysiology.",

        "AbstractText": "Irregular word reading has been used to estimate premorbid intelligence in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. However, reading models highlight the core influence of semantic abilities on irregular word reading, which shows early decline in AD. The general aim of this study is to determine whether irregular word reading is a valid estimate of premorbid intelligence, or a marker of cognitive and semantic decline in AD. 681 healthy controls (HC), 104 subjective cognitive decline, 290 early and 589 late mild cognitive impairment (EMCI, LMCI) and 348 AD participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were included. Irregular word reading was assessed with the American National Adult Reading Test (AmNART). Multiple linear regressions were conducted predicting AmNART score using diagnostic category, general cognitive impairment and semantic tests. A generalized logistic mixed-effects model predicted correct reading using extracted psycholinguistic characteristics of each AmNART words. Deformation-based morphometry was used to assess the relationship between AmNART scores and voxel-wise brain volumes, as well as with the volume of a region of interest placed in the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL). EMCI, LMCI and AD patients made significantly more errors in reading irregular words compared to HC, and AD patients made more errors than all other groups. Across the AD continuum, as well as within each diagnostic group, irregular word reading was significantly correlated to measures of general cognitive impairment / dementia severity. Neuropsychological tests of lexicosemantics were moderately correlated to irregular word reading whilst executive functioning and episodic memory were respectively weakly and not correlated. Age of acquisition, a primarily semantic variable, had a strong effect on irregular word reading accuracy whilst none of the phonological variables significantly contributed. Neuroimaging analyses pointed to bilateral hippocampal and left ATL volume loss as the main contributors to decreased irregular word reading performances. Irregular word reading performances decline throughout the AD continuum, and therefore, premorbid intelligence estimates based on the AmNART should not be considered accurate in MCI or AD. Results are consistent with the theory of irregular word reading impairments as an indicator of disease severity and semantic decline.",

        "AbstractText": "Prior to a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, many individuals experience cognitive and behavioral fluctuations that are not detected during a single session of traditional neuropsychological assessment. Mobile applications now enable high-frequency cognitive data to be collected remotely, introducing new opportunities and challenges. Emerging evidence suggests cognitively impaired older adults are capable of completing mobile assessments frequently, but no study has observed whether completion rates vary by assessment frequency or adherence type. Thirty-three older adults were recruited from the Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (mean age = 73.5 years; 27.3% cognitively impaired; 57.6% female; 81.8% White, 18.2% Black). Participants remotely downloaded and completed the DANA Brain Vital application on their own mobile devices throughout the study. The study schedule included seventeen assessments to be completed over the course of a year. Specific periods during which assessments were expected to be completed were defined as subsegments, while segments consisted of multiple subsegments. The first segment included three subsegments to be completed within one week, the second segment included weekly subsegments and spanned three weeks, and the third and fourth segments included monthly subsegments spanning five and six months, respectively. Three distinct adherence types - subsegment adherence, segment adherence, and cumulative adherence - were examined to determine how completion rates varied depending on assessment frequency and adherence type. Adherence type significantly impacted whether the completion rates declined. When utilizing subsegment adherence, the completion rate significantly declined (p = 0.05) during the fourth segment. However, when considering completion rates from the perspective of segment adherence, a decline in completion rate was not observed. Overall adherence rates increased as adherence parameters were broadened from subsegment adherence (60.6%) to segment adherence (78.8%), to cumulative adherence (90.9%). Older adults, including those with cognitive impairment, are able to complete remote cognitive assessments at a high-frequency, but may not necessarily adhere to prescribed schedules.",

        "AbstractText": "Previous study shows that monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which is implicated in the peripheral proinflammatory cascade and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, modulates the genetic risks of AD in established AD loci. In this study, we hypothesized that blood MCP-1 impacts the AD risk of genetic variants beyond known AD loci. We thus performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the logistic regression via generalized estimating equations (GEE) and the Cox proportional-hazards models to examine the interactive effects between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and blood MCP-1 level on AD in three cohorts: the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). We identified SNPs in two genes, neuron navigator 3 (NAV3, also named Unc-53 Homolog 3, rs696468) (p < 7.55\u00d710- 9) and Unc-5 Netrin Receptor C (UNC5C rs72659964) (p < 1.07\u00d710- 8) that showed an association between increasing levels of blood MCP-1 and AD. Elevating blood MCP-1 concentrations increased AD risk and AD pathology in genotypes of NAV3 (rs696468-CC) and UNC5C (rs72659964-AT + TT), but did not influence the other counterpart genotypes of these variants. NAV3 and UNC5C are homologs and may increase AD risk through dysregulating the functions of neurite outgrowth and guidance. Overall, the association of risk alleles of NAV3 and UNC5C with AD is enhanced by peripheral MCP-1 level, suggesting that lowering the level of blood MCP-1 may reduce the risk of developing AD for people with these genotypes.",

We assessed the association of small vessel disease (SVD) and amyloid burden with cognitive functioning in 47 non-demented older adults with type-2 diabetes from the Israel Diabetes and Cognitive Decline Study (mean age 78Y, 64% females). FLAIR-MRI, Vizamyl amyloid-PET, and T1W-MRI quantified white matter hyperintensities as a measure of SVD, amyloid burden, and gray matter (GM) volume, respectively. Mean hemoglobin A1c levels and duration of type-2 diabetes were used as measures of diabetic control. Cholesterol level and blood pressure were used as measures of cardiovascular risk. A broad neuropsychological battery assessed cognition. Linear regression models revealed that both higher SVD and amyloid burden were associated with lower cognitive functioning. Additional adjustments for type-2 diabetes-related characteristics, GM volume, and cardiovascular risk did not alter the results. The association of amyloid with cognition remained unchanged after further adjustment for SVD. Our findings suggest that SVD and amyloid pathology may independently contribute to lower cognitive functioning in non-demented older adults with type-2 diabetes, supporting a multimodal approach for diagnosing, preventing, and treating cognitive decline in this population.",

        "AbstractText": "Auditory dysfunction, including central auditory hyperactivity, hearing loss and hearing in noise deficits, has been reported in 5xFAD Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice, suggesting a causal relationship between amyloidosis and auditory dysfunction. Central auditory hyperactivity correlated in time with small amounts of plaque deposition in the inferior colliculus and medial geniculate body, which are the auditory midbrain and thalamus, respectively. Neuroinflammation has been associated with excitation to inhibition imbalance in the central nervous system, and therefore has been proposed as a link between central auditory hyperactivity and AD in our previous report. However, neuroinflammation in the auditory pathway has not been investigated in mouse amyloidosis models. Machine learning was used to classify the previously obtained auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) from 5xFAD mice and their wild type (WT) littermates. Neuroinflammation was assessed in six auditory-related regions of the cortex, thalamus, and brainstem. Cochlear pathology was assessed in cryosection and whole mount. Behavioral changes were assessed with fear conditioning, open field testing and novel objection recognition. Reliable machine learning classification of 5xFAD and WT littermate ABRs were achieved for 6M and 12M, but not 3M. The top features for accurate classification at 6 months of age were characteristics of Waves IV and V. Microglial and astrocytic activation were pronounced in 5xFAD inferior colliculus and medial geniculate body at 6 months, two neural centers that are thought to contribute to these waves. Lower regions of the brainstem were unaffected, and cortical auditory centers also displayed inflammation beginning at 6 months. No losses were seen in numbers of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), auditory synapses, or efferent synapses in the cochlea. 5xFAD mice had reduced responses to tones in fear conditioning compared to WT littermates beginning at 6 months. Serial use of ABR in early AD patients represents a promising approach for early and inexpensive detection of neuroinflammation in higher auditory brainstem processing centers. As changes in auditory processing are strongly linked to AD progression, central auditory hyperactivity may serve as a biomarker for AD progression and/or stratify AD patients into distinct populations.",

Our results unveiled a significant genetic overlap between AD and 11 individual immune-mediated diseases despite negligible genetic correlations, suggesting a complex shared genetic architecture distributed across the genome.

Top biological pathways enriched with these identified shared genes were related to the immune system and cell adhesion. In addition, in silico single-cell analyses showed enrichment of immune and brain cells, including neurons and microglia. In summary, our results suggest a genetic relationship between AD and the 11 immune-mediated diseases, pinpointing the existence of a shared however non-causal genetic basis.

        "AbstractText": "Melanin, a ubiquitous dark pigment, plays important roles in the immune system, including scavenging reactive oxygen species formed in response to ultraviolet radiation absorption, absorbing metals, thermal regulation, drug uptake, innate immune system functions, redox, and energy transduction. Many tissue types, including brain, heart, arteries, ovaries, and others, contain melanin. Almost all cells contain precursors to melanin. A growing number of diseases in which there is a loss of melanin and/or neuromelanin are increasingly thought to have infectious etiologies, for example, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), and vitiligo. AD, PD, LBD, and vitiligo have been linked with herpesvirus, which enters melanosomes and causes apoptosis, and with gut dysbiosis and inflammation. Herpesvirus is also linked with gut dysbiosis and inflammation. We theorize that under normal healthy states, melanin retains some of the energy it absorbs from electromagnetic radiation, which is then used to fuel cells, and energy from ATP is used to compliment that energy supply. We further theorize that loss of melanin reduces the energy supply of cells, which in the case of AD, PD, and LBD results in an inability to sustain immune system defenses and remove the plaques associated with the disease, which appear to be part of the immune system's attempt to eradicate the pathogens seen in these neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, in an attempt to explain why removing these plaques does not result in improvements in cognition and mood and why cognitions and moods in these individuals have ebbs and flows, we postulate that it is not the plaques that cause the cognitive symptoms but, rather, inflammation in the brain resulting from the immune system's response to pathogens. Our theory that energy retained in melanin fuels cells in an inverse relationship with ATP is supported by studies showing alterations in ATP production in relationship to melanin levels in melanomas, vitiligo, and healthy cells. Therefore, alteration of melanin levels may be at the core of many diseases. We propose regulating melanin levels may offer new avenues for treatment development.",

The 3D NURBS-based HUman Brain (NHUB) phantom was used in the analytical simulation to model 99mTc-HMPAO and 99mTc-TRODAT distributions. The 2D Derenzo hot-rod phantom and star phantom were used in Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the spatial resolution and angular sampling performance of MPH. The influence of different detector positions was also evaluated for 2, 4, and 6 angular views. The projections were reconstructed using the 3D MPH ML-EM method. Normalized mean square error, coefficient of variation, and image profiles were evaluated. Along with the decrease in the number of projections, more pinholes are required to achieve the optimum performance. For 32 projections, 9- and 7-pinhole collimators provide the best normalized mean square error (NMSE) to the coefficient of variation (COV) trade-off for 99mTc-HMPAO and 99mTc-TRODAT, respectively. Detector positions substantially affect the image quality for MPH SPECT for 2 and 4 angular views. The smallest rod size for the Derenzo hot-rod phantom, which could be resolved, is 7.9 mm for the MPH general purpose collimator (MPGP) with more than 16 projections and 6.4 mm for MPH high-resolution collimator (MPHR) with more than 8 projections. The number of pinholes affects the performance of the MPH collimator, especially when the projection views become fewer. More pinholes are required for fewer projections to provide better angular sampling in MPH for complex activity distributions. Detector positions affect the image quality of MPH SPECT for 2 and 4 angular views, where L-mode acquisition is slightly superior to H-mode. MPH collimators exhibited improved spatial resolution and angular sampling compared with both LEHR and single pinhole collimators.",

        "AbstractText": "Transfemoral aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is the standard treatment for elderly patients with aortic valve stenosis. Although safe and well-established, there is a risk of intraprocedural hemodynamic instability and silent cerebral embolism, which can lead to a decline in neurocognitive function and dementia. In clinical practice, comprehensive cognitive testing is difficult to perform. AI-assisted digital applications may help to optimize diagnosis and monitoring. Neurocognitive function was assessed by validated psychometric tests using \"\u2206elta -App\", which uses artificial intelligence and computational linguistic methods for extraction and analysis. Memory function was assessed using the 'Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease' (CERAD) word list and digit span task (DST) before TAVR and before hospital discharge. The study is registered in the German Register of Clinical Trials (https://drks.de/search/de/trial/DRKS00020813). From October 2020 until March 2022, 141 patients were enrolled at University Hospital Heart Centre Brandenburg. Mean age was 81 \u00b1 6 years, 42.6% were women. Time between the pre- and post-interventional test was on average 6 \u00b1 3 days. Memory function before TAVR was found to be below average in relation to age and educational level. The pre-post TAVR comparison showed significant improvements in the wordlist repeat, P < 0.001 and wordlist recall test of CERAD, P < 0.001. There were no changes in the digital span test. Despite impaired preoperative memory function before TAVR, no global negative effect on memory function after TVAR was detected. The improvements shown in the word list test should be interpreted as usual learning effects in this task.",

TBI ranges from mild to severe and is a recognized risk factor for later neurodegenerative conditions including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD). The development of CTE is typically associated with repetitive exposure to mild TBI (mTBI), while a single moderate-to-severe TBI is considered a risk factor for AD and PD. Polypathology is common, and the lines between these conditions post TBI can be somewhat blurred. The mechanisms through which TBI leads to future neurodegeneration are not well understood. Heterogeneity and distance from the injury or injuries and individual genetic and environmental factors make clinical studies difficult. We present the case of an 82-year-old man who died 4 years after developing a phenotypically mixed dementia with neuropsychiatric features and parkinsonism. He had a remote history of a severe TBI 40 years prior, following a road traffic accident which caused a large right frontal injury, requiring neurosurgical intervention. Post-mortem neuropathological examination demonstrated abnormal phosphorylated-Tau (p-Tau), beta-amyloid plaques (A\u03b2) and \u03b1-synuclein deposition. Spatial immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated increased perivascular accumulation of p-Tau with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption at the site of injury, which decreased with distance from the injury site. The appearances are suggestive of initial vascular disruption with persisting BBB disruption as a driver of the pathology.",

The aim was to evaluate the presence of psychotic symptoms using detailed scales and to assess the association with clinical characteristics. Healthy controls and patients within three years of PD onset were recruited. Participants were examined for psychotic symptoms using two different instruments: the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS) and a 10 question PD specific psychosis severity scale (10PDQ). In the PD group, medication use, motor and non-motor symptoms were documented. Based on CAARMS and 10PDQ scales, psychotic features were present in 39% (27/70) of patients and 4% (3/74) of controls. The prevalence of passage hallucinations and illusions was significantly higher in PD compared to the control group. The presence of PD-associated psychotic features was not significantly affected by medication, motor severity or global cognitive status. Higher prevalence of overall non-motor manifestations, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and depressive symptoms was significantly associated with the manifestation of psychotic features in PD [(adjusted OR:1.3; 95% CI:1.1-1.6; p\u200a=\u200a0.003), (adjusted OR:1.3; 95% CI:1.0-1.6; p\u200a=\u200a0.023), and (adjusted OR:1.2; 95% CI:1.0-1.4;p\u200a=\u200a0.026)].

Biochemical, clinical, lipid, and inflammatory profiles were measured. oA\u03b2 and cEVs interaction was determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis and proteinase K digestion. cEVs bound proteins were determined by ELISA. oA\u03b2 were trapped by cEVs and were topologically bound to their external surface. We identified surface-exposed proteins functionally able to conjugate oA\u03b2 including apolipoprotein J (apoJ), apoE and RAGE, with apoJ being 30- to 130-fold higher than RAGE and apoE, respectively. The expression of cEVs apoJ was significantly lower in Pre-AD up to 5 years before AD onset. Our findings suggest that cEVs might participate in oA\u03b2 clearance and that early dysregulation of cEVs could increase the risk of conversion to AD.",

Some clinical and animal research revealed that AD combined with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) exacerbates AD progression by inducing blood-brain barrier dysfunction and fibrinogen deposition. Rivaroxaban, an anticoagulant, has been shown to reduce the rates of dementia in atrial fibrillation patients, but its effects on white matter and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. The main purpose of this study was to explore the therapeutic effect of rivaroxaban on the white matter of AD+CCH mice. In this study, the therapeutic effects of rivaroxaban on white matter in a mouse AD+CCH model were investigated to explore the potential mechanisms involving fibrinogen deposition, inflammation, and oxidative stress on remyelination in white matter. The results indicate that rivaroxaban significantly attenuated fibrinogen deposition, fibrinogen-related microglia activation, oxidative stress, and enhanced demyelination in AD+CCH mice, leading to improved white matter integrity, reduced axonal damage, and restored myelin loss. These findings suggest that long-term administration of rivaroxaban might reduce the risk of dementia.",

However, their interaction has rarely been studied. To study the association between subjective memory complaints and family history of dementia with regard to the own subsequent risk of dementia. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses over a follow-up period of up to 13 years were conducted in a population sample of participants without dementia at baseline (n = 3,256, mean age = 79.62 years), using group comparisons and Cox proportional hazards models. Cross-sectionally, participants with subjective memory complaints were significantly more likely to report family history of dementia. Longitudinally, family history of dementia (FH) was significantly associated with subsequent dementia in the subjective memory complaints (SMC) group, but not in those without SMC. A relative excess risk due to interaction analysis confirmed a significant FHxSMC-interaction. Family history of dementia was a predictor of incident dementia in those with SMC, which can serve as an additional, clinically relevant criterion to gauge the risk of dementia in older-aged subjects with SMC with and without objective cognitive impairment.",

Personalized, multimodal therapies are needed to best prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Coaching for Cognition in Alzheimer's (COCOA) trial was a prospective randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that a remotely coached multimodal lifestyle intervention would improve early-stage AD. Participants with early-stage AD were randomized into two arms. Arm 1 (N\u200a=\u200a24) received standard of care. Arm 2 (N\u200a=\u200a31) additionally received telephonic personalized coaching for multiple lifestyle interventions. The primary outcome was a test of the hypothesis that the Memory Performance Index (MPI) change over time would be better in the intervention arm than in the control arm. The Functional Assessment Staging Test was assessed for a secondary outcome. COCOA collected psychometric, clinical, lifestyle, genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and microbiome data at multiple timepoints (dynamic dense data) across two years for each participant. The intervention arm ameliorated 2.1 [1.0] MPI points (mean [SD], p\u200a=\u200a0.016) compared to the control over the two-year intervention. No important adverse events or side effects were observed. Multimodal lifestyle interventions are effective for ameliorating cognitive decline and have a larger effect size than pharmacological interventions. Dietary changes and exercise are likely to be beneficial components of multimodal interventions in many individuals. Remote coaching is an effective intervention for early stage ADRD.

To explore the socioeconomic disparity in long-term care for PWD. This registry-based study included 14,786 PWD, registered in the Swedish registry for cognitive and dementia disorders (2014-2016). Education and income, two traditional socioeconomic indicators, were the main exposure. Outcomes were any kind of long-term care, specific types of long-term care (home care, institutional care), and the monthly average hours of home care. The association between outcomes and socioeconomic status was examined with zero-inflated negative binomial regression and binary logistic regression. PWD with compulsory education had lower likelihood of receiving any kind of long-term care (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.93), or home care (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.97), compared to individuals with university degrees. Their monthly average hours of home care were 0.70 times (95% CI 0.59-0.82) lower than those of persons with university degrees. There was no significant association between education and the receipt of institutional care. Stratifying on persons with Alzheimer's disease showed significant association between lower education and any kind of long-term care, and between income and the hours of home care. Socioeconomic inequalities in long-term care existed in this study population. Lower-educated PWD were less likely to acquire general long-term care, home care and had lower hours of home care, compared to their higher-educated counterparts.

Since spinal A\u03b2 were absent in the first 165 cases, it was not assessed in the remaining cases. Age at death was 91 years old. About 90% had A\u03b2 in cerebrum and of these, half had A\u03b2 in the brainstem. Of the latter, 85% showed A\u03b2 in the olfactory bulb. All but one participant had tau-tangles in the cerebrum and 86% had brainstem tau-tangles. Of the latter, 80% had tau-tangles in olfactory bulb and 36% tau-tangles in one or more spinal cord levels.

To rank the effects of potentially dependent risk factors and identify an optimal parsimonious set of measures for predicting AD/ADRD risk from a larger pool of potentially correlated predictors. We used diagnosis record, survey, and genetic data from the Health and Retirement Study to assess the relative predictive strength of AD/ADRD risk factors spanning several domains: comorbidities, demographics/socioeconomics, health-related behavior, genetics, and environmental exposure. A modified stepwise-AIC-best-subset blanket algorithm was then used to select an optimal set of predictors. The final predictive model was reduced to 10 features for AD and 19 for ADRD; concordance statistics were about 0.85 for one-year and 0.70 for ten-year follow-up. Depression, arterial hypertension, traumatic brain injury, cerebrovascular diseases, and the APOE4 proxy SNP rs769449 had the strongest individual associations with AD/ADRD risk. AD/ADRD risk-related co-morbidities provide predictive power on par with key genetic vulnerabilities. Results confirm the consensus that circulatory diseases are the main comorbidities associated with AD/ADRD risk and show that clinical diagnosis records outperform comparable self-reported measures in predicting AD/ADRD risk. Model construction algorithms combined with modern data allows researchers to conserve power (especially in the study of disparities where disadvantaged groups are often grossly underrepresented) while accounting for a high proportion of AD/ADRD-risk-related population heterogeneity stemming from multiple domains.",

Therefore, real-time and accurate monitoring of Hg2+ in environmental samples is crucial. In this study, we report a photoluminescent (PL) and electrochemiluminescent (ECL) probe based on a cyclometalated Ir(III) complex for the selective detection of Hg2+. The introduction of a reaction site, o-aminomethylphenylboronic acid, on the ancillary ligands allowed a prompt transmetalation reaction to take place between Hg2+ and boronic acid. This reaction resulted in significant decreases of the PL and ECL signals due to the photo-induced electron transfer from the Ir(III) complex to the Hg2+ ions. The probe was applied to the selective detection of Hg2+, and the signal changes revealed a linear correlation with Hg2+ concentrations in the range of 0-10 \u03bcM (LOD = 0.72 \u03bcM for PL, 8.03 nM for ECL).

When the personality changes become noticeable, involuntary movements (chorea) also develop. The disease is caused by the CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of the HTT gene, and the diagnosis is based on the presence of this expansion. However, there is currently no effective treatment for the progression of Huntington's disease and its involuntary motor symptoms. Herein, we present a case in which memantine was effective in treating the chorea movements of Huntington's disease. A 75-year-old Japanese woman presented to the hospital with involuntary movements of Huntington's disease that began when she was 73\u00a0years old. In a cerebral blood flow test (N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine-single-photon emission computed tomography), decreased blood flow was observed in the precuneus (anterior wedge) and posterior cingulate gyrus. Usually, such areas of decreased blood flow are observed in patients with Alzheimer's-type dementia. So, we administered memantine for Alzheimer's-type dementia, and this treatment suppressed the involuntary movements of Huntington's disease, and the symptoms progressed slowly for 7\u00a0years after the onset of senility. In contrast, her brother died of complications of pneumonia during the course of Huntington's disease. We recorded changes in parameters such as the results of the N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine-single-photon emission computed tomography and gait videos over 7\u00a0years. Treatment with memantine prevented the chorea movement and the progression of Huntington's disease.

Outcome measures were ED length of stay (LOS) and, in patients admitted to Geriatrics, weight of the Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG), hospital LOS, and mortality. 7,270 patients were enrolled in the pre-DSC and 4,725 in the post-DSC phase.

We followed a cohort of 78 patients with a manic episode without mixed symptoms (bipolar type I or schizoaffective disorder) at 2-4-6-9-12-15-18 months and up to 10 years. Within a cross-validation scheme, we created and evaluated a Cox lasso model to estimate the risk of manic relapse using both clinical and MRI data. The model successfully estimated the risk of manic relapse (Cox regression of the time to relapse as a function of the estimated risk: hazard ratio (HR)=2.35, p=0.027; area under the curve (AUC)=0.65, expected calibration error (ECE)<0.2). The most relevant variables included in the model were the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, poor impulse control, unusual thought content, and cerebellum volume decrease. The estimations were poorer when we used clinical or MRI data separately. Combining clinical and MRI data may improve the risk of manic relapse estimation after a manic episode.

Twenty derivatives of diversely annelated eight-to-nine-membered azaheterocyclic ring, prepared through domino reaction of the respective tetrahydropyridine and azepine with activated alkynes, were assayed for the inhibitory activity against AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). As a major outcome, compound 7c, an alkylamino derivative of tetrahydropyrimido[4,5-d]azocine, was found to be a highly potent BChE-selective inhibitor, which showed a noncompetitive/mixed-type inhibition mechanism against human BChE with single digit nanomolar inhibition constant (Ki\u00a0=\u00a07.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0nM). The four-order magnitude BChE-selectivity of 7c clearly reflects the effect of lipophilicity upon binding to the BChE binding cavity. The ChEs' inhibition data, interpreted by chemoinformatic tools and an in-depth in-silico study (molecular docking combined with molecular dynamics calculations), not only highlighted key structural factors enhancing inhibition potency and selectivity toward BChE, but also shed light on subtle differences distinguishing the binding sites of equine BChE from the recombinant human BChE. Compound 7c inhibited P-glycoprotein with IC50 of 0.27\u00a0\u03bcM, which may support its ability to permeate blood-brain barrier, and proved to be no cytotoxic in human liver cancer cell line (HepG2) at the BChE bioactive concentrations.

Aging is a complex biological process concurrently shaped by genetic, dietary and environmental factors and natural compounds are emerging for their beneficial effects against age-related disorders. Besides their antioxidant activity often described in simple model organisms, the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of different dietary compounds remain however largely unknown. In the present study, we exploit the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a widely established model for aging studies, to test the effects of different natural compounds in vivo and focused on mechanistic aspects of one of them, quercetin, using complementary systems and assays. We show that quercetin has evolutionarily conserved beneficial effects against Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology: it prevents Amyloid beta (A\u03b2)-induced detrimental effects in different C. elegans AD models and it reduces A\u03b2-secretion in mammalian cells. Mechanistically, we found that the beneficial effects of quercetin are mediated by autophagy-dependent reduced expression of Abl tyrosine kinase. In turn, autophagy is required upon Abl suppression to mediate quercetin's protective effects against A\u03b2 toxicity. Our data support the power of C. elegans as an in vivo model to investigate therapeutic options for AD.",

Therefore, we investigated the relationships between A\u03b2 positivity and the development of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) in patients with small subcortical infarction. We prospectively recruited 37 patients aged \u2265 50 years, with first-ever small subcortical infarction, who underwent amyloid positron emission tomography, 3 months after stroke at Korea University Guro Hospital. We also enrolled CU participants matched for age and sex with stroke patients for comparison of A\u03b2 positivity. Patients were followed up at 3 and 12 months after the stroke to assess cognitive decline. Logistic and linear mixed-effect regression analyses were performed to identify the effect of A\u03b2 positivity on PSCI development and long-term cognitive trajectories. At 3 months after stroke, 12/37 (32.4%) patients developed PSCI, and 11/37 (29.7%) patients had A\u03b2 deposition. A\u03b2 positivity (odds ratio [OR] = 72.2, p = 0.024) was predictive of PSCI development regardless of cSVD burden.

However, only a limited percentage of the population has access to etiological confirmation, which has led to the emergence of peripheral fluid biomarkers as a diagnostic tool for dementias, including MCI due to AD. Recent advances in biofluid assays have enabled the use of sophisticated statistical models and multimodal machine learning (ML) algorithms for the diagnosis of MCI based on fluid biomarkers from CSF, peripheral blood, and saliva, among others. This approach has shown promise for identifying specific causes of MCI, including AD. After a PRISMA analysis, 29 articles revealed a trend towards using multimodal algorithms that incorporate additional biomarkers such as neuroimaging, neuropsychological tests, and genetic information. Particularly, neuroimaging is commonly used in conjunction with fluid biomarkers for both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Our systematic review suggests that cost-effective longitudinal multimodal monitoring data, representative of diverse cultural populations and utilizing white-box ML algorithms, could be a valuable contribution to the development of diagnostic models for AD due to MCI. Clinical assessment and biomarkers, together with ML techniques, could prove pivotal in improving diagnostic tools for MCI due to AD.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Determination of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II and secretory immunoglobulin A in saliva of patients with dementia.",
        "AbstractText": "The prevalence of pain and dementia increases with age, affecting a significant percentage of the population due to aging. Both pathologies are connected through the inflammatory process, specifically through the tumor necrosis factor. The effect of this cytokine is mediated through the modulation of its TNFRI and TNFRII receptors, which are linked to the dementia process. In addition, immunoglobulins such as secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) have been recognized as one of the main biomarkers of pain in saliva. sTNFRII and sIgA levels were determined in saliva samples by ELISA from healthy people and patients with dementia in GDS stages 5-7. The concentrations of these markers were also correlated with the GDS stage and sex. We observed a significant decrease (*** p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001) in the levels of sTNFRII (pg/mL) and a significant increase (** p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01) in the levels of sIgA (ng/mL) in the saliva of patients with dementia compared to the healthy control group. We did not observe a correlation with the data of the biomarkers regarding the GDS stage and sex. The results obtained for sTNFRII are consistent with those obtained by other authors on brain tissue, who conclude that unopposed neuronal TNFRI signaling, when TNFRII is selectively downregulated, leads to a more severe course of AD pathogenesis. Regarding sIgA, the elevated values of sIgA may reflect the immune status of these patients. Therefore, these biomarkers can provide us with relevant information through a non-invasive method such as saliva analysis.",

To better understand the effects of daytime napping on MCI patients, a study was conducted to measure the effects of short naps on cognitive function, sleep quality, and quality of life. In total, 38 participants were asked to take 20-minute naps between 1:00p.m. and 3:00p.m. three times a week for eight weeks. The cognitive function of the participants was measured using the Thai version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Thai-MoCA), their sleep quality was measured using the Thai version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Thai-PSQI), and their quality of life was measured using the Thai version of the Quality of Life (Thai-QoL) questionnaire. After the 8-week period, the participants' scores for the Thai-MoCA and the Thai-QoL questionnaire showed a significant improvement (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for both), while the Thai-PSQI decreased significantly (p\u00a0=\u00a00.012).

Meanwhile, major sporadic NDDs share many risk factors and exhibit similar pathologies in their early stages, indicating the existence of common initiation pathways. Glucose hypometabolism associated with oxidative stress is one such primary, early and shared pathology, and a likely major cause of detrimental disease-associated cascades; targeting this common pathology may therefore be an effective preventative strategy for most sporadic NDDs. However, its exact cause and trigger remain unclear. Recent research suggests that early oxidative stress caused by NADPH oxidase (NOX) activation is a shared initiating mechanism among major sporadic NDDs and could prove to be the long-sought ubiquitous NDD trigger. We focus on two major NDDs - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as on acquired epilepsy which is an increasingly recognized comorbidity in NDDs. We also discuss available data suggesting the relevance of the proposed mechanisms to other NDDs. We delve into the commonalities among these NDDs in neuroinflammation and NOX involvement to identify potential therapeutic targets and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying causes of NDDs.",

The purpose of this study was to determine whether chronic VitD deficiency in an AD mouse model caused persistent metabolite levels changes in the hippocampus associated with memory performance. Six-month-old APPSwe/PS1\u0394E9 (APP/PS1) mice (N\u00a0=\u00a014 mice/group) were fed either a VitD deficient (VitD-) diet or a control diet. Metabolite level changes in the hippocampus were evaluated by 1H MRS using a 9.4\u00a0T MRI. Ventricle volume was assessed by imaging and spatial memory was evaluated using the Barnes maze. All measurements were made at 6, 9, 12, and 15 months of age. At 15 months of age, amyloid plaque load and astrocyte number were evaluated histologically (N\u00a0=\u00a04 mice/group). Levels of N-acetyl aspartate and creatine were lower in VitD- mice compared to control diet mice at 12 months of age. VitD deficiency did not change ventricle volume. Lactate levels increased over time in VitD- mice and increases from 12 to 15 months were negatively correlated with changes in primary latency to the target hole in the Barns Maze. VitD- mice showed improved spatial memory performance compared to control diet mice. VitD- mice also had more astrocytes in the cortex and hippocampus at 15 months than control diet mice. This study suggests that severe VitD deficiency in APP/PS1 mice may lead to compensatory changes in metabolite and astrocyte levels that contribute to improved performance on spatial memory tasks.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Regulation of extracellular progranulin in medial prefrontal cortex.",
        "AbstractText": "Progranulin is a secreted pro-protein that has anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic effects and is necessary for maintaining lysosomal function. Mutations in progranulin (GRN) are a major cause of frontotemporal dementia. Most pathogenic GRN mutations cause progranulin haploinsufficiency, so boosting progranulin levels is a promising therapeutic strategy. Progranulin is constitutively secreted, then taken up and trafficked to lysosomes. Before being taken up from the extracellular space, progranulin interacts with receptors that may mediate anti-inflammatory and growth factor-like effects. Modifying progranulin trafficking is a viable approach to boosting progranulin, but progranulin secretion and uptake by cells in the brain is poorly understood and may involve distinct mechanisms from other parts of the body. Understanding the cell types and processes that regulate extracellular progranulin in the brain could provide insight into progranulin's mechanism of action and inform design of progranulin-boosting therapies. To address this question we used microdialysis to measure progranulin in interstitial fluid (ISF) of mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Grn+/- mice had approximately 50% lower ISF progranulin than wild-type mice, matching the reduction of progranulin in cortical tissue. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence confirmed that microglia and neurons are the major progranulin-expressing cell types in the mPFC. Studies of conditional microglial (Mg-KO) and neuronal (N-KO) Grn knockout mice revealed that loss of progranulin from either cell type results in approximately 50% reduction in ISF progranulin. LPS injection (i.p.) produced an acute increase in ISF progranulin in mPFC. Depolarizing cells with KCl increased ISF progranulin, but this response was not altered in N-KO mice, indicating progranulin secretion by non-neuronal cells. Increasing neuronal activity with picrotoxin did not increase ISF progranulin. These data indicate that microglia and neurons are the source of most ISF progranulin in mPFC, with microglia likely secreting more progranulin per cell than neurons. The acute increase in ISF progranulin after LPS treatment is consistent with a role for extracellular progranulin in regulating inflammation, and may have been driven by microglia or peripheral immune cells. Finally, these data indicate that mPFC neurons engage in constitutive progranulin secretion that is not acutely changed by neuronal activity.",

We sought to enhance the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of primary care clinicians caring for patients with BPSD through academic detailing, an evidence-based approach for persuading health care professionals to make changes in their practice. We implemented academic detailing among physicians and nurse practitioners in 2 primary care settings, one an urban center serving a largely Black community and another a rural center serving a largely white community, within primary care-integrated dementia diagnostic clinics.

As neuroinflammation is also a major pathological feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), RT may also be effective in PD treatment. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of low-moderate dose RT (LMDRT, 0.6\u00a0Gy/single dose, for 5\u00a0days) exposure in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; 30\u00a0mg/kg, intraperitoneally, for 5 consecutive days)-induced PD mouse model. Importantly, LMDRT reduced the levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (CD54) in the striatum region, which increased following MPTP administration. LMDRT also modulated inflammatory gene expression patterns in the substantia nigra region of the MPTP-treated mice. However, LMDRT had no direct effects on the severe loss of dopaminergic neurons and impaired motor behavior in the rotarod test. These results indicate that LMDRT has anti-inflammatory effects by modulating neuroinflammatory factors, including glial fibrillary acidic protein and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, but showed no behavioral improvements or neuroprotection in the MPTP-induced mouse model of PD.",

        "AbstractText": "Amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. In adult Drosophila brains, human A\u03b2 overexpression harms climbing and lifespan. It's uncertain whether A\u03b2 is intrinsically toxic or activates downstream neurodegeneration pathways. Our study uncovers a novel protective role against A\u03b2 toxicity: intra-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein accumulation with a focus on laminin and collagen subunits. Despite high A\u03b2, laminin B1 (LanB1) overexpression robustly counters toxicity, suggesting a potential A\u03b2 resistance mechanism. Other laminin subunits and collagen IV also alleviate A\u03b2 toxicity; combining them with LanB1 augments the effect. Imaging reveals ER retention of LanB1 without altering A\u03b2 secretion. LanB1's rescue function operates independently of the IRE1\u03b1/XBP1 ER stress response. ER-targeted GFP overexpression also mitigates A\u03b2 toxicity, highlighting broader ER protein retention advantages. Proof-of-principle tests in murine hippocampal slices using mouse Lamb1 demonstrate ER retention in transduced cells, indicating a conserved mechanism. Though ER protein retention generally harms, it could paradoxically counter neuronal A\u03b2 toxicity, offering a new therapeutic avenue for Alzheimer's disease.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global health problem in the medical sector that will increase over time. The limited treatment of AD leads to the search for a new clinical candidate. Considering the multifactorial nature of AD, a strategy targeting number of regulatory proteins involved in the development of the disease is an effective approach. Here, we present a discovery of new multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs), purposely designed as GABA transporter (GAT) inhibitors, that successfully provide the inhibitory activity against butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), \u03b2-secretase (BACE1), amyloid \u03b2 aggregation and calcium channel blockade activity. The selected GAT inhibitors, 19c and 22a - N-benzylamide derivatives of 4-aminobutyric acid, displayed the most prominent multifunctional profile. Compound 19c (mGAT1 IC50\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0\u03bcM, mGAT4 IC50\u00a0=\u00a012\u00a0\u03bcM and BuChE IC50\u00a0=\u00a0559\u00a0nM) possessed the highest hBACE1 and A\u03b240 aggregation inhibitory activity (IC50\u00a0=\u00a01.57\u00a0\u03bcM and 99\u00a0% at 10\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively). Additionally, it showed a decrease in both the elongation and nucleation constants of the amyloid aggregation process.

Performed molecular docking studies described the mode of interactions with GATs and enzymatic targets. In ADMET in vitro studies both compounds showed acceptable metabolic stability and low neurotoxicity. Successfully, compounds 19c and 22a at the dose of 30\u00a0mg/kg possessed statistically significant antiamnesic properties in a mouse model of amnesia caused by scopolamine and assessed in the novel object recognition (NOR) task or the passive avoidance (PA) task.",

To better understand this relationship in preclinical AD, we examined hippocampal volume and depressive symptoms in cognitively unimpaired carriers of the presenilin-1 (PSEN1) E280A mutation for autosomal dominant AD. A total of 27 PSEN1 mutation carriers and 26 non-carrier family members were included. Linear regression was used to test the relationship between hippocampal volume and 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale. Carriers and non-carriers did not differ in depressive symptoms or hippocampal volume. Within carriers, lower hippocampal volume was associated with greater depressive symptoms, which remained significant after adjusting for age and cognition. This relationship was not significant in non-carriers. Hippocampal neurodegeneration may underlie depressive symptoms in preclinical autosomal dominant AD. These findings provide support for the utility of targeting depressive symptoms in AD prevention. We compared unimpaired autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (AD) mutation carriers and non-carriers. Carriers and non-carriers did not differ in severity of depressive symptoms.

In stepwise regression analyses, we tested connectivity, MAPT gene expression, and amyloid-PET as predictors of group-averaged and individual tau-PET ROI values in amyloid-positive participants. Connectivity alone explained 21.8 to 39.2% (range across 3 studies) of the variance in tau-PET ROI values averaged across amyloid-positive participants. Stepwise addition of MAPT gene expression and amyloid-PET increased the proportion of explained variance to 30.2 to 46.0% and 45.0 to 49.9%, respectively.

If detected early, the disease's impact and prognosis can be altered significantly. Blood biosamples are often employed in simple medical testing since they are cost-effective and easy to collect and analyze. This research provides a diagnostic model for Alzheimer's disease based on federated learning (FL) and hardware acceleration using blood biosamples. We used blood biosample datasets provided by the ADNI website to compare and evaluate the performance of our models. FL has been used to train a shared model without sharing local devices' raw data with a central server to preserve privacy. We developed a hardware acceleration approach for building our FL model so that we could speed up the training and testing procedures. The VHDL hardware description language and an Altera 10 GX FPGA are utilized to construct the hardware-accelerator approach. The results of the simulations reveal that the proposed methods achieve accuracy and sensitivity for early detection of 89% and 87%, respectively, while simultaneously requiring less time to train than other algorithms considered to be state-of-the-art. The proposed algorithms have a power consumption ranging from 35 to 39 mW, which qualifies them for use in limited devices.

        "AbstractText": "Amyloid aggregates arise from either the partial or complete loss of the native protein structure or the inability of proteins to attain their native conformation. These aggregates have been linked to several diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and lysozyme amyloidosis. A comprehensive dataset was recently reported, demonstrating the critical role of the protein's surrounding environment in amyloid formation. In this study, we investigated the formation of lysozyme amyloid fibrils induced by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and the effect of solvents in the medium. Experimental data obtained through fluorescence spectroscopy revealed a notable lag phase in amyloid formation when acetone solution was present. This finding suggested that the presence of acetone in the reaction medium created an unfavorable microenvironment for amyloid fibril formation and impeded the organization of the denatured protein into the fibril form. The in silico data provided insights into the molecular mechanism of the interaction between acetone molecules and the lysozyme protofibril, once acetone presented the best experimental results. It was observed that the lysozyme protofibril became highly unstable in the presence of acetone, leading to the complete loss of its \u03b2-sheet conformation and resulting in an open structure. Furthermore, the solvation layer of the protofibril in acetone solution was significantly reduced compared to that in other solvents, resulting in fewer hydrogen bonds. Consequently, the presence of acetone facilitated the exposure of the hydrophobic portion of the protofibril, precluding the amyloid fibril formation. In summary, our study underscores the pivotal role the surrounding environment plays in influencing amyloid formation.",

Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) positively improve brain glucose metabolism and decrease the expression of AD-related proteins. However, the effects of the combined intervention are unclear. The present study explored the effects of the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA in improving brain glucose metabolism and decreasing AD-related protein expression levels in APP/PS1 mice. The mice were assigned into four dietary treatment groups: the control group, MCTs group, DHA group, and MCTs + DHA group. The corresponding diet of the respective groups was fed to mice from the age of 3 to 11 months. The results showed that the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA could increase serum octanoic acid (C8:0), decanoic acid (C10:0), DHA, and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (\u03b2-HB) levels; improve glucose metabolism; and reduce nerve cell apoptosis in the brain. Moreover, it also aided with decreasing the expression levels of amyloid beta protein (A\u03b2), amyloid precursor protein (APP), \u03b2-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1), and presenilin-1 (PS1) in the brain. Furthermore, the supplementation of MCTs + DHA was significantly more beneficial than that of MCTs or DHA alone. In conclusion, the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA could improve energy metabolism in the brain of APP/PS1 mice, thus decreasing nerve cell apoptosis and inhibiting the expression of A\u03b2.",

Numerous alternatives have been studied for inhibiting A\u03b2 aggregation but, at this time, there are no effective treatments available. Here, we developed the tri-component nanohybrid system AuNPs@POM@PEG based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) covered with polyoxometalates (POMs) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). In this work, AuNPs@POM@PEG demonstrated the inhibition of the formation of amyloid fibrils, showing a 75% decrease in A\u03b2 aggregation in vitro. As it is a potential candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of AuNPs@POM@PEG and its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We achieved a stable nanosystem that is non-cytotoxic below 2.5 nM to human neurovascular cells. The brain permeability of AuNPs@POM@PEG was analyzed in an in vitro microphysiological model of the BBB (BBB-on-a-chip), containing 3D human neurovascular cell co-cultures and microfluidics. The results show that AuNPs@POM@PEG was able to cross the brain endothelial barrier in the chip and demonstrated that POM does not affect the barrier integrity, giving the green light to further studies into this system as a nanotherapeutic.",

Extracts using food-grade solvents such as water and ethanol were prepared by maceration from dried L. spathulatum leaves. They were evaluated for in vitro inhibition activity of enzymes such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), \u03b1-glucosidase, tyrosinase and lipase, related to Alzheimer's disease, type-2-diabetes mellitus, skin hyperpigmentation, and obesity, respectively. These extracts were also appraised for in vitro acute toxicity on tumoral and non-tumoral cell lines and their chemical composition by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). The extracts were more effective towards BChE than AChE. The best results were obtained with the hydroethanolic and water extracts, with IC50 values of 0.03 mg/mL and 0.06 mg/mL, respectively. The hydroethanolic extract had the highest capacity to inhibit \u03b1-glucosidase (IC50: 0.04 mg/mL), higher than the positive control used (acarbose, IC50 = 3.14 mg/mL). The ethanol extract displayed the best inhibitory activity against tyrosinase (IC50 = 0.34 mg/mL). The tested samples did not inhibit lipase and exhibited low to moderate cytotoxic activity against the tested cell lines. The hydroethanolic extract had a higher diversity of compounds, followed by the ethanol and water samples. Similar molecules were identified in all the extracts and were mainly hydroxybenzoic acids, hydroxycinnamic acids, and flavonoids. Taken together, these results suggest that L. spathulatum should be further explored as a source of bioactive ingredients for the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries.",

        "AbstractText": "The disruption of functional connectivity is one of the early events that occurs in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. This paper reports a study on the clustering structure of functional connectivity in eight important brain networks in healthy, AD, and prodromal stage subjects. We used the threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) method to explore the connectivity from resting-state functional MR images (rs-fMRIs). We conducted the study on a total of 32 AD, 32 HC, and 31 MCI subjects. We modeled the brain as a graph-based network to study these impairments, and pairwise Pearson's correlation-based functional connectivity was used to construct the brain network. The study found that connections in the sensory motor network (SMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), salience network (SAN), default mode network (DMN), and cerebral network were severely affected in AD and MCI. The disruption in these networks may serve as potential biomarkers for distinguishing AD and MCI from HC. The study suggests that alterations in functional connectivity in these networks may contribute to cognitive deficits observed in AD and MCI. Additionally, a negative correlation was observed between the global clinical dementia rating (CDR) score and the Z-score of functional connectivity within identified clusters in AD subjects. These findings provide compelling evidence suggesting that the neurodegenerative disruption of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity is extensively distributed across multiple networks in individuals diagnosed with AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique also used as a non-pharmacological intervention against cognitive impairment. The purpose of the present review was to summarize what is currently known about the effectiveness of rTMS intervention on different cognitive domains in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to address potential neuromodulation approaches in combination with electroencephalography (EEG) and neuroimaging, especially functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this systematic review, we consulted three main databases (PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus), and Google Scholar was selected for the gray literature search. The PRISMA flowchart drove the studies' inclusion. The selection process ensured that only high-quality studies were included; after removing duplicate papers, explicit ratings were given based on the quality classification as high (A), moderate (B), or low (C), considering factors such as risks of bias, inaccuracies, inconsistencies, lack of direction, and publication bias. Seven full-text articles fulfilled the stated inclusion, reporting five double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled studies, a case study, and a randomized crossover trial. The results of the reviewed studies suggested that rTMS in MCI patients is safe and effective for enhancing cognitive functions, thus making it a potential therapeutic approach for MCI patients. Changes in functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) after targeted rTMS could represent a valuable indicator of treatment response. Finally, high-frequency rTMS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been shown to significantly enhance cognitive functions, such as executive performance, together with the increase of functional connectivity within frontoparietal networks. The main limitations were the number of included studies and the exclusion of studies using intermittent theta-burst stimulation, used in studies on Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, neuroimaging techniques in combination with rTMS have been shown to be useful for future network-based, fMRI-guided therapeutic approaches.",

        "AbstractText": "The microtubule-associated protein tau is an intrinsically disordered protein containing a few short and transient secondary structures. Tau physiologically associates with microtubules (MTs) for its stabilization and detaches from MTs to regulate its dynamics. Under pathological conditions, tau is abnormally modified, detaches from MTs, and forms protein aggregates in neuronal and glial cells. Tau protein aggregates can be found in a number of devastating neurodegenerative diseases known as \"tauopathies\", such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), etc. However, it is still unclear how the tau protein is compacted into ordered protein aggregates, and the toxicity of the aggregates is still debated. Fortunately, there has been considerable progress in the study of tau in recent years, particularly in the understanding of the intercellular transmission of pathological tau species, the structure of tau aggregates, and the conformational change events in the tau polymerization process. In this review, we summarize the concepts of tau protein aggregation and discuss the views on tau protein transmission and toxicity.",

However, clinical diagnosis remains challenging, with misdiagnoses and underdiagnoses being prevalent. There is an increased focus on putative, blood-based biomarkers that may be useful for the diagnosis as well as early detection of AD. In the present study, we used an unbiased combination of machine learning and functional network analyses to identify blood gene biomarker candidates in AD. Using supervised machine learning, we also determined whether these candidates were indeed unique to AD or whether they were indicative of other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Our analyses showed that genes involved in spliceosome assembly, RNA binding, transcription, protein synthesis, mitoribosomes, and NADH dehydrogenase were the best-performing genes for identifying AD patients relative to cognitively healthy controls. This transcriptomic signature, however, was not unique to AD, and subsequent machine learning showed that this signature could also predict PD and ALS relative to controls without neurodegenerative disease. Combined, our results suggest that mRNA from whole blood can indeed be used to screen for patients with neurodegeneration but may be less effective in diagnosing the specific neurodegenerative disease.",

        "AbstractText": "The P301L mutation in tau protein is a prevalent pathogenic mutation associated with neurodegenerative frontotemporal dementia, FTD. The mechanism by which P301L triggers or facilitates neurodegeneration at the molecular level remains unclear. In this work, we examined the effect of the P301L mutation on the biochemical and biological characteristics of pathologically relevant hyperphosphorylated tau. Hyperphosphorylated P301L tau forms cytotoxic aggregates more efficiently than hyperphosphorylated wildtype tau or unphosphorylated P301L tau in vitro. Mechanistic studies establish that hyperphosphorylated P301L tau exacerbates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated gene upregulation in a neuroblastoma cell line when compared to wildtype hyperphosphorylated tau treatment. Furthermore, the microtubule cytoskeleton is severely disrupted following hyperphosphorylated P301L tau treatment. A hyperphosphorylated tau aggregation inhibitor, apomorphine, also inhibits the harmful effects caused by P301L hyperphosphorylated tau. In short, the P301L single mutation within the core repeat domain of tau renders the underlying hyperphosphorylated tau more potent in eliciting ER stress and cytoskeleton damage. However, the P301L mutation alone, without hyperphosphorylation, is not sufficient to cause these phenotypes. Understanding the conditions and mechanisms whereby selective mutations aggravate the pathogenic activities of tau can provide pivotal clues on novel strategies for drug development for frontotemporal dementia and other related neurodegenerative tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease.",

However, overexposure to Mn is toxic, particularly to the central nervous system (CNS) due to it causing the progressive destruction of nerve cells. Exposure to manganese is widespread and occurs by inhalation, ingestion, or dermal contact. Associations have been observed between Mn accumulation and neurodegenerative diseases such as manganism, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. People with genetic diseases associated with a mutation in the gene associated with impaired Mn excretion, kidney disease, iron deficiency, or a vegetarian diet are at particular risk of excessive exposure to Mn. This review has collected data on the current knowledge of the source of Mn exposure, the experimental data supporting the dispersive accumulation of Mn in the brain, the controversies surrounding the reference values of biomarkers related to Mn status in different matrices, and the competitiveness of Mn with other metals, such as iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), calcium (Ca). The disturbed homeostasis of Mn in the body has been connected with susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases, fertility, and infectious diseases.

Although the cause of this condition has been identified long ago as aberrant aggregations of amyloid and tau proteins, effective therapies for it remain elusive. The complexities of drug development for AD treatment are often compounded by the impermeable blood-brain barrier and low-yield brain delivery. In addition, the use of high drug concentrations to overcome this challenge may entail side effects. To address these challenges and enhance the precision of delivery into brain regions affected by amyloid aggregation, we proposed a transferrin-conjugated nanoparticle-based drug delivery system. The transferrin-conjugated melittin-loaded L-arginine-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (Tf-MeLioNs) developed in this study successfully mitigated melittin-induced cytotoxicity and hemolysis in the cell culture system. In the 5XFAD mouse brain, Tf-MeLioNs remarkably reduced amyloid plaque accumulation, particularly in the hippocampus. This study suggested Tf-LioNs as a potential drug delivery platform and Tf-MeLioNs as a candidate for therapeutic drug targeting of amyloid plaques in AD.

This study used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to examine the levels of metals in the blood plasma, frontal cortex, and hippocampus of Wistar rats with AD induced by streptozotocin (STZ). It also tested the effects of the antioxidant hydroxytyrosol (HT) on metal levels.

The results also indicated that the control group and the STZ + HT group exhibited enhanced learning curves during the Barnes maze training as compared to the STZ group. The ICP-MS analysis showed that the STZ group had lower levels of cobalt in their blood plasma than the control group, while the calcium levels in the frontal cortex of the STZ + HT group were higher than in the control group. The most important finding was that copper levels in the frontal cortex from STZ-treated animals were higher than in the control group, and that the STZ + HT group returned to equivalent levels to the control group. The antioxidant HT can restore copper levels to their basal physiological state. This finding may help explain HT's potential beneficial effect in AD-patients.",

AD symptoms include progressive memory loss associated with amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and dismantled synaptic mechanisms. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are important components of the extracellular matrix with a critical role in synaptic stabilisation and have been shown to be influenced by microglia, which enter an activated state during AD. This study aimed to investigate whether sex differences affected the density of PNNs alongside the labelling of microglia and A\u03b2 plaques density.We performed neurochemistry experiments using acute brain slices from both sexes of the APPNL-F/NL-F mouse model of AD, aged-matched (2-5 and 12-16 months) to wild-type mice, combined with a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and hippocampal CA1, which are vulnerable during early AD pathology, were investigated and compared to the presubiculum (PRS), a region unscathed by AD pathology. The highest density of PNNs was found in the LEC and PRS regions of aged APPNL-F/NL-F mice with a region-specific sex differences. Analysis of the CA1 region using multiplex-fluorescent images from aged APPNL-F/NL-F mice showed regions of dense A\u03b2 plaques near clusters of CD68, indicative of activated microglia and PNNs. This was consistent with the results of WGCNA performed on normalised data on microglial cells isolated from age-matched, late-stage male and female wild-type and APP knock-in mice, which revealed one microglial module that showed differential expression associated with tissue, age, genotype, and sex, which showed enrichment for fc-receptor-mediated phagocytosis.

Here, we revealed a decreased expression of a number of the Ly6/uPAR proteins targeting nAChRs in the cerebellum of 2xTg-AD mice (model of early AD) in comparison with non-transgenic mice both at mRNA and protein levels.

Based on these data together with observed astrocyte degeneration in the cerebellum of 2xTg-AD mice, we suggest the mechanism by which expression of the Ly6/uPAR proteins upon A\u03b2 pathology results in dysregulation of the cholinergic system and particularly of \u03b17-nAChR function in the cerebellum.

To date, attempts have been made to overcome cognitive dysfunction and understand and delay the aging processes that lead to degenerative and chronic diseases. Cognitive dysfunction is involved in aging and the disruption of inflammation and innate immunity. Recent reports have indicated that the innate immune system is prevalent in patients with AD, and that peripheral neutrophil markers can predict a decline in executive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Furthermore, altered levels of pro-inflammatory interleukins have been reported in MCI, which have been suggested to play a role in the peripheral immune system during the process from early MCI to dementia. Neutrophils are the first responders of the innate immune system. Neutrophils eliminate harmful cellular debris via phagocytosis, secrete inflammatory factors to activate host defense systems, stimulate cytokine production, kill pathogens, and regulate extracellular proteases and inhibitors.

        "AbstractText": "The polygenic risk score (PRS), together with the \u025b4 allele of the APOE gene (APOE-\u025b4), has shown high potential for Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk prediction. The aim of this study was to validate the model of polygenic risk in Russian patients with dementia. A microarray-based assay was developed to identify 21 markers of polygenic risk and \u025b alleles of the APOE gene. This case-control study included 348 dementia patients and 519 cognitively normal volunteers. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau protein levels were assessed in 57 dementia patients. PRS and APOE-\u025b4 were significant genetic risk factors for dementia. Adjusted for APOE-\u025b4, individuals with PRS corresponding to the fourth quartile had an increased risk of dementia compared to the first quartile (OR 1.85; p-value 0.002). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.559 for the PRS model only, and the inclusion of APOE-\u025b4 improved the AUC to 0.604. PRS was positively correlated with tTau and pTau181 and inversely correlated with A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio. Carriers of APOE-\u025b4 had higher levels of tTau and pTau181 and lower levels of A\u03b242 and A\u03b242/A\u03b240. The developed assay can be part of a strategy for assessing individuals for AD risk, with the purpose of assisting primary preventive interventions.",

The aim of the present study was to isolate total EVs from plasma and characterize their microRNA (miRNA) contents in AD patients. We isolated total EVs from the plasma of all recruited subjects using ExoQuickULTRA exosome precipitation solution (SBI). Subsequently, circulating total EVs were characterized using Nanosight nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Western blotting. A panel of 754 miRNAs was determined with RT-qPCR using TaqMan OpenArray technology in a QuantStudio 12K System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The results demonstrated that plasma EVs showed widespread deregulation of specific miRNAs (miR-106a-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-19b-3p, miR-20a-5p, miR-223-3p, miR-25-3p, miR-296-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-532-3p, miR-92a-3p, and miR-451a), some of which were already known to be associated with neurological pathologies. A further validation analysis also confirmed a significant upregulation of miR-16-5p, miR-25-3p, miR-92a-3p, and miR-451a in prodromal AD patients, suggesting these dysregulated miRNAs are involved in the early progression of AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common cause of dementia characterized by neurodegenerative dysregulations, cognitive impairments, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Physical exercise (PE) has emerged as a powerful tool for reducing chronic inflammation, improving overall health, and preventing cognitive decline. The connection between the immune system, gut microbiota (GM), and neuroinflammation highlights the role of the gut-brain axis in maintaining brain health and preventing neurodegenerative diseases. Neglected so far, PE has beneficial effects on microbial composition and diversity, thus providing the potential to alleviate neurological symptoms. There is bidirectional communication between the gut and muscle, with GM diversity modulation and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production affecting muscle metabolism and preservation, and muscle activity/exercise in turn inducing significant changes in GM composition, functionality, diversity, and SCFA production. This gut-muscle and muscle-gut interplay can then modulate cognition. For instance, irisin, an exercise-induced myokine, promotes neuroplasticity and cognitive function through BDNF signaling. Irisin and muscle-generated BDNF may mediate the positive effects of physical activity against some aspects of AD pathophysiology through the interaction of exercise with the gut microbial ecosystem, neural plasticity, anti-inflammatory signaling pathways, and neurogenesis. Understanding gut-muscle-brain interconnections hold promise for developing strategies to promote brain health, fight age-associated cognitive decline, and improve muscle health and longevity.",

The systematic review presented herein focuses on the analysis of the functions of various adipokines in the pathogenesis of CNS diseases. Thirteen proteins were selected for analysis through scientific databases. It was found that these proteins can be identified within the cerebrospinal fluid either by their ability to modify their molecular complex and cross the blood-brain barrier or by being endogenously produced within the CNS itself. As a result, this can correlate with their measurability during pathological processes, including Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, depression, or brain tumors.",

        "AbstractText": "Adequate perfusion of cerebral tissues, which is necessary for the preservation of optimal brain health, depends on insulin signaling within brain endothelial cells. Proper insulin signaling relies on the regulated internalization of insulin bound to the insulin receptor, a process which is disrupted by hyperinsulinemia via an unknown mechanism. Thus, the goal of this study was to characterize the impact of hyperinsulinemia on the regulation of molecular targets involved in cerebral blood flow and insulin receptor internalization into brain endothelial cells. The phosphorylation of molecular targets associated with cerebral blood flow and insulin receptor internalization was assessed in hyperinsulinemic brain endothelial cells. Insulin receptor uptake into cells was also examined in the setting of endocytosis blockade. Our data demonstrate that hyperinsulinemia impairs the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase. These data correspond with an impairment in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the insulin receptor and dysregulated phosphorylation of key internalization effectors. We conclude that hyperinsulinemia alters the phosphorylation of molecular targets involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, disrupts signaling through the insulin receptor, and hinders the capacity for blood flow regulation by brain endothelial cells.",

However, the physiological functions of APP are still largely unexplored. APP is a transmembrane glycoprotein whose expression in humans is abundant in the central nervous system. Specifically, several studies have revealed the high expression of APP during brain development. Previous studies in our laboratory revealed that a transient increase in APP expression induces early cell cycle exit of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) and directs their differentiation towards glial cells (gliogenesis) while decreasing their differentiation towards neurons (neurogenesis). In the present study, we have evaluated the intrinsic cellular effects of APP down-expression (using siRNA) on cell death, cell proliferation, and cell fate specification of hNSCs. Our data indicate that APP silencing causes cellular effects opposite to those obtained in previous APP overexpression assays, inducing cell proliferation in hNS1 cells (a model line of hNSCs) and favoring neurogenesis instead of gliogenesis in these cells. In addition, we have analyzed the gene and protein expression levels of \u03b2-Catenin as a possible molecule involved in these cellular effects. These data could help to understand the biological role of APP, which is necessary to deepen the knowledge of AD.",

However, as reviewed in this article, results from the numerous clinical trials that have tested anti-A\u03b2 therapies to date indicate that this peptide plays a minor role in the pathogenesis of AD. Indeed, even Aducanumab and Lecanemab, the two antibodies recently approved by the FDA for AD therapy, as well as Donanemab showed limited efficacy on cognitive parameters in phase III clinical trials, despite their capability of markedly lowering A\u03b2 brain load. Furthermore, preclinical evidence demonstrates that A\u03b2 possesses several physiological functions, including memory formation, suggesting that AD may in part be due to a loss of function of this peptide. Finally, it is generally accepted that AD could be the result of many molecular dysfunctions, and therefore, if we keep chasing only A\u03b2, it means that we cannot see the forest for the trees.",

The in vitro rat sciatic nerve model is employed and the nerve action potential (NAP) is quantified with different stimuli while exposed to different concentrations of A\u03b242. A\u03b242 predominantly reduces the NAP amplitude with minimal effects on other parameters except at low stimulus currents and short inter-stimulus intervals. The effects of A\u03b242 are significantly concentration-dependent, with a maximum reduction in NAP amplitude at a concentration of 70 nM and smaller effects on the NAP amplitude at higher and lower concentrations. However, even physiologic concentrations in the range of 70 pM did reduce the NAP amplitude. The effects of A\u03b242 became maximal 5-8 h after exposure and did not reverse during a 30 min washout period. The in vitro rat sciatic nerve model is sensitive to the effects of physiologic concentrations of A\u03b242. These experiments suggest that the effect of A\u03b242 is a very complex function of concentration that may be the result of amyloid-related changes in membrane properties or sodium channels.",

With microglia's important involvement in the pathology and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), understanding whether systemically administered drugs intended for other affections could impact microglia function, already impacted by the presence of beta-amyloid, is important. The aim of this study was to evaluate morphological changes of microglia, using in vivo 2-photon laser scanning microscopy, in a murine model of AD under systemic administration of sodium or calcium ion channel blockers in order to establish potential effects that these drugs might have on microglia under neuro-inflammatory conditions. A total of 30 mice (age 14-16 weeks, weight 20-25 g) were used, with 25 APP randomly divided into three groups. The remaining animals were CX3CR1GFP/GFP male mice (n = 5) used as WT controls. After baseline behavior testing, all animals received daily intraperitoneal injections for 30 days according to the assigned group [WT (n = 5), Control (n = 5), Carbamazepine (n = 10), and Verapamil (n = 10)]. The results showed that the Verapamil treatment improved short-term memory and enhanced exploratory behavior in APP mice. The Carbamazepine treatment also improved short-term memory but did not elicit significant changes in anxiety-related behavior. Both Verapamil and Carbamazepine reduced the surveillance speed of microglia processes and changed microglia morphology in the cortex compared to the Control group. Due to their complex molecular machinery, microglia are potentially affected by drugs that do not target them specifically, and, as such, investigating these interactions could prove beneficial in our management of neurodegenerative pathologies.",

It is important to note that drugs used to treat Alzheimer's disease, in particular acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, show a positive therapeutic potential in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, while drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes can also prevent a number of pathologies characteristic for Alzheimer's disease.

Here, we provide an alternative view based on 2 machine learning approaches which we compare with known simulation models. The first approach applies an autoregressive model constrained by structural connectivity, while the second is based on graph convolutional networks.

We also evaluate its real-world effectiveness and suitability by providing a web service for physicians and researchers. In experiments, the autoregressive model generally outperformed state-of-the-art models resulting in lower prediction errors.

The literature supports that soluble A\u03b2o are implicated in synapse and neuronal losses in the brain regions such as the hippocampus. This region importantly contributes to explicit memory, the first type of memory affected in AD. During AD preclinical and prodromal stages, people are also experiencing wake/sleep alterations such as insomnia (e.g., difficulty initiating sleep, decreased sleep duration), excessive daytime sleepiness, and sleep schedule modifications. In addition, changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during wake and sleep have been reported in AD patients and animal models. However, the specific contribution of A\u03b2o to wake/sleep alterations is poorly understood and was investigated in the present study. Chronic hippocampal injections of soluble A\u03b2o were conducted in male rats and combined with EEG recording to determine the progressive impact of A\u03b2 pathology specifically on wake/sleep architecture and EEG activity. Bilateral injections were conducted for 6 consecutive days, and EEG acquisition was done before, during, and after A\u03b2o injections. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess neuron numbers in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). A\u03b2o injections did not affect the time spent in wakefulness, slow wave sleep (SWS), and paradoxical sleep but altered EEG activity during wake and SWS. More precisely, A\u03b2o increased slow-wave activity (SWA; 0.5-5\u00a0Hz) and low-beta activity (16-20\u00a0Hz) during wake and decreased theta (5-9\u00a0Hz) and alpha (9-12\u00a0Hz) activities during SWS. Moreover, the theta activity/SWA ratio during wake and SWS was decreased by A\u03b2o. These effects were significant only after 6\u00a0days of A\u03b2o injections and were found with alterations in neuron counts in the DG. We found multiple modifications of the wake and SWS EEG following A\u03b2o delivery to the hippocampus. These findings expose a specific EEG signature of A\u03b2 pathology and can serve the development of non-invasive and cost-effective markers for the early diagnosis of AD or other amyloid-related diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "Age-associated deterioration of the immune system contributes to a chronic low-grade inflammatory state known as \"inflammaging\" and is implicated in the pathogenesis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Whether changes in the tissue environment caused by circulatory factors associated with aging may alter the innate immune response is unknown. Monocyte-derived macrophages (Mo-M\u0424s) infiltrating the brain alongside microglia are postulated to play a modulatory role in LOAD and both express triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2). Apolipoprotein E (APOE) acts as a ligand for TREM2, and their role in amyloid beta (A\u03b2) clearance highlights their importance in LOAD. However, the influence of the patient's own milieu (autologous serum) on the synthesis of TREM2 and APOE in infiltrating macrophages remains unknown. To functionally assess patient-specific TREM2 and APOE synthesis, we designed a personalized assay based on Mo-M\u0424s using monocytes from LOAD patients and matched controls (CO). We assessed the influence of each participant's own milieu, by examining the effect of short- (1\u00a0day) and long- (10\u00a0days) term differentiation of the cells in the presence of the donor\u00b4s autologous serum (AS) into M1-, M2- or M0-macrophages. Additionally, sex differences and A\u03b2-uptake ability in short- and long-term differentiated Mo-M\u0424s were assessed. We showed a time-dependent increase in TREM2 and APOE protein levels in LOAD- and CO-derived cells. While AS did not differentially modulate TREM2 compared to standard fetal calf serum (FCS), AS decreased APOE levels in M2 macrophages but increased levels in M1 macrophages. Interestingly, higher levels of TREM2 and lower levels of APOE were detected in female- than in male- LOAD patients. Finally, we report decreased A\u03b2-uptake in long-term differentiated CO- and LOAD-derived cells, particularly in APOE\u03b54(+) carriers. We demonstrate for the first time the suitability of a personalized Mo-M\u0424 cell culture-based assay for studying functional TREM2 and APOE synthesis in a patient's own aged milieu.

The basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN) provide the primary source of cholinergic innervation of the human cerebral cortex and may be\u00a0differentially vulnerable in various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the impact of chronic neuroinflammation on the cholinergic function is still unclear. To gain further insight into age-related cholinergic decline, we investigated the cumulative effects of aging and chronic neuroinflammation on the structure and function of the septal cholinergic neurons in transgenic mice expressing interleukin-6 under the GFAP promoter (GFAP-IL6), which maintains a constant level of gliosis. Immunohistochemistry combined with unbiased stereology, single cell 3D morphology analysis and in vitro whole cell patch-clamp measurements were used to validate the structural and functional changes of BFCN and their microglial environment in the medial septum. Stereological estimation of MS microglia number displayed significant increase across all three age groups, while a significant decrease in cholinergic cell number in the adult and aged groups in GFAP-IL6 mice compared to control. Moreover, we observed age-dependent alterations in the electrophysiological properties of cholinergic neurons and an increased excitability profile in the adult GFAP-IL6 group due to chronic neuroinflammation. These results complimented the significant decrease in hippocampal pyramidal spine density seen with aging and neuroinflammation. We provide evidence of the significant impact of both aging and chronic glial activation on the cholinergic and microglial numbers and morphology in the MS, and alterations in the passive and active electrophysiological membrane properties of septal cholinergic neurons, resulting in cholinergic dysfunction, as seen in AD.

In this review, we discuss the phenotypic presentation and use of biomarkers for the early diagnosis of typical and atypical AD and describe how this can support clinical decision making, benefit patient communication, and improve the patient journey. Early diagnosis is essential to optimize the benefits of available and emerging treatments. As atypical presentations of AD often mimic other dementias, differential diagnosis can be challenging and can be facilitated using AD biomarkers. However, AD biomarkers alone are not sufficient to confidently diagnose AD or predict disease progression and should be supplementary to clinical assessment to help inform the diagnosis of AD. Use of AD biomarkers with incorporation of atypical AD phenotypes into diagnostic criteria will allow earlier diagnosis of patients with atypical clinical presentations that otherwise would have been misdiagnosed and treated inappropriately. Early diagnosis is essential to guide informed discussion, appropriate care and support, and individualized treatment.

The amnestic mild cognitive impairment vs non-amnestic mild cognitive impairments classifier believes that 71.8% of Alzheimer's disease are amnestic mild cognitive impairment. And 73.5% of subjective cognitive declines are labeled as mild cognitive impairments, 88.8% of which are further suggested as \"amnestic mild cognitive impairment.\" Further multimodal analyses suggest that the amnestic mild cognitive impairment-like Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment-like subjective cognitive decline, and amnestic mild cognitive impairment-like subjective cognitive decline exhibit more Alzheimer's disease -related pathological changes (elaborated \u03b2-amyloid depositions, reduced glucose metabolism, and gray matter atrophy) than non-amnestic mild cognitive impairments -like Alzheimer's disease, healthy control-like subjective cognitive decline, and non-amnestic mild cognitive impairments -like subjective cognitive decline.

Current biomarkers for AD diagnosis require expensive neuroimaging or invasive cerebrospinal fluid sampling, thus precluding early detection. Blood-based biomarker discovery in Alzheimer's can facilitate less-invasive, routine diagnostic tests to aid early intervention. Therefore, we propose \"c-Diadem\" (constrained dual-input Alzheimer's disease model), a novel deep learning classifier which incorporates KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway constraints on the input genotyping data to predict disease, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/AD or cognitively normal (CN). SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to explain the model and identify novel, potential blood-based genetic markers of MCI/AD. We developed a novel constrained deep learning neural network which utilizes SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and microarray data from ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) to predict the disease status of participants, i.e., CN or with disease (MCI/AD), and identify potential blood-based biomarkers for diagnosis and intervention. The dataset contains samples from 626 participants, of which 212 are CN (average age 74.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.4\u00a0years) and 414 patients have MCI/AD (average age 72.7\u2009\u00b1\u20097.6\u00a0years). KEGG pathway information was used to generate constraints applied to the input tensors, thus enhancing the interpretability of the model. SHAP scores were used to identify genes which could potentially serve as biomarkers for diagnosis and targets for drug development. Our model's performance, with accuracy of 69% and AUC of 70% in the test dataset, is superior to previous models. The SHAP scores show that SNPs in PRKCZ, PLCB1 and ITPR2 as well as expression of HLA-DQB1, EIF1AY, HLA-DQA1, and ZFP57 have more impact on model predictions. In addition to predicting MCI/AD, our model has been interrogated for potential genetic biomarkers using SHAP. From our analysis, we have identified blood-based genetic markers related to Ca2+ ion release in affected regions of the brain, as well as depression. The findings from our study provides insights into disease mechanisms, and can facilitate innovation in less-invasive, cost-effective diagnostics. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first to use pathway constraints in a multimodal neural network to identify potential genetic markers for AD.",

        "AbstractText": "The hippocampus is a key area of the brain responsible for learning, memory, and other abilities. Accurately segmenting the hippocampus and precisely calculating the volume of the hippocampus is of great significance for predicting Alzheimer's disease and amnesia. Most of the segmentation algorithms currently involved are based on templates, such as the more popular FreeSufer. This study proposes Deephipp, a deep learning network based on a 3D dense block using an attention mechanism for accurate segmentation of the hippocampus. DeepHipp is based on the following novelties: (i) DeepHipp adopts powerful data augmentation schemes to enhance the segmentation ability. (ii) DeepHipp is designed to incorporate 3D dense-block to capture multiple-scale features of the hippocampus. (iii) DeepHipp creatively uses the attention mechanism in the field of hippocampal image segmentation, extracting useful hippocampus information in a massive feature map, and improving the accuracy and sensitivity of the model. We describe the illustrative results and show extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons with other methods. Our achievement demonstrates that the accuracy of DeepHipp can reach 83.63%, which is superior to most existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency of hippocampus segmentation. It is noticeable that deep learning can potentially lead to an effective segmentation of medical images.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease, the development of which is associated with the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid oligomers, dysfunction of the \u03b17-nAChR nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and activation of inflammation. Previously, we showed that the neuromodulator Lynx1, which belongs to the Ly6/uPAR family, competes with \u03b2-amyloid(1-42) for binding to \u03b17-nAChR. In this work, we studied the expression and localization of Ly6/uPAR family proteins in the hippocampus of 2xTg-AD transgenic mice that model AD and demonstrate increased amyloidosis in the brain. Using real-time PCR, we showed a decrease in the expression of the genes encoding Lynx1, Lypd6b, and the postsynaptic marker PSD95, as well as an increase in the expression of the TNF\u03b1 gene in the hippocampus of 2xTg-AD mice. Histochemical analysis showed that, in the hippocampus of 2xTg-AD mice, Lynx1 does not colocalize with \u03b17-nAChR, which can lead to the development of pathology when the receptor interacts with oligomeric \u03b2-amyloid. In addition, in 2xTg-AD mice, activation of systemic inflammation was shown, which manifests itself in a decrease in the serum level of SLURP-1, a Ly6/uPAR family protein capable of regulating inflammatory processes, as well as in an increase in the content of proinflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and TNF\u03b2. Thus, \u03b17-nAChR dysfunction and maintenance of the inflammatory microenvironment in the brain in Alzheimer's disease may be associated with a decrease in the expression of Ly6/uPAR family proteins that regulate \u03b17-nAChR activity and inflammation.",

        "AbstractText": "Bridging the gap between preclinical models of neurological and psychiatric disorders with their human manifestations is necessary to understand their underlying mechanisms, identify biomarkers, and develop novel therapeutics. Cognitive and social impairments underlie multiple neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders and are often comorbid with sleep disturbances, which can exacerbate poor outcomes. Importantly, many symptoms are conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates, although they may have subtle differences. Therefore, it is essential to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying these behaviors across different species and their translatability to humans. Genome-wide association studies have indicated an association between glutamatergic gene variants and both the risk and frequency of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. For example, changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission, such as glutamate receptor subtype N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction, have been shown to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Furthermore, in neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease, hyperactivation of NMDARs leads to synaptic damage. In addition to glutamate binding, NMDARs require the binding of a co-agonist D-serine or glycine to the GluN1 subunit to open. D-serine, which is racemized from L-serine by the neuronal enzyme serine racemase (SRR), and both SRR and D-serine are enriched in cortico-limbic brain regions. D-serine is critical for complex behaviors, such as cognition and social behavior, where dysregulation of its synthesis and release has been implicated in many pathological conditions. In this review, we explore the role of D-serine in behaviors that are translationally relevant to multiple psychiatric and neurological disorders in different models across species.",

The aim of this study was to develop and interpret a ML algorithm capable of differentiating Alzheimer's dementia, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies and cognitively normal control subjects based on sociodemographic, clinical, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) variables. 506 subjects from 5 databases were included. MRI images were processed with FreeSurfer, LPA, and TRACULA to obtain brain volumes and thicknesses, white matter lesions and diffusion metrics. MRI metrics were used in conjunction with clinical and demographic data to perform differential diagnosis based on a Support Vector Machine model called MUQUBIA (Multimodal Quantification of Brain whIte matter biomArkers). Age, gender, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Dementia Staging Instrument, and 19 imaging features formed the best set of discriminative features. The predictive model performed with an overall Area Under the Curve of 98%, high overall precision (88%), recall (88%), and F1 scores (88%) in the test group, and good Label Ranking Average Precision score (0.95) in a subset of neuropathologically assessed patients. The results of MUQUBIA were explained by the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method.

Advanced immunoassays show significant elevations in plasma total tau (t-tau) early post-TBI, but concentrations subsequently normalise rapidly. Tau phosphorylated at serine-181 (p-tau181) is a well-validated Alzheimer's disease marker that could potentially seed progressive neurodegeneration. We tested whether post-traumatic p-tau181 concentrations are elevated and relate to progressive brain atrophy. Plasma p-tau181 and other post-traumatic biomarkers, including total-tau (t-tau), neurofilament light (NfL), ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), were assessed after moderate-to-severe TBI in the BIO-AX-TBI cohort (first sample mean 2.7 days, second sample within 10 days, then 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months, n=42). Brain atrophy rates were assessed in aligned serial MRI (n=40). Concentrations were compared patients with and without Alzheimer's disease, with healthy controls. Plasma p-tau181 concentrations were significantly raised in patients with Alzheimer's disease but not after TBI, where concentrations were non-elevated, and remained stable over one year. P-tau181 after TBI was not predictive of brain atrophy rates in either grey or white matter. In contrast, substantial trauma-associated elevations in t-tau, NfL, GFAP and UCH-L1 were seen, with concentrations of NfL and t-tau predictive of brain atrophy rates. Plasma p-tau181 is not significantly elevated during the first year after moderate-to-severe TBI and levels do not relate to neuroimaging measures of neurodegeneration.",

However, amyloid beta peptide or p-tau in spinal cord following injury is not well known. In this investigation we measured amyloid beta peptide and p-tau together with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in spinal cord and brain following 48\u00a0h after spinal cord injury in relation to the blood-spinal cord and blood-brain barrier, edema formation, blood flow changes and cell injury in perifocal regions of the spinal cord and brain areas. A focal spinal cord injury was inflicted over the right dorsal horn of the T10-11 segment (4\u00a0mm long and 2\u00a0mm deep) and amyloid beta peptide and p-tau was measured in perifocal rostral (T9) and caudal (T12) spinal cord segments as well as in the brain areas. Our observations showed a significant increase in amyloid beta peptide in the T9 and T12 segments as well as in remote areas of brain and spinal cord after 24 and 48\u00a0h injury. This is associated with breakdown of the blood-spinal cord (BSCB) and brain barriers (BBB), edema formation, reduction in blood flow and cell injury. After 48\u00a0h of spinal cord injury elevation of amyloid beta peptide, phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) was seen in T9 and T12 segments of spinal cord in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and brain stem regions associated with microglial activation as seen by upregulation of Iba1 and CD86.

        "AbstractText": "Nicotine abuse is frequent worldwide leading to about 8 millions people die every year due to tobacco related diseases. Military personnel often use nicotine smoking that is about 12.8% higher than civilian populations. Nicotine smoking triggers oxidative stress and are linked to several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Nicotine neurotoxicity induces significant depression and oxidative stress in the brain leading to neurovascular damages and brain pathology. Thus, details of nicotine neurotoxicity and factors influencing them require additional investigations. In this review, effects of engineered nanoparticles from metals Ag and Cu (50-60\u00a0nm) on nicotine neurotoxicity are discussed with regard to nicotine smoking. Military personnel often work in the environment where chances of nanoparticles exposure are quite common. In our earlier studies, we have shown that nanoparticles alone induces breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and exacerbates brain pathology in animal models. In present investigation, nicotine exposure in with Ag or Cu nanoparticles intoxicated group exacerbated BBB breakdown, induce oxidative stress and aggravate brain pathology. Treatment with nanowired H-290/51 a potent chain-breaking antioxidant together with nanowired ondansetron, a potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonist significantly reduced oxidative stress, BBB breakdown and brain pathology in nicotine exposure associated with Ag or Cu nanoparticles intoxication.

Military personnel during combat operation or veterans are often the victims of brain injury that is a major risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease in their later lives.

Medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) plays a vital role in memory function and is affected early in AD. Growing evidence indicates benefits of regular exercise on memory and cognitive function in humans with AD, although, the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Therefore, this study was designed to test the effects of 16\u00a0weeks treadmill exercise on spatial learning memory and the underlying cellular mechanisms in 6-month-old 3xTg-AD mice. Whole-cell patch clamp was used to examine neuronal intrinsic excitability, spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) and spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) of mEC layer II/III pyramidal neurons in the following groups: wild type (WT\u00a0+\u00a0sham), 3xTg-AD (AD+sham), WT receiving exercise (WT\u00a0+\u00a0Ex), and AD receiving exercise (AD+Ex). We found that at a behavioral level, treadmill exercise decreased working memory errors in radial arm maze (RAM) test in 6-month-old AD mice. At a cellular level, we found that treadmill exercise prevented the abnormal increase in mEC pyramidal neuron input resistance and action potential firing in 6-month-old 3xTg-AD mice compared with WT\u00a0+\u00a0sham and AD+Ex mice; further, sEPSC amplitude and frequency were normal in AD+Ex but overactive in AD+sham; additionally, GABAergic inhibition was normal in AD+Ex mice but reduced in AD+sham. In conclusion, our results indicate that treadmill exercise improves spatial learning memory and prevents network hyperexcitability in mEC by reducing pyramidal neuronal intrinsic excitability and normalizing excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in 3xTg-AD mice.",

Nevertheless, its instability and limited water solubility lead to diminished medicinal efficacy. In this study, we utilized PMBN (poly [MPC-co-(BMA)-co-(MEONP)]) as a nanocarrier for targeted brain drug delivery of frankincense, employing lactoferrin as a ligand for precise targeting. Characterization of nanoparticle properties was conducted through FTIR and FESEM analysis, and the in-vitro drug release percentage from the nanoparticles was quantified. To induce Alzheimer's-like dementia in rats, scopolamine was intraperitoneally administered at a dose of 1\u00a0mg/kg/day for 14\u00a0days. Subsequently, behavioral assessments (Y-maze, passive avoidance test, tail suspension test) were performed, followed by evaluations of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), and brain histopathology at the conclusion of the treatment period. The results revealed that the nanoparticles had a size of 106.6\u00a0nm and a zeta potential of -3.8\u00a0mV. The maximum release of frankincense in the PBS environment from PMBN nanoparticles was 18.2\u00a0%, in accordance with the Peppas model. Behavioral tests indicated that targeted drug nanoparticles (F-PMBN-Lf) exhibited the capability to alleviate stress and depression while enhancing short-term memory in scopolamine-induced animals. Additionally, F-PMBN-Lf counteracted the scopolamine-induced elevation of AChE activity and GSH levels. However, it resulted in decreased activity of the antioxidant enzyme CAT compared to the scopolamine group. Histological analysis of brain tissue suggested that F-PMBN-Lf exerted a notable neuroprotective effect, preserving neuronal cells in contrast to the scopolamine-induced group. It appears that the polymer nanoparticles containing this plant extract have introduced a novel neuroprotective approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

After excluding patients with disease related to oculomotor dysfunction preceding the OMCN diagnosis (e.g., dysthyroid exophthalmos, thyrotoxicosis, or myasthenia gravis), a total of 52,076 OMCN cases were established. Of these, 23,642 patients who had participated in the National Health Screening Program (NHSP) within two years before their OMCN diagnosis were included. After applying the exclusion criteria (e.g., age < 40 years, previous dementia, and patients with missing data), the final cohort consisted of 19,243 patients and 96,215 age- and sex-matched controls without OMCN. We identified newly diagnosed OMCN in the KNHIS database and collected participant characteristics from the health checkup records of the NHSP. The study endpoint was determined by the first claim with a dementia diagnostic code and anti-dementia medications. OMCN's association with dementia risk was examined using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, adjusting for age, sex, behavioral factors, and systemic comorbidities. The main outcome measures were hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause dementia (ACD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD) development in OMCN patients relative to those without OMCN. Newly diagnosed OMCN patients demonstrated higher metabolic comorbidities than non-OMCN individuals.

This study's objective was to solidify current knowledge of the clinical presentations and management of OS through a systematic review of the literature and description of two new cases. We conducted a literature search from the start of relevant databases through August 2023 to identify English language case reports of adults (\u226518 years) with OS that described clinical evaluations, biological treatments, and outcomes. We extracted demographics, proposed etiologies, treatment choices and responses, duration of delusions, comorbid psychiatric symptoms, neuro-radiographic findings, and presence of physical violence. We reported clinical findings for two new cases. Following PRISMA guidelines, we screened 705 abstracts and conducted full-text reviews of 118 articles to identify 73 cases published from 1983-2023 meeting inclusion criteria. Mean age was 58.2 years with male predominance (M:F= 1.88). Etiologies included primary psychiatric disorders (16, 22%), other medical conditions (38, 52%), and medications or other substances (19, 26%). Delusional disorder, cerebrovascular accident, and dopaminergic agonists were the most common etiologies, respectively, in these groups. Antipsychotics were the most common treatment (57, 78%). Symptom remission was reported in 51 (70%) cases. The average duration of OS was 39.5 months.

They are particularly known to affect the amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) cleavage and accumulation, tau protein homeostasis, and expression of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), Parkin, PINK1, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. These include miR-16, miR-17-5p, miR-20a, miR-106a, miR-106b, miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-103, miR-107, miR-298, miR-328, miR-195, miR-485, and miR-29. In CNS tumors, several miRNAs, including miR-31, miR-16, and miR-21 have been identified to modulate tumorigenesis through impacting tumor invasion and apoptosis. In this review article, we have a look at the recent advances on our knowledge about the role of miRNAs in human brain development and functions, neurodegenerative diseases, and their clinical potentials.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, characterized by memory loss and multiple cognitive impairments. Genetic mutations cause a small proportion (1-2%) of early-onset AD, with mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2). Major contributing factors of late-onset AD are ApoE4 genotype, traumatic brain injury, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular conditions, in addition to lifestyle factors, such as unhealthy diet and lack of physical exercise. Disease progression can be delayed and/or prevented to a greater extent by adopting healthy lifestyle with balanced and antioxidant enriched diet and daily exercise. The interaction and interplay of diet, exercise, age, and pharmacological interventions holds a crucial role in the progression, pathogenesis and management of AD and its comorbidities, including diabetes, obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular conditions. Antioxidant enriched diet contributes to brain health, glucose control, weight management, and cardiovascular well-being. Regular exercise removes toxins including free radicals and enhances insulin sensitivity, and supports cardiovascular function. In the current article, we discussed, the role of diet, and exercise in aging, AD and other conditions including diabetes, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular conditions. This article also highlights the impact of medication, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, and pharmacological interventions. These aspects were discussed in different races and ethnic groups in Texas, and the US.",

        "AbstractText": "Multimodal images such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) could provide complementary information about the brain and have been widely investigated for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, multimodal brain images are often incomplete in clinical practice. It is still challenging to make use of multimodality for disease diagnosis with missing data. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework with the multi-level guided generative adversarial network (MLG-GAN) and multimodal transformer (Mul-T) for incomplete image generation and disease classification, respectively. First, MLG-GAN is proposed to generate the missing data, guided by multi-level information from voxels, features, and tasks. In addition to voxel-level supervision and task-level constraint, a feature-level auto-regression branch is proposed to embed the features of target images for an accurate generation. With the complete multimodal images, we propose a Mul-T network for disease diagnosis, which can not only combine the global and local features but also model the latent interactions and correlations from one modality to another with the cross-modal attention mechanism. Comprehensive experiments on three independent datasets (i.e., ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and OASIS-3) show that the proposed method achieves superior performance in the tasks of image generation and disease diagnosis compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

Recently, there has been growing interest in investigating the possible relationship between PM exposure and the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. However, the precise mechanism by which PM affects neurodegeneration is still unclear, even though several epidemiological and animal model studies have provided mechanistic insights. This article presents a review of the current research on the neurotoxicity of PM and its impact on neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes findings from epidemiological and animal model studies collected through searches in Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. This review paper also discusses the reported effects of PM exposure on the central nervous system and highlights research gaps and future directions. The information presented in this review may inform public health policies aimed at reducing PM exposure and may contribute to the development of new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Further mechanistic and therapeutic research will be needed to fully understand the relationship between PM exposure and neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA), a visual variant of Alzheimer's disease, initially manifests with higher-order visual disorders and parieto/temporo-occipital atrophy. Recent studies have shown remote functional impairment in both distant brain networks and along the calcarine sulcus (V1). Functional alteration in the calcarine differs along its length, reflecting center to periphery visual space differences. Herein, we aim to connect between these two sets of findings by looking at the retinotopic patterns of functional connectivity between large-scale brain networks and V1, comparing patients with normally sighted subjects. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and T1 anatomical scans were obtained from 11 PCA patients and 17 age-matched healthy volunteers. Default mode network (DMN) and fronto parietal network (FPN) were defined and differences between the networks in patients and healthy controls were evaluated at the whole brain level, specifically their connectivity to V1. Connectivity patterns within the DMN and the FPN were similar between the groups, although differences were found in regions within and beyond the networks. Focusing on V1, in the control group we identified the expected pattern of a distributed connectivity along eccentricity, with foveal regions showing stronger connectivity to the FPN and peripheral regions showing stronger connectivity to the DMN. However, in PCA patients we could not identify a clear difference in connectivity along the eccentricities. Lost specialization of function along the calcarine in PCA patients may have further implications on large-scale networks or vice versa. This impairment, distant from the core pathology, might explain patients' visual disabilities.",

        "AbstractText": "Catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) is a promising enzyme-free, isothermal signal amplification strategy, but the relatively time-consuming strand replacement limits its application scenarios. Here, we developed an ultrasound-enhanced catalytic hairpin assembly (UECHA) biosensing platform for early screening of Alzheimer's disease by introducing a portable acoustic-drive platform with functionalized microspheres for effective biomarkers enrichment and fluorescence enhancement. By constructing a gradient ultrasonic field in a microcavity, the platform concentrates the functionalized microspheres in a central position, accompanied by an enhanced fluorescence signal with a specific release. In addition, the programmable frequency modulation can also modify the acoustic potential well and effectively promote non-equilibrium chemical reactions such as CHA (25\u00a0min). Compared with the conventional catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA), UECHA allows for direct and quantitative measurement of AD miRNAs down to 3.55\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-15\u00a0M in 1\u00a0\u03bcL samples.

        "AbstractText": "Stable patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) may discontinue treatment, but the risk of disease activity is unknown. Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) and serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP) are biomarkers of subclinical disease activity and may help risk stratification. In this study, sNfL and sGFAP levels in stable patients were evaluated before and after treatment discontinuation to determine association with disease activity. This observational study included patients enrolled in the Comprehensive Longitudinal Investigation in MS at the Brigham and Women's Hospital who discontinued treatment after >2 years disease activity-free. Two serum samples within 2 years, before and after treatment stop, were sent for sNfL and sGFAP measurements by single-molecule array. Biannual neurologic examinations and yearly MRI scans determined disease activity by 3 time-to-event outcomes: 6-month confirmed disability worsening (CDW), clinical attacks, and MRI activity (new T2 or contrast-enhancing lesions). Associations between each outcome and log-transformed sNfL and sGFAP levels pretreatment stop and posttreatment stop and the percent change were estimated using multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusting for age, disability, disease duration, and duration from attack before treatment stop. Seventy-eight patients (92% female) discontinued treatment at a median (interquartile range) age of 48.5 years (39.0-55.7) and disease duration of 12.3 years (7.5-18.8) and were followed up for 6.3 years (4.2-8.5). CDW occurred in 27 patients (35%), new attacks in 19 (24%), and new MRI activity in 26 (33%). Higher posttreatment stop sNfL level was associated with CDW (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 2.80, 95% CI 1.36-5.76, p = 0.005) and new MRI activity (aHR 3.09, 95% CI 1.42-6.70, p = 0.004). Patients who had >100% increase in sNfL level from pretreatment stop to posttreatment stop had greater risk of CDW (HR 3.87, 95% CI 1.4-10.7, p = 0.009) and developing new MRI activity (HR 4.02, 95% CI 1.51-10.7, p = 0.005). Patients who had >50% increase in sGFAP level also had greater risk of CDW (HR 5.34, 95% CI 1.4-19.9, p = 0.012) and developing new MRI activity (HR 5.16, 95% CI 1.71-15.6, p = 0.004). Stable patients who discontinue treatment may be risk stratified by sNfL and sGFAP levels measured before and after discontinuing treatment.

This is due to an incomplete understanding of the macro-scale anatomy underlying these symptomatologies, a partial overlap in clinical features, and the fact that both phenotypes can emerge from the same pathology and vice-versa. We collected data from a patient cohort of which 52 had dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease, 30 had behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, seven met clinical criteria for behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia but had Alzheimer's disease pathology (behavioral Alzheimer's disease), and 28 had amnestic Alzheimer's disease. We first assessed group-wise differences in clinical and cognitive features and patterns of FDG-PET hypometabolism. We then performed a spectral decomposition of covariance between FDG-PET images to yield latent patterns of relative hypometabolism unbiased by diagnostic classification, which are referred to as \"eigenbrains\". These eigenbrains were subsequently linked to clinical and cognitive data and meta-analytic topics from a large external database of neuroimaging studies reflecting a wide range of mental functions. Finally, we performed a data-driven exploratory linear discriminant analysis to perform eigenbrain-based multiclass diagnostic predictions. Dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia patients were the youngest at symptom onset, followed by behavioral Alzheimer's disease, then amnestic Alzheimer's disease. Dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease patients had worse cognitive performance on nearly all cognitive domains compared to other groups, except verbal fluency which was equally impaired in dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia. Hypometabolism was observed in heteromodal cortices in dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease, temporo-parietal areas in amnestic Alzheimer's disease, and frontotemporal areas in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and behavioral Alzheimer's disease. The unbiased spectral decomposition analysis revealed that relative hypometabolism in heteromodal cortices was associated with worse dysexecutive symptomatology and a lower likelihood of presenting with behavior/personality problems, whereas relative hypometabolism in frontotemporal areas was associated with a higher likelihood of presenting with behavior/personality problems but did not correlate with most cognitive measures. The linear discriminant analysis yielded an accuracy of 82.1% in predicting diagnostic category and did not misclassify any dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease patient for behavioral Alzheimer's disease and vice-versa. Our results strongly suggest a double dissociation in that distinct macro-scale underpinnings underlie predominant dysexecutive versus personality/behavioral symptomatology in dementia syndromes. This has important implications for the implementation of criteria to diagnose and distinguish these diseases and supports the use of data-driven techniques to inform the classification of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Methods: Surveys were collected from 184 participants, over 65\u00a0years of age, who were residents of Kyoto City, Japan. The surveys included the Measurement of the Five Emotions (MFE) and the Dementia Assessment Sheet for the Community-based Integrated Care System (DASC-21). Item-total reliability and internal consistency reliability were assessed using Spearman's correlation test and Cronbach's alpha coefficient analysis. Factor analysis was conducted to identify the main factors related to the theoretically constructed emotional reaction patterns. Criterion-related validity was examined by investigating the correlation between the scores of the 2 surveys (MFE and DASC-21). Results: The factor analysis revealed that the final version of MFE consisted of 5 factors, which accounted for a cumulative contribution rate of 57.71%. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient reached .71, indicating satisfactory internal consistency. There was a negative correlation between the MFE and DASC-21 scores with a correlation coefficient of -.3149. Furthermore, when comparing participants with lower cognitive function (DASC-21 score >26) to those with higher cognitive function, MFE subscale scores in the emotions of \"Sorrow\" and \"Thought\" were significantly lower, suggesting that these particular emotions are related to cognitive impairment. These findings confirmed the reliability and the construct validity of the MFE. Conclusion: The criterion reliability and validity tests provided evidence for the construct validity of the MFE. The negative correlation (coefficient = -.3149) between MFE scores and DASC-21 scores suggested that MFE can serve as a scale for detecting cognitive impairment.",

        "AbstractText": "Informal caregivers (ie, individuals who provide assistance to a known person with health or functional needs, often unpaid) experience high levels of stress. Caregiver stress is associated with negative outcomes for both caregivers and care recipients. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) show promise for improving stress, emotional distress, and sleep disturbance in caregivers of persons with Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD). Commercially available mobile mindfulness apps can deliver MBIs to caregivers of persons with ADRD in a feasible and cost-effective manner. We are conducting a single-blind feasibility proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial (RCT; National Institutes of Health [NIH] stage 1B) comparing 2 free mobile apps: the active intervention Healthy Minds Program (HMP) with within-app text tailored for addressing stress among caregivers of persons with ADRD, versus Wellness App (WA), a time- and dose-matched educational control also tailored for caregivers of persons with ADRD. We aim to recruit 80 geographically diverse and stressed caregivers of persons with ADRD. Interested caregivers use a link or QR code on a recruitment flyer to complete a web-based eligibility screener. Research assistants conduct enrollment phone calls, during which participants provide informed consent digitally. After participants complete baseline surveys, we randomize them to the mindfulness-based intervention (HMP) or educational control podcast app (WA) and instruct them to listen to prescribed content for 10 minutes per day (70 minutes per week) for 12 weeks. Caregivers are blinded to intervention versus control. The study team checks adherence weekly and contacts participants to promote adherence as needed. Participants complete web-based self-report measures at baseline, posttest, and follow-up; weekly process measures are also completed. Primary outcomes are a priori set feasibility benchmarks. Secondary outcomes are stress, emotional distress, sleep disturbance, caregiver burden, mindfulness, awareness, connection, insight, and purpose. We will calculate 1-sided 95% CI to assess feasibility benchmarks. Effect sizes of change in outcomes will be used to examine the proof of concept. Recruitment started on February 20, 2023. We have enrolled 27 caregivers (HMP: n=14; WA: n=13) as of June 2023. Funding began in August 2022, and we plan to finish enrollment by December 2023. Data analysis is expected to begin in May 2024 when all follow-ups are complete; publication of findings will follow. Through this trial, we aim to establish feasibility benchmarks for HMP and WA, as well as establish a proof of concept that HMP improves stress (primary quantitative outcome), emotional distress, sleep, and mindfulness more than WA. Results will inform a future efficacy trial (NIH stage II). HMP has the potential to be a cost-effective solution to reduce stress in caregivers of persons with ADRD, benefiting caregiver health and quality of care as well as patient care.

While these antibodies have been shown to significantly reduce amyloid in the brain, there is little, if any, evidence that they provide clinically meaningful benefit for AD patients by slowing cognitive decline. I have said it before, and I say it again: the reported benefits of anti-amyloid antibodies observed in clinical trials are erroneous and based on misinterpretation of data and a trivial miscalculation. For example, Sims et al. (2023) reported in a phase III clinical trial that donanemab treatment of early symptomatic AD patients with amyloid and tau pathology provided 35% and 36% slowing of clinical progression and cognitive decline, respectively, as measured using the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) psychometric tests.

The prime hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are beta-amyloid plaques (A\u03b2) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). In spite of recent advances and developments in targeting the hallmarks of AD, symptomatic medications that promise neuroprotective activity against AD are currently unable to treat degenerating brain clinically or therapeutically and show little efficacy. The extensive progress of AD therapies over time has resulted in the advent of disease-modifying medications with the potential to alleviate AD. However, due to the presence of a defensive connection between the vascular system and the neural tissues known as the blood-brain barrier (BBB), directing these medications to the site of action in the degenerating brain is the key problem. BBB acts as a highly selective semipermeable membrane that prevents any type of foreign substance from entering the microenvironment of neurons. To overcome this limitation, the revolutionary approach of nanoparticle(NP)/nanocarrier-mediated drug delivery system has marked the era with its unique property to cross, avoid, or disrupt the defensive BBB efficiently and release the modified drug at the target site of action. After comprehensive data mining, this review focuses on the detailed understanding of different types of nanoparticle(NP)/nanocarrier-mediated drug delivery system like liposomes, micelles, gold nanoparticles(NP), polymeric NPs, etc. which have promising potential in carrying the desired drug(cargo) to the location in the degenerated brain thus mitigating the Alzheimer's disease.",

Previously, astrocytes were only considered a scaffold of neurons; in fact, astrocytes perform a variety of functions, including providing support for neuronal structures and energy metabolism, offering isolation and protection and influencing the formation, function and elimination of synapses. Because of these functions, astrocytes play an critical role in central nervous system (CNS) diseases. The regulation of the secretiory factors, receptors, channels and pathways of astrocytes can effectively inhibit the occurrence and development of CNS diseases, such as neuromyelitis optica (NMO), multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease. The expression of aquaporin 4 in AS is directly related to NMO and indirectly involved in the clearance of A\u03b2 and tau proteins in AD. Connexin 43 has a bidirectional effect on glutamate diffusion at different stages of stroke. Interestingly, astrocytes reduce the occurrence of PD through multiple effects such as secretion of related factors, mitochondrial autophagy and aquaporin 4. Therefore, this review is focused on the structure and function of astrocytes and the correlation between astrocytes and CNS diseases and drug treatment to explore the new functions of astrocytes with the astrocytes as the target.

Proteolytic APP processing generates various cleavage products, including extracellular amyloid beta (A\u03b2) and the cytoplasmic APP intracellular domain (AICD). Although the role of AICD in the activation of kinase signaling pathways is well established in the context of full-length APP, little is known about intracellular effects of the AICD fragment, particularly within discrete neuronal compartments. Deficits in fast axonal transport (FAT) and axonopathy documented in AD-affected neurons prompted us to evaluate potential axon-autonomous effects of the AICD fragment for the first time. Vesicle motility assays using the isolated squid axoplasm preparation revealed inhibition of FAT by AICD. Biochemical experiments linked this effect to aberrant activation of selected axonal kinases and heightened phosphorylation of the anterograde motor protein conventional kinesin, consistent with precedents showing phosphorylation-dependent regulation of motors proteins powering FAT. Pharmacological inhibitors of these kinases alleviated the AICD inhibitory effect on FAT. Deletion experiments indicated this effect requires a sequence encompassing the NPTY motif in AICD and interacting axonal proteins containing a phosphotyrosine-binding domain. Collectively, these results provide a proof of principle for axon-specific effects of AICD, further suggesting a potential mechanistic framework linking alterations in APP processing, FAT deficits, and axonal pathology in AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder that appears in adult FMR1 premutation carriers. The neuropathological hallmark of FXTAS is an intranuclear inclusion in neurons and astrocytes. Nearly 200 different proteins have been identified in FXTAS inclusions, being the small ubiquitin-related modifier 2 (SUMO2), ubiquitin and p62 the most highly abundant. These proteins are components of the protein degradation machinery. This study aimed to characterize SUMO2/3 expression levels and autophagy process in human postmortem brain samples and skin fibroblast cultures from FXTAS patients. Results revealed that FXTAS postmortem brain samples are positive for SUMO2/3 conjugates and supported the idea that SUMO2/3 accumulation is involved in inclusion formation. Insights from RNA-sequencing data indicated that SUMOylation processes are significantly upregulated in FXTAS samples. In addition, the analysis of the autophagy flux showed the accumulation of p62 protein levels and autophagosomes in skin fibroblasts from FXTAS patients. Similarly, gene set analysis evidenced a significant downregulation in gene ontology terms related to autophagy in FXTAS samples. Overall, this study provides new evidence supporting the role of SUMOylation and autophagic processes in the pathogenic mechanisms underlying FXTAS.",

        "AbstractText": "Human inducible pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived astrocytes (iAs) are critical to study astrocytes in health and disease. They provide several advantages over human fetal astrocytes in research, which include consistency, availability, disease modeling, customization, and ethical considerations. The generation of iAs is hampered by the requirement of Matrigel matrix coating for survival and proliferation. We provide a protocol demonstrating that human iAs cultured in the absence of Matrigel are viable and proliferative. Further, through a side-by-side comparison of cultures with and without Matrigel, we show significant similarities in astrocyte-specific profiling, including morphology (shape and structure), phenotype (cell-specific markers), genotype (transcriptional expression), metabolic (respiration), and functional aspects (glutamate uptake and cytokine response). In addition, we report that, unlike other CNS cell types, such as neuronal progenitor cells and neurons, iAs can withstand the absence of Matrigel coating. Our study demonstrates that Matrigel is dispensable for the culture of human iPSC-derived astrocytes, facilitating an easy, streamlined, and cost-effective method of generating these cells.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), an age-related degenerative disorder, is characterized by \u03b2-amyloid deposition, abnormal phosphorylation of tau proteins, synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Despite extensive research, there are no medications or therapeutic interventions to completely treat and reverse AD. Herein, we explore the potential of hydrocortisone (HC), a natural and endogenous glucocorticoid known to have potent anti-inflammatory properties, in an A\u03b21-42-induced AD mouse model. Our investigation highlights the beneficial effects of HC administration on cognitive impairment, synaptic function enhancement, and neuronal protection in A\u03b21-42-induced AD mice. Notably, HC treatment effectively suppresses the hyperactivation of microglia and astrocytes, leading to a reduction in proinflammatory factors and alleviation of neuroinflammation. Furthermore, HC intervention demonstrates the capacity to mitigate the generation of ROS and oxidative stress. These compelling findings underscore the potential therapeutic application of HC in AD and present promising opportunities for its utilization in AD prevention and treatment. The implications drawn from our findings indicate that hydrocortisone holds promise as a viable candidate for adjunctive use with other anti-AD drugs for the clinical management of patients presenting with moderate to severe AD.",

        "AbstractText": "The microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) has a critical role in the development and preservation of the nervous system. However, tau's dysfunction and accumulation in the human brain can lead to several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, and frontotemporal dementia. The microtubule binding (MTB) domain plays a significant, important role in determining the tau's pathophysiology, as the core of paired helical filaments PHF6* (275VQIINK280) and PHF6 (306VQIVYK311) of R2 and R3 repeat units, respectively, are formed in this region, which promotes tau aggregation. Post-translational modifications, and in particular lysine acetylation at K280 of PHF6* and K311 of PHF6, have been previously established to promote tau misfolding and aggregation. However, the exact aggregation mechanism is not known. In this study, we established an atomic-level nucleation-extension mechanism of the separated aggregation of acetylated PHF6* and PHF6 hexapeptides, respectively, of tau. We show that the acetylation of the lysine residues promotes the formation of \u03b2-sheet enriched high-ordered oligomers. The Markov state model analysis of ac-PHF6* and ac-PHF6 aggregation revealed the formation of an antiparallel dimer nucleus which could be extended from both sides in a parallel manner to form mixed-oriented and high-ordered oligomers. Our study describes the detailed mechanism for acetylation-driven tau aggregation, which provides valuable insights into the effect of post-translation modification in altering the pathophysiology of tau hexapeptides.",

We observed that per SD decreases in alanine transaminase (ALT; hazard ratio [HR], 0.917; PFDR \u2009<0.001) and per SD increases in aspartate aminotransferase (AST; HR, 1.048; PFDR \u2009=\u20090.010), AST to ALT ratio (HR, 1.195; PFDR \u2009<0.001), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT; HR, 1.066; PFDR \u2009<0.001), alcoholic liver disease (ALD; HR, 2.872; PFDR \u2009<0.001), and fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver (HR, 2.285; PFDR \u2009=\u20090.002), being significantly associated with a higher risk of incident ACD. Restricted cubic spline models identified a strong U-shaped association between Alb and AST and incident ACD (Pnonlinear \u2009<0.05).

We selected 1000 patients from the perioperative neurocognitive disorder risk factor and prognosis (PNDRFAP) database and 999 patients from the perioperative neurocognitive disorder and biomarker lifestyle (PNDABLE) database. Patients in the PNDABLE database have been measured for Alzheimer-related biomarkers in CSF (A\u03b240 , A\u03b242 , P-tau, and tau protein). Mini-mental state examination was used to assess the preoperative mental status of patients. POD was diagnosed using the confusion assessment method and assessed for severity using the memorial delirium assessment scale. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to explore the association of preoperative NLR with POD. What's more, we also performed sensitivity analysis by adding corrected confounders, and the results were almost unchanged. Spearman's rank correlation was used to determine the associations between NLR and Alzheimer-related biomarkers. Mediation analyses with 10,000 bootstrapped iterations were used to explore the mediation effects. Finally, we use decision curves and the nomogram model to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative NLR in predicting POD; we also performed external validation using data from Qilu Hospital. Logistic regression results showed that an elevated preoperative NLR was a risk factor for the development of POD in patients (PNDRFAP: OR\u00a0=\u00a01.067, 95% CI 1.020-1.116; PNDABLE: OR\u00a0=\u00a01.182, 95% CI 1.048-1.335, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Spearman's rank correlation analysis showed a positive but weak correlation between NLR and P-tau/T-tau (R\u00a0=\u00a0.065). The mediating effect results indicate that NLR likely mediates the occurrence of POD through elevated tau protein levels (proportion: 47.47%). The results of the box plots showed statistically significant NLR and CSF biomarkers between the POD and non-POD (NPOD) groups (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05), with higher NLR, P-tau, and T-tau in the POD group than in the NPOD group. In contrast, the NPOD group had higher A\u03b242 levels compared to the POD group. In addition, we used R package to plot the decision curve and nomogram both suggesting a good predictive effect of preoperative NLR on the occurrence of POD. Elevated preoperative NLR levels may be a risk factor for POD and likely mediate the development of POD through elevated P-tau/T-tau levels.",

The gut/brain axis may serve a role in AD pathogenesis. The present study investigated deposition of A\u03b2 in the intestinal epithelium and its potential effects on intestinal barrier function in a transgenic mouse model of AD. To investigate alterations in the structure and functionality of the intestinal mucosal barrier in AD model mice, hematoxylin and eosin staining for Paneth cell count, Alcian blue\u2011periodic acid Schiff staining for goblet cells, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence for mucin (MUC)2 and wheat germ agglutin expression, transmission electron microscopy for mucosal ultrastructure, FITC\u2011labeled dextran assay for intestinal permeability, quantitative PCR for goblet cell precursor expression and western blot analysis for tight junction proteins, MUC2 and inflammatory cytokine detection were performed. The results showed that AD model mice exhibited excessive A\u03b2 deposition in the intestinal epithelium, which was accompanied by increased intestinal permeability, inflammatory changes and decreased expression of tight junction proteins. These alterations in the intestinal barrier led to an increased proliferation of goblet and Paneth cells and increased mucus synthesis. Dysfunction of gut barrier occurs in AD and may contribute to its etiology.

In this article, we review recent evidence that epilepsy may be an initial manifestation of an amyloidopathy or tauopathy that precedes development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients with LOEU demonstrate an increased risk of cognitive decline, and patients with AD have increased prevalence of preceding epilepsy. Moreover, investigations of LOEU that use CSF biomarkers and imaging techniques have identified preclinical neurodegeneration with evidence of amyloid and tau deposition. Overall, findings to date suggest a relationship between acquired, non-lesional late-onset epilepsy and amyloid and tau-related neurodegeneration, which supports that preclinical or prodromal AD is a distinct etiology of late-onset epilepsy. We propose criteria for assessing elevated risk of developing dementia in patients with late-onset epilepsy utilizing clinical features, available imaging techniques, and biomarker measurements.

We have released TCM Database@Taiwan in 2011, and it has been widely disseminated and used. Now, we developed TCMBank, the largest systematic free TCM database, which is an extension of TCM Database@Taiwan. TCMBank contains 9192 herbs, 61\u2009966 ingredients (unduplicated), 15\u2009179 targets, 32\u2009529 diseases, and their pairwise relationships. By integrating multiple data sources, TCMBank provides 3D structure information of ingredients and provides a standard list and detailed information on herbs, ingredients, targets and diseases. TCMBank has an intelligent document identification module that continuously adds TCM-related information retrieved from the literature in PubChem. In addition, driven by TCMBank big data, we developed an ensemble learning-based drug discovery protocol for identifying potential leads and drug repurposing. We take colorectal cancer and Alzheimer's disease as examples to demonstrate how to accelerate drug discovery by artificial intelligence.

The soluble phase of plasma and plasma neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) are increasingly being investigated as sources of biomarkers. The aim of this study was to examine the comparative biomarker potential of these two biofluids, as well as the association between respective biomarkers. Methods: We retrospectively identified three distinct diagnostic groups of 44 individuals who provided samples at baseline and at a mean of 3.1\u00a0years later; 14 were cognitively unimpaired at baseline and remained so (NRM-NRM), 13 had amnestic MCI that progressed to AD dementia (MCI-DEM) and 17 had AD dementia at both timepoints (DEM-DEM). Plasma NDEVs were isolated by immunoaffinity capture targeting the neuronal markers L1CAM, GAP43, and NLGN3. In both plasma and NDEVs, we assessed ATN biomarkers (A\u03b242, A\u03b240, total Tau, P181-Tau) alongside several other exploratory markers. Results: The A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio in plasma and NDEVs was lower in MCI-DEM than NRM-NRM at baseline and its levels in NDEVs decreased over time in all three groups. Similarly, plasma and NDEV-associated A\u03b242 was lower in MCI-DEM compared to NRM-NRM at baseline and its levels in plasma decreased over time in DEM-DEM. For NDEV-associated proBDNF, compared to NRM-NRM, its levels were lower in MCI-DEM and DEM-DEM at baseline, and they decreased over time in the latter group. No group differences were found for other exploratory markers. NDEV-associated A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio and proBDNF achieved the highest areas under the curve (AUCs) for discriminating between diagnostic groups, while proBDNF was positively associated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. No associations were found between the two biofluids for any assessed marker. Discussion: The soluble phase of plasma and plasma NDEVs demonstrate distinct biomarker profiles both at a single time point and longitudinally. The lack of association between plasma and NDEV measures indicates that the two types of biofluids demonstrate distinct biomarker signatures that may be attributable to being derived through different biological processes. NDEV-associated proBDNF may be a useful biomarker for AD diagnosis and monitoring.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and the main cause of dementia in the elderly. AD pathology is characterized by accumulation of microglia around the beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques which assumes disease-specific transcriptional signatures, as for the disease-associated microglia (DAM). However, the regulators of microglial phagocytosis are still unknown. We isolated A\u03b2-laden microglia from the brain of 5xFAD mice for RNA sequencing to characterize the transcriptional signature in phagocytic microglia and to identify the key non-coding RNAs capable of regulating microglial phagocytosis. Through spatial sequencing, we show the transcriptional changes of microglia in the AD mouse brain in relation to A\u03b2 proximity. Finally, we show that phagocytic messenger RNAs are regulated by miR-7a-5p, miR-29a-3p and miR-146a-5p microRNAs and segregate the DAM population into phagocytic and non-phagocytic states. Our study pinpoints key regulators of microglial A\u03b2 clearing capacity suggesting new targets for future therapeutic approaches.",

Using a novel measurement, unhealthy white matter connectivity (UWMC), we interrogated racialized group differences in associations between WMH in AD pathology-affected regions and cognition. UWMC is the proportion of white matter fibers that pass through WMH for every pair of brain regions. Individual regression models tested associations of UWMC in beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) or tau pathology-affected regions with cognition overall, stratified by racialized group, and with a racialized group interaction. In 201 older adults ranging from cognitively unimpaired to AD, BA participants exhibited greater UWMC and worse cognition than nHW participants. UWMC was negatively associated with cognition in 17 and 5 A\u03b2- and tau-affected regions, respectively. Racialization did not modify these relationships. Differential UWMC burden, not differential UWMC-and-cognition associations, may drive clinical AD disparities between racialized groups. Unhealthy white matter connectivity (UWMC) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology-affected brain regions is associated with cognition. Relationships between UWMC and cognition are similar between Black American (BA) and non-Hispanic White (nHW) individuals. More UWMC may partially drive higher clinical AD burden in BA versus nHW populations. UWMC risk factors, particularly social and environmental, should be identified.",

COPD is characterised by persistent airway inflammation, lung function decline, and premature aging with the presence of pulmonary senescent cells. This review proposes that cellular senescence, a state of stable cell cycle arrest linked to ageing; induced by inflammation and oxidative stress in COPD, extends beyond the lungs and impacts the systemic circulation. This pulmonary senescent profile will reach other organs via extracellular vesicles contributing to brain inflammation and damage, and increasing the risk of neurological comorbidities, such as stroke, cerebral small vessel disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The review explores the role of cellular senescence in COPD-associated brain conditions and investigates the relationship between cellular senescence and circadian rhythm in COPD.

This study explores the relationship between blood biomarkers and longitudinal change in cognitive function and regional brain volumes in a cohort of professional fighters. Participants are drawn from a convenience sample of active and retired professional boxers and Mixed Martial Arts fighters and a control group with no prior exposure to head impacts. 3\u00a0T MRI brain imaging, plasma samples, and computerized cognitive testing were obtained at baseline and, for a subset, annually. MRI regional volumes were extracted, along with plasma levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), p-tau231, and N-terminal tau (NTA). Statistical analyses were performed to assess the relationship between plasma levels and regional brain volumes and cognitive performance at baseline and longitudinally. One hundred forty active boxers (mean age: 31 with standard deviation (SD) of 8), 211 active MMA (mean age of 30 with SD of 5), 69 retired boxers (mean age 49 with SD of 9), and 52 control participants (mean age 36 with SD of 12) were included in the analyses. Baseline GFAP levels were highest in the retired boxers (retired boxers v. active MMA: p\u2009=\u20090.0191), whereas active boxers had higher levels of NfL (active boxers v. MMA: p\u2009=\u20090.047).

There is a breakdown of the inner retinal blood barrier, pericyte loss, and capillary non-perfusion or dropout in AD leading to potential enlargement of the mid-peripheral CFZs.

Recent advances in blood-based measurements of phosphorylated tau (pTau) species are promising but still insufficient to address clinical needs.

The objective of the study was to explore the diagnostic accuracy of a blood-based DNA methylation marker panel as a non-invasive tool to identify late-onset Alzheimer patients, compared to age-matched controls. A case-control study was performed. Blood DNA methylation levels at 46 CpG sites (21 genes selected after a comprehensive literature search) were measured by bisulfite pyrosequencing in patients with \"probable AD dementia\" following NIA-AA guidelines (2011) and age- and sex-matched controls recruited at Neurology Department-University Hospital of Navarre, Spain, selected by convenience sampling. Plasma pTau181 levels were determined by Simoa technology. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the optimal model to discriminate AD patients from controls. Furthermore, we carried out a stratified analysis by sex. Final study cohort consisted of 80 AD patients (age-median (IQR) = 79 (11); 58.8% female) and 100 cognitively healthy controls (age 77 (10); 58% female).

Accumulating evidence indicates that the pathological progression of AD is inseparably connected with hypochlorous acid (HClO). However, further exploring the biological function remains an open challenging due to a lack of effective tools to image HClO in AD brains. To this end, a ruthenium(II) luminescence probe, Ru-HClO, is developed for quantitative detection and visualization of HClO in nerve cells and AD brains. Ru-HClO shows quenched luminescence due to the PET process (excited electron transfer from Ru(II) center to diaminomaleonitrile) and the CN bond isomerization in the excited state. The HClO-triggered specific cleavage reaction with Ru-HClO cleaves the CN bond to form highly luminescent Ru-COOH. Ru-HClO shows rapid response speed, high sensitivity and selectivity, excellent biocompatibility, which makes the probe to be applied to semi-quantitative analysis of HClO in nerve cells and high-throughput screening of anti-AD drugs in the AD cell model. Moreover, using Ru-HClO as a probe, present work further validated that the elevated levels of HClO secretion were accompanied by the AD progressed. These findings may provide valuable results for figuring out the biological roles that HClO played in AD but also for accelerating anti-AD therapeutic discovery.",

The early diagnosis of AD is still a great challenge. Herein, inspired by the hierarchical channel structure of natural wood, we design and demonstrate a low-cost and sensitive wood channel-based fluidic membrane for electrochemical sensing of A\u03b2O1-42. In this design, Zn/Cu-2-methylimidazole (Zn/Cu-Hmim) with artificial peroxidase (POD)-like activity was asymmetrically fabricated at one side of the wood channels by biomimetic mineralization and a subsequent ion exchange reaction. The strong affinity between Cu(II) and A\u03b2O1-42 enables Cu(II) species in Zn/Cu-Hmim to be extracted by A\u03b2O1-42, thus suppressing the POD-like performance via Zn/Cu-Hmim disassembly. Using Zn/Cu-Hmim to catalyze the oxidation reaction of 2,2'-diazo-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) by H2O2, the current-voltage (I-V) properties of wood channels are influenced by the generated oxidation product (ABTS\u2022+), thus providing information useful for the quantitative analysis of A\u03b2O1-42. Importantly, the three aggregation states of A\u03b21-42 (A\u03b2M1-42, A\u03b2O1-42, and A\u03b2F1-42) can also be identified, owing to the affinity difference and available reaction sites. The proposed wood membrane provides a novel, assessable, and scalable channel device to develop sensitive electrochemical sensors; moreover, the sustainable wood materials represent alternative candidates for developing channel-structured sensing platforms.",

        "AbstractText": "The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is complex. So far there is no effective drug to treat the disease. The pathological changes of AD began 30 years before symptoms, so early diagnosis is considered to be important for AD treatment. Integrating diagnosis and therapy into a single regent has provided a new opportunity for AD treatment. Given that metal dyshomeostasis is thought to be one of the key factors to cause AD, a Schiff base substituted coumarin (probe 1) has been designed and synthesized as a selective metal chelator for multi-factor anti-AD in this work. The results of metal ions recognition showed that probe 1 had high selective fluorescent turn-on response to Al3+ and fluorescent turn-off response to Cu2+, due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanism. Meanwhile, the results of both in vitro and in vivo bioactivities evaluation including metal chelation, reactive oxide species (ROS) elimination, self-/Cu2+-induced A\u03b2 aggregation showed that 1 and 1-Cu(II) complex had excellent synergistic anti-AD activities. In addition, 1 had low cytotoxicity and was predicted to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Noticeably, X-ray single crystal diffraction of 1-Cu(II) provided molecular level information to explain the structure and theranostic activity relationship. To sum up, 1 may be a promising candidate for the development of AD theranostic agent.",

Some studies have shown that the expressions of some m6A-related genes are significantly regulated by single nucleotide variants (SNV). However, the function of m6A-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (m6A-SNP) remains unclear in multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we identified the disease-associated m6A-SNPs by integrating genome-wide association study (GWAS) and m6A-SNPs from the RMVar database, and confirmed the relationship between these identified m6A-SNPs and their target genes in eQTL analysis and gene differential expression analysis. Finally, 26 genes corresponding to 20 m6A-SNPs with eQTL signals were identified and differentially expressed (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in MS, 15 genes corresponding to 12 m6A-SNPs (P\u00a0<\u00a01e-04) were differentially expressed in AD, and 27 PD-associated m6A-SNPs that regulated the expression of 31 genes were identified. There were 5 HLA genes with eQTL signals (HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB1-AS1) to be detected in the three diseases. In summary, our study provided new insights into understanding the potential roles of these m6A-SNPs in disease pathogenesis as well as therapeutic target.",

We aimed to identify distinct subtypes of AD based on the individualized structural covariance network (IDSCN) analysis and to research the underlying neurobiology mechanisms. In this study, 187 patients with AD (age\u00a0=\u00a073.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.00, 50% female) and 143 matched normal controls (age\u00a0=\u00a074.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.80, 44% female) were recruited from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project database, and T1 images were acquired. We utilized the IDSCN analysis to generate individual-level altered structural covariance network and performed k-means clustering to subtype AD based on structural covariance network. Cognition, disease progression, morphological features, and gene expression profiles were further compared between subtypes, to characterize the heterogeneity in AD. Two distinct AD subtypes were identified in a reproducible manner, and we named the two subtypes as slow progression type (subtype 1, n\u00a0=\u00a0104, age\u00a0=\u00a076.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.44, 42% female) and rapid progression type (subtype 2, n\u00a0=\u00a083, age\u00a0=\u00a071.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.72, 47% female), separately. Subtype 1 had better baseline visuospatial function than subtype 2 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), whereas subtype 2 had better baseline memory function than subtype 1 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Subtype 2 showed worse progression in memory (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), language (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), visuospatial function (p\u00a0=\u00a00.020), and mental state (p\u00a0=\u00a00.038) than subtype 1. Subtype 1 often shared increased structural covariance network, mainly in the frontal lobe and temporal lobe regions, whereas subtype 2 often shared increased structural covariance network, mainly in occipital lobe regions and temporal lobe regions. Functional annotation further revealed that all differential structural covariance network between the two AD subtypes were mainly implicated in memory, learning, emotion, and cognition. Additionally, differences in gray matter volume (GMV) between AD subtypes were identified, and genes associated with GMV differences were found to be enriched in the terms potassium ion transport, synapse organization, and histone modification and the pathways viral infection, neurodegeneration-multiple diseases, and long-term depression. The two distinct AD subtypes were identified and characterized with neuroanatomy, cognitive trajectories, and gene expression profiles.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to cognitive decline and memory loss. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for this condition, so there is a growing interest in developing new anti-AD agents. In this research project, a series of phenyl-quinoline derivatives were designed as potential anti-AD agents. These derivatives were substituted at two different positions on benzyl and phenyl rings. The structures of the derivatives were characterized using techniques such as IR spectroscopy, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and elemental analysis. During the in vitro screening, the derivatives were tested against both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). It was observed that most of the derivatives showed higher selectivity against BChE compared to AChE. Among the derivatives, analog 7n (with a methoxy group at R1 and a 4-bromine substituent at R2 exhibited the highest potency, with a 75-fold improvement in the activity compared to the positive control. Importantly, this potent analog demonstrated no toxicity at the tested concentration on SH-SY5Y cells, indicating its potential as a safe anti-AD agent. The level of GSK-3\u03b2 was also reduced after treatments with 7n at 50\u202f\u03bcM.

        "AbstractText": "The term extracellular vesicles (EVs) refers to a variety of heterogeneous nanovesicles secreted by almost all cell types, primarily for intercellular communication and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The role of EVs has been widely reported in the genesis and progression of multiple pathological conditions, and these vesicles are suggested to serve as 'liquid biopsies'. In addition to their use as biomarkers, EVs secreted by specific cell types, especially with stem cell properties, have shown promise as cell-free nanotherapeutics. Stem cell-derived EVs (SC-EVs) have been increasingly used as an attractive alternative to stem cell therapies and have been reported to promote regeneration of aging-associated tissue loss and function. SC-EVs treatment ameliorates brain and peripheral aging, reproductive dysfunctions and inhibits cellular senescence, thereby reversing several aging-related disorders and dysfunctions. The anti-aging therapeutic potential of SC-EVs depends on multiple factors, including the type of stem cells, the age of the source stem cells, and their physiological state. In this review, we briefly describe studies related to the promising effects of SC-EVs against various aging-related pathologies, and then we focus in-depth on the therapeutic benefits of SC-EVs against Alzheimer's disease, one of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases in elderly individuals. Numerous studies in transgenic mouse models have reported the usefulness of SC-EVs in targeting the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, including amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation, leading to improved neuronal protection, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive measures. Cell culture studies have further identified the underlying molecular mechanisms through which SC-EVs reduce amyloid beta (A\u03b2) levels or shift microglia phenotype from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory state. Interestingly, multiple routes of administration, including nasal delivery, have confirmed that SC-EVs could cross the blood-brain barrier. Due to this, SC-EVs have also been tested to deliver specific therapeutic cargo molecule/s (e.g., neprilysin) to the brain. Despite these promises, several challenges related to quality control, scalability, and biodistribution remain, hindering the realization of the vast clinical promise of SC-EVs.",

The model fits seven parameters reflecting the encoding, calculation, and production errors associated with inaccuracies in PI. We compared these parameters across younger and older participants and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), including those with (MCI+) and without (MCI-) cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD neuropathology. MCI patients showed overestimation of the angular turn in the outbound path and more variable inbound distances and directions compared with healthy elderly. MCI+ were best distinguished from MCI- patients by overestimation of outbound turns and more variable inbound directions. Our results suggest that overestimation of turning underlies the PI errors seen in patients with early AD, indicating specific neural pathways and diagnostic behaviors for further research.",

Thus, we evaluated an AD-focused BCT, the Memory Alteration Test (M@T), to detect biomarker-proven AD and quantify its correlation with neurodegeneration and CSF AD biomarkers in a cohort of participants from Lima, Peru. This is a secondary analysis of a cohort of 185 participants: 63 controls, 53 with amnestic MCI (aMCI), and 69 with dementia due to AD. Participants underwent testing with M@T and a gold standard neuropsychological battery. We measured T-tau, p-tau and \u03b2-amyloid in CSF, and evaluated neurodegeneration via medial temporal atrophy score in MRI. We used Receiver-Operator Curves to determine the discriminative capacity of the total M@T score and its subdomains. We used the Pearson coefficient to correlate M@T score and CSF biomarkers. The M@T had an AUC of 0.994 to discriminate between controls and cognitively impaired (aMCI or AD) patients, and an AUC of 0.98 to differentiate between aMCI and AD patients. Free-recall and cued recall had the highest AUCs of all subdomains. Total score was strongly correlated with t-tau (-0.77) and p-tau (-0.72), and moderately correlated with \u03b2-amyloid (0.66). The AUC for discrimination of neurodegeneration was 0.87. The M@T had excellent discrimination of aMCI and dementia due to AD. It was strongly correlated with CSF biomarkers and had good discrimination of neurodegeneration. In LMICs, it may represent a cost-effective screening tool for aMCI and dementia caused by AD.",

Soluble A\u03b2 oligomers have been identified as neurotoxic species in AD and targeted in antibody-based drug development to mitigate cognitive decline. However, controversy exists concerning their efficacy and safety. In this study, we propose an alternative strategy to inhibit the formation of A\u03b2 oligomers by selectively oxidizing specific amino acids in the A\u03b2 sequence, thereby preventing its aggregation. Targeted oxidation was achieved using biocompatible and blood-brain barrier-permeable multicomponent nanoscintillators that generate singlet oxygen upon X-ray interaction. Surface-modified scintillators interact selectively with A\u03b2 and, upon X-ray irradiation, inhibit the formation of neurotoxic aggregates both in vitro and in vivo. Feeding transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans expressing human A\u03b2 with the nanoscintillators and subsequent irradiation with soft X-ray reduced A\u03b2 oligomer levels, extended lifespan, and restored memory and behavioral deficits.

Methods: A scoping review of the literature was conducted. Five databases (PubMed/Medline, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Embase) were searched for primary articles comparing incidence or prevalence of cognitive impairment among sexual and gender minority (SGM) groups versus non-SGM groups. Two reviewers independently screened articles and conducted risk-of-bias assessment on eligible articles. Results: Fifteen primary studies were eligible. Most studies (n\u2009=\u200913) were cross-sectional, with moderate to critical risk of bias. Among eight studies examining self-reported cognitive impairment, seven reported a higher prevalence among some SGM groups versus non-SGM groups. Among seven studies using objective measures of cognitive impairment, three examined prevalence of clinician-documented diagnosis of dementia, of which two reported a higher prevalence specifically among transgender versus cisgender individuals. Among the other four studies examining objective measures, two reported poorer cognitive performance or memory, one reported better performance, and another reported no difference. Comparisons across studies were challenging due to inconsistencies in how SOGI and cognitive impairment were operationalized, and the factors used for statistical adjustment; some studies adjusted for putative intermediary factors that potentially explain differences in cognitive impairment. Conclusions: Whereas most published studies identified a positive relationship between SOGI status and self-reported cognitive impairment, evidence is mixed with regard to objective cognitive performance. Well-designed longitudinal, observational studies are needed, using objective measures of cognitive function, with careful consideration of confounding versus intermediary risk factors.",

Brain glucose uptake (BGU) quantified with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET)) was also performed in a subset of subjects during clamp. In dataset A, 48 participants were studied during fasting with brain 1H-MRS, while in dataset B 21 participants underwent paired brain 1H-MRS acquisitions under fasting and clamp conditions. In dataset C 16 subjects underwent brain 18F-FDG-PET and 1H-MRS during clamp. In the fasting state, total N-acetylaspartate was lower in subjects with obesity, while brain myo-inositol increased in response to hyperinsulinemia similarly in both lean participants and subjects with obesity. During clamp, BGU correlated positively with brain glutamine/glutamate, total choline, and total creatine levels. Following weight loss, brain creatine levels were increased, whereas increases in other metabolites remained not significant.

Preclinical imaging, such as micro-magnetic resonance imaging (\u03bcMRI) can produce tomographic datasets of murine vasculature across length scales and organs, which is of outmost importance to study tumor progression, angiogenesis, or vascular risk factors for diseases such as Alzheimer's. Training a neural network capable of accurate segmentation results requires a sufficiently large amount of labelled data, which takes a long time to compile. Recently, several reasonably automated approaches have emerged in the preclinical context but still require significant manual input and are less accurate than the deep learning approach presented in this paper-quantified by the Dice score.

Certain blood biomarkers (eg, serum amyloid A [SAA] and serum homocysteine [Hcy], which increase in IBD and MCI; brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF], which decreases in MCI and AD but is not clearly modified in IBD; and S100 calcium-binding protein B [S100B], which increases in the blood-brain barrier and neuronal lesions) might predict the stage of MCI or dementia or progression to a further state. The gut-brain axis (GBA) might be the key to the development of MCI in patients with IBD, along with systemic inflammation and the possible and unknown adverse effects of disease-modifying medication. The aim of this study is to investigate whether GBA interactions play a role in MCI development in patients with IBD. A case-control study will be conducted on at least 100 patients diagnosed with IBD, matched with 100 healthy individual controls. The matching will include sex, age, and education. Patients will be fully examined, and a full interview and a neurological and cognitive examination will be performed. The primary clinical outcomes will be cognitive test scores (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Trail Making Test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, forward and backward digit span testing). Depression, stress, and anxiety screening will also be performed. Blood samples from all participants will be collected, and aliquots will be immediately stored in a biobank. Primary laboratory outcomes will include serum levels of presumed cognitive dysfunction blood biomarkers SAA, Hcy, S100B, and BDNF. Follow-up will be performed at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore geriatric care providers' perspectives about technology-based interventions to support intrinsic capacity. A survey involving 20 geriatricians or clinical experts in the fields of intrinsic capacity and active and healthy aging was conducted in Italy, France, Germany, and Japan between August and September 2021. The qualitative findings pointed out relevant domains for eHealth interventions and provided examples for successful practices that support subjective well-being under the intrinsic capacity framework (the benefits offered by personalized interventions, especially by promoting health literacy but avoiding intrusiveness). Moreover, eHealth interventions could be used as a bridge that facilitates and enables social engagement; an instrument that facilitates communication between doctors and patients; and a tool to enrich the monitoring actions of medical staff. There is an unexplored and significant role for such geriatric perspectives to help the development process and evaluate the evidence-based results on the effectiveness of technologies for older people. This is possible only when clinicians collaborate with data scientists, engineers, and developers in order to match the complex daily needs of older adults.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Elucidating the Role of Lipids in the Aggregation of Amyloidogenic Proteins.",
        "AbstractText": "ConspectusThe abrupt aggregation of misfolded proteins is linked to the onset and spread of amyloidogenic diseases, including diabetes type 2, systemic amyloidosis, and Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD). Although the exact cause of these pathological processes is unknown, a growing body of evidence suggests that amyloid diseases are triggered by misfolded or unfolded proteins, forming highly toxic oligomers. These transient species exhibit high structural and morphological heterogeneity. Protein oligomers can also propagate into \u03b2-sheet-rich filaments that braid and coil with other filaments to form amyloid fibrils and supramolecular structures with both flat and twisted morphologies. Microscopic examination of protein deposits formed in the brains of both AD and PD patients revealed the presence of fragments of lipid membranes. Furthermore, nanoscale infrared analysis of ex vivo extracted fibrils revealed the presence of lipids in their structure (Zhaliazka, K.; Kurouski, D. Protein Sci. 2023, 32, e4598). These findings demonstrated that lipid bilayers could play an important role in the aggregation of misfolded proteins.Experimental findings summarized in this Account show that (i) lipids uniquely change the aggregation rate of amyloidogenic proteins. In this case, the observed changes in the rates directly depend on the net charge of the lipid and the length and saturation of lipid fatty acids (FAs). For instance, zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC) with 14:0 FAs inhibited the aggregation of insulin, lysozyme, and \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn), whereas anionic phosphatidylserine with the same FAs dramatically accelerated the aggregation rate of these proteins (Dou, T., et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 4407. Matveyenka, M., et al. FASEB J. 2022, 36, e22543. Rizevsky, S., et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2022, 13, 2467). Furthermore, (ii) lipids uniquely alter the secondary structure and morphology of protein oligomers and fibrils formed in their presence. Utilization of nano-infrared spectroscopy revealed that such aggregates, as well as ex vivo extracted fibrils, possessed lipids in their structure. These findings are significant because (iii) lipids uniquely alter the toxicity of amyloid oligomers and fibrils formed in their presence. Specifically, PC lowered the toxicity of insulin and lysozyme oligomers, whereas \u03b1-Syn oligomers formed in the presence of this phospholipid were found to be significantly more toxic to rat dopaminergic cells compared to \u03b1-Syn oligomers grown in the lipid-free environment. Thus, the toxicity of protein oligomers and fibrils is directly determined by the chemical structure of the lipid and the secondary structure of amyloidogenic proteins (Dou, T., et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 4407. Matveyenka, M., et al. FASEB J. 2022, 36, e22543. Rizevsky, S., et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2022, 13, 2467). Experimental results discussed in this Account also suggest that amyloidogenic diseases could be caused by pathological changes in the lipid composition of both plasma and organelle membranes, which, in turn, may trigger protein aggregation that results in the formation of highly toxic oligomers and fibrils. Finally, the Account discusses the effects of polyunsaturated FAs on the aggregation properties of amyloidogenic proteins. Experimental findings reported by the author's laboratory revealed that polyunsaturated FAs drastically accelerated the aggregation rate of both insulin and \u03b1-Syn as well as strongly changed the secondary structure of amyloid fibrils formed in their presence.",

The goal of this paper is to provide the first complete description of the enrolled cohort, which details the baseline characteristics and data completion. We also describe the study modifications necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and lay the foundation for future work using this cohort. SAGES II is a prospective observational cohort study of community-dwelling adults age 65 and older undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. Participants were assessed preoperatively, throughout hospitalization, and at 1, 2, 6, 12, and 18\u2009months following discharge to assess cognitive and physical functioning. Since participants were enrolled throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, procedural modifications were designed to reduce missing data and allow for high data quality. About 420 participants were enrolled with a mean (standard deviation) age of 73.4 (5.6) years, including 14% minority participants. Eighty-eight percent of participants had either total knee or hip replacements; the most common surgery was total knee replacement with 210 participants (50%). Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which required the use of novel procedures such as video assessments, there were minimal missing interviews during hospitalization and up to 1-month follow-up; nearly 90% of enrolled participants completed interviews through 6-month follow-up. While there are many longitudinal studies of older adults, this study is unique in measuring health outcomes following surgery, along with risk factors for delirium through the application of novel biomarkers-including fluid (plasma and cerebrospinal fluid), imaging, and electrophysiological markers.

Here, we investigated the relationship between BBB permeability, indicated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/plasma albumin quotient (Qalb), and CSF indexes of neuroinflammation in a cohort of biologically defined AD patients. Fifty-nine consecutive patients with mild cognitive impairment\u2009(MCI) or early AD (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] >22) underwent CSF analysis for inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, Il-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1], interferon-\u03b3 [IFN-\u03b3], granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]). Using backward stepwise linear regression analysis, we explored the potential influence of each cytokine CSF level on Qalb considering age, sex, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) as covariates. Higher levels of IL-4 (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.356, 0.005) and IL-8 (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.249, 0.05) were associated with higher Qalb values, while macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b2) (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.274; p\u2009=\u20090.032) and TNF-\u03b1 (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.248; p\u2009=\u20090.031) showed a significant negative association with BBB permeability. Age was also positively associated with Qalb (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.283; p\u2009=\u20090.016). Despite the overall integrity of the BBB, its permeability could either influence or be influenced by central neuroinflammation, reflected by CSF cytokine levels. This is in line with previous studies that showed that patients with a more intact barrier are those with more prominent neurodegeneration. Our findings suggest that different neuroinflammatory profiles can be associated with different levels of BBB permeability in AD.",

This study investigates a bispecific modular fusion protein composed of gantenerumab, a fully human monoclonal anti- amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) antibody under investigation for AD treatment, with a human transferrin receptor 1-directed Brainshuttle\u2122 module (trontinemab; RG6102, INN trontinemab). In vitro, trontinemab showed a similar binding affinity to fibrillar A\u03b240 and A\u03b2 plaques in human AD brain sections to gantenerumab. A single intravenous administration of trontinemab (10\u2009mg/kg) or gantenerumab (20\u2009mg/kg) to non-human primates (NHPs, Macaca fascicularis), was well tolerated in both groups. Immunohistochemistry indicated increased trontinemab uptake into the brain endothelial cell layer and parenchyma, and more homogeneous distribution, compared with gantenerumab. Brain and plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for trontinemab were estimated by nonlinear mixed-effects modeling with correction for tissue residual blood, indicating a 4-18-fold increase in brain exposure. A previously developed clinical PK/pharmacodynamic model of gantenerumab was adapted to include a brain compartment as a driver of plaque removal and linked to the allometrically scaled above model from NHP. The new brain exposure-based model was used to predict trontinemab dosing regimens for effective amyloid reduction. Simulations from these models were used to inform dosing of trontinemab in the first-in-human clinical trial.",

Despite several breakthroughs, there exists a lack of disease-modifying treatment strategies for these diseases, as the available drugs provide symptomatic relief and bring along side effects. Bioactive compounds are reported to bear neuroprotective properties with minimal toxicity, however, a detailed elucidation of their modes of neuroprotection is lacking. The review elucidates the neuroprotective mechanism(s) of some of the major phyto-compounds in pre-clinical and clinical studies of AD and PD to understand their potential in combating these diseases. Curcumin, eugenol, resveratrol, baicalein, sesamol and so on have proved efficient in countering the pathological hallmarks of AD and PD. Curcumin, resveratrol, caffeine and so on have reached the clinical phases of these diseases, while aromadendrin, delphinidin, cyanidin and xanthohumol are yet to be extensively explored in pre-clinical phases. The review highlights the need for extensive investigation of these compounds in the clinical stages of these diseases so as to utilize their disease-modifying abilities in the real field of treatment. Moreover, poor pharmacokinetic properties of natural compounds are constraints to their therapeutic yields and this review suggests a plausible contribution of nanotechnology in overcoming these limitations.",

        "AbstractText": "In recent years, the role of new factors in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases has been investigated. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. Although pathological changes such as the accumulation of aggregated proteins in the brain and inflammatory responses are known as the main factors involved in the development of these diseases, new studies show the role of gut microbiota and circadian rhythm in the occurrence of these changes. However, the association between circadian rhythm and gut microbiota in AD and PD has not yet been investigated. Recent results propose that alterations in circadian rhythm regulators, mainly Bmal1, may regulate the abundance of gut microbiota. This correlation has been linked to the regulation of the expression of immune-related genes and Bmal-1 mediated oscillation of IgA and hydrogen peroxide production. These data seem to provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of melatonin inhibiting the progression of AD and PD. Therefore, this manuscript aims to review the role of the gut microbiota and circadian rhythm in health and AD and PD and also presents a hypothesis on the effect of melatonin on their communication.",

ISF plays a crucial role in delivering nutrients and clearing waste products from the brain. This narrative review focuses on the use of MRI techniques to measure various ISF characteristics in humans. The complementary value of contrast-enhanced and noncontrast-enhanced techniques is highlighted. While contrast-enhanced MRI methods allow measurement of ISF transport and flow, they lack quantitative assessment of ISF properties. Noninvasive MRI techniques, including multi-b-value diffusion imaging, free-water-imaging, T2 -decay imaging, and DTI along the PVS, offer promising alternatives to derive ISF measures, such as ISF volume and diffusivity. The emerging role of these MRI techniques in investigating ISF alterations in neurodegenerative diseases (eg, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease) and cerebrovascular diseases (eg, cerebral small vessel disease and stroke) is discussed. This review also emphasizes current challenges of ISF imaging, such as the microscopic scale at which ISF has to be measured, and discusses potential focus points for future research to overcome these challenges, for example, the use of high-resolution imaging techniques. Noninvasive MRI methods for measuring ISF characteristics hold significant potential and may have a high clinical impact in understanding the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disorders, as well as in evaluating the efficacy of ISF-targeted therapies in clinical trials.

Here, we leveraged automated word-property analysis to capture neurocognitive markers of AD vis-\u00e0-vis behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Patients and healthy controls completed two fluency tasks. We counted valid responses and computed each word's frequency, granularity, neighborhood, length, familiarity, and imageability. These features were used for group-level discrimination, patient-level identification, and correlations with executive and neural (magnetic resonanance imaging [MRI], functional MRI [fMRI], electroencephalography [EEG]) patterns. Valid responses revealed deficits in both disorders. Conversely, frequency, granularity, and neighborhood yielded robust group- and subject-level discrimination only in AD, also predicting executive outcomes. Disease-specific cortical thickness patterns were predicted by frequency in both disorders. Default-mode and salience network hypoconnectivity, and EEG beta hypoconnectivity, were predicted by frequency and granularity only in AD. Word-property analysis of fluency can boost AD characterization and diagnosis. We report novel word-property analyses of verbal fluency in AD and bvFTD. Standard valid response counts captured deficits and brain patterns in both groups. Specific word properties (e.g., frequency, granularity) were altered only in AD.

The results showed that NA delayed the decline of locomotion and learning ability caused by D-galactose/AlCl3, increased the activity of total superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and reduced the content of malondialdehyde in vivo. Besides, NA reduced the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, increased the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, alleviated the cell morphology damage induced by D-galactose/AlCl3 in hippocampus and liver tissue. Furthermore, the intervention of NA upregulated the expression levels of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR genes and downregulated the expression levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 genes. Therefore, we speculate the intervention of NA could be an effective way in improving cognitive impairment through the activation of PI3K signaling pathway.

University of California, San Francisco Memory and Aging Center. Samples were collected for the study from 2017 to 2021. Participants with EOAD were diagnosed with AD prior to age 65. Data were last analyzed September 2023. The primary analysis (scRNA-seq) examined whether EOAD was associated with altered frequency of any PBMC subsets. Secondary analysis (ddPCR) measured marker gene expression in CD4 T cells. Over 182,000 individual PBMC transcriptomes were analyzed by scRNA-seq from 16 individuals (mean [SD] age at sample collection, 52.2 [9.6] years; 8 [50.0%] were female; 8 [50.0%] had clinical diagnosis of AD). The relative abundance of PBMC subsets was tested for association with EOAD while controlling for age and sex. Of 19 PBMC clusters, one cluster, representing interferon signaling-associated gene (ISAG) hi T cells, was significantly expanded in EOAD ( P = 0.005). A validation cohort consisting of 19 individuals (mean [SD] age at sample collection, 57.7 [4.1] years; 13 [68.4%] were female; 9 [47.4%] had clinical diagnosis of AD) was used for CD4 T cell isolation and ddPCR analysis. Expression of MX1 and IFI6 , marker genes for ISAG hi T cells, was significantly elevated in participants with EOAD ( P = 0.002 and P = 0.04, respectively). Secondary analyses of independent scRNA-seq datasets from later-onset AD and familial tauopathy indicated that ISAG hi T cells are detected but not elevated in these related diseases. ISAG hi T cells, which appear primed for antiviral activity, are significantly and specifically expanded in EOAD. Additional research into the role of this rare cell type in neurodegeneration is warranted. Question: Is early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) associated with a specific peripheral immune signature?Findings: We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of >182,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells and identified striking expansion of a subset of CD4 T cells termed interferon (IFN) signaling-associated gene (ISAG) hi T cells. We confirmed this finding by isolating CD4 T cells from additional participants with EOAD and measuring increased expression of ISAG hi marker genes.

In this report, we presented a machine learning pipeline, namely \"Biomarker discovery process at binomial decision point\" (2BDP) that took an integrative approach in systematically curating independent variables (e.g., multiple molecular markers) to explain an output variable (e.g., clinical landmark) of binary in nature. In a logical sequence, 2BDP includes feature selection, unsupervised model development and cross validation. In the present work, the efficiency of 2BDP was demonstrated by finding three biomarker panels that independently explained three stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) marked as Braak stages I, II and III, respectively. We designed three assortments from the entire cohort based on these Braak stages; subsequently, each assortment was split into two populations at Braak score I, II or III. 2BDP systematically integrated random forest and logistic regression fitting model to find biomarker panels with minimum features that explained these three assortments, e.g., significantly differentiated two populations segregated by Braak stage I, II or III, respectively. Thereafter, the efficacies of these panels were measured by the area under the curve (AUC) values of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot. The AUC-ROC was calculated by two cross-validation methods. Final set of gene markers was a mix of novel and a priori established AD signatures. These markers were weighted by unique coefficients and linearly connected in a group of 2-10 to explain Braak stage I, II or III by AUC\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.8.

Methods: Individuals exposed to bumetanide or furosemide were identified in the Stanford University electronic health record using the de-identified Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership platform. We matched the AD case cohort to a control cohort (1:20 case:control) on gender, race, ethnicity, and hypertension, and controlled for variables that could potentially be collinear with bumetanide exposure and/or AD diagnosis. Among individuals older than 65\u00a0years, 5,839 AD cases and 116,103 matched controls were included. A total of 1,759 patients (54 cases and 1,705 controls) were exposed to bumetanide. Results: After adjusting for socioeconomic status and other confounders, the exposure of bumetanide and furosemide was significantly associated with reduced AD risk (respectively, bumetanide odds ratio [OR] = 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-0.36; p = 4.0 \u00d7 10-11; furosemide OR = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.38-0.47; p < 2.0 \u00d7 10-16). Discussion: Our study replicates in an independent sample that a history of bumetanide exposure is associated with reduced AD risk while also highlighting an association of the most common loop diuretic (furosemide) with reduced AD risk. These associations need to be additionally replicated, and the mechanism of action remains to be investigated.",

        "AbstractText": "Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) lesions via visual examination of Electroencephalography (EEG) signals poses a considerable challenge. This has prompted the exploration of deep learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Visual Transformers (ViTs), for AD prediction. However, the classification performance of CNN-based methods has often been deemed inadequate. This is primarily attributed to CNNs struggling with extracting meaningful lesion signals from the complex and noisy EEG data. In contrast, ViTs have demonstrated proficiency in capturing global signal patterns. In light of these observations, we propose a novel approach to enhance AD risk assessment. Our proposition involves a hybrid architecture, merging the strengths of CNNs and ViTs to compensate for their respective feature extraction limitations. Our proposed Dual-Branch Feature Fusion Network (DBN) leverages both CNN and ViT components to acquire texture features and global semantic information from EEG signals. These elements are pivotal in capturing dynamic electrical signal changes in the cerebral cortex. Additionally, we introduce Spatial Attention (SA) and Channel Attention (CA) blocks within the network architecture. These attention mechanisms bolster the model's capacity to discern abnormal EEG signal patterns from the amalgamated features. To make well-informed predictions, we employ a two-factor decision-making mechanism. Specifically, we conduct correlation analysis on predicted EEG signals from the same subject to establish consistency. This is then combined with results from the Clinical Neuropsychological Scale (MMSE) assessment to comprehensively evaluate the subject's susceptibility to AD. Our experimental validation on the publicly available OpenNeuro database underscores the efficacy of our approach. Notably, our proposed method attains an impressive 80.23% classification accuracy in distinguishing between AD, Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Normal Control (NC) subjects. This outcome outperforms prevailing state-of-the-art methodologies in EEG-based AD prediction. Furthermore, our methodology enables the visualization of salient regions within pathological images, providing invaluable insights for interpreting and analyzing AD predictions.",

        "AbstractText": "Serjania erecta Raldk is an essential genetic resource due to its anti-inflammatory, gastric protection, and anti-Alzheimer properties. However, the genetic and evolutionary aspects of the species remain poorly known. Here, we sequenced and assembled the complete chloroplast genome of S. erecta and used it in a comparative analysis within the Sapindaceae family. S. erecta has a chloroplast genome (cpDNA) of 159,297 bp, divided into a Large Single Copy region (LSC) of 84,556 bp and a Small Single Copy region (SSC) of 18,057 bp that are surrounded by two Inverted Repeat regions (IRa and IRb) of 28,342 bp. Among the 12 species used in the comparative analysis, S. erecta has the fewest long and microsatellite repeats. The genome structure of Sapindaceae species is relatively conserved; the number of genes varies from 128 to 132 genes, and this variation is associated with three main factors: (1) Expansion and retraction events in the size of the IRs, resulting in variations in the number of rpl22, rps19, and rps3 genes; (2) Pseudogenization of the rps2 gene; and (3) Loss or duplication of genes encoding tRNAs, associated with the duplication of trnH-GUG in X. sorbifolium and the absence of trnT-CGU in the Dodonaeoideae subfamily. We identified 10 and 11 mutational hotspots for Sapindaceae and Sapindoideae, respectively, and identified six highly diverse regions (tRNA-Lys - rps16, ndhC - tRNA-Val, petA - psbJ, ndhF, rpl32 - ccsA, and ycf1) are found in both groups, which show potential for the development of DNA barcode markers for molecular taxonomic identification of Serjania. We identified that the psaI gene evolves under neutrality in Sapindaceae, while all other chloroplast genes are under strong negative selection. However, local positive selection exists in the ndhF, rpoC2, ycf1, and ycf2 genes. The genes ndhF and ycf1 also present high nucleotide diversity and local positive selection, demonstrating significant potential as markers. Our findings include providing the first chloroplast genome of a member of the Paullinieae tribe. Furthermore, we identified patterns in variations in the number of genes and selection in genes possibly associated with the family's evolutionary history.",

        "AbstractText": "Amyloid is defined as a fibrous quaternary structure formed by assembling protein or peptide monomers into intermolecularly hydrogen linked \u03b2-sheets. There is a prevalent issue with protein aggregation and the buildup of amyloid molecules, which results in human neurological illnesses including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. But it is now evident that many organisms, like bacteria, fungi as well as humans, use the same fibrillar structure to carry out a variety of biological functions, such as structure and protection supporting interface transitions and cell-cell recognition, protein control and storage, epigenetic inheritance, and memory. Recent discoveries of self-assembling amyloidogenic peptides and proteins, based on the amyloid core structure, give rise to interesting biomaterials with potential uses in numerous industries. These functions dramatically diverge from the initial conception of amyloid fibrils as intrinsically diseased entities. Apart from the natural ability of amyloids to spontaneously arrange themselves and their exceptional material characteristics, this aspect has prompted extensive research into engineering artificial amyloids for generating various nanostructures, molecular substances, and combined materials. Here, we discuss significant developments in the artificial design of useful amyloids as well as how amyloid materials serve as examples of how function emerges from protein self-assembly at various length scales.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by a gradual and steady deterioration in cognitive function over time. At least 50 million people worldwide are considered to have AD or another form of dementia. AD is marked by a gradual decline in cognitive abilities, memory deterioration and neurodegenerative transformations within the brain. The intricate and multifaceted nature of polygenic AD presents significant challenges within the landscape of drug development. The pathophysiology of AD unfolds in a non-linear and dynamic pattern, encompassing various systems and giving rise to a multitude of factors and hypotheses that contribute to the disease's onset. These encompass theories such as the beta-amyloid hypothesis, cholinergic hypothesis, tau hypothesis, oxidative stress and more. In the realm of drug development, polypharmacological drug profiles have emerged as a strategy that can yield combined or synergistic effects, effectively mitigating undesirable side effects and significantly enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of essential medications. With this concept in mind, our in-silico study sought to delve into the binding interactions of a diverse array of colchicine derivative compounds. These derivatives are chosen for their potential anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-neurodegenerative and neuroprotective properties against Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated compound interactions with AD-related targets, utilizing comprehensive molecular docking and dynamic simulations. COM111X showed impressive docking with acetylcholinesterase, indicating potential as an anti-Alzheimer's drug. COM112Y displayed strong docking scores with PDE4D and butyrylcholinesterase, suggesting dual inhibition for Alzheimer's treatment. Further in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo studies are warranted to explore these findings.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

        "AbstractText": "Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and hyper-phosphorylated tau are key hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with an accumulation of both proteins linked to hippocampal synaptic dysfunction. Recent evidence indicates that A\u03b2 drives mis-localisation of tau from axons to synapses, resulting in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) internalisation and impaired excitatory synaptic function. These tau-driven synaptic impairments are thought to underlie the cognitive deficits in AD. Consequently, limiting the synapto-toxic effects of tau may prevent AD-related cognitive deficits. Increasing evidence links leptin dysfunction with higher AD risk, and numerous studies have identified neuroprotective properties of leptin in AD models of A\u03b2-induced toxicity. However, it is unclear if leptin protects against tau-related synaptic dysfunction. Here we show that A\u03b21-42 significantly increases dendritic and synaptic levels of tau and p-tau in hippocampal neurons, and these effects were blocked by leptin. In accordance with GSK-3\u03b2 being involved in tau phosphorylation, the protective effects of leptin involve PI 3-kinase (PI3K) activation and inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2. A\u03b21-42 -driven synaptic targeting of tau was associated with the removal of GluA1-containing AMPARs from synapses, which was also inhibited by leptin-driven inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2. Direct application of oligomeric tau to hippocampal neurons caused internalisation of GluA1-containing AMPARs and this effect was blocked by prior application of leptin. Similarly, leptin prevented the ability of tau to block induction of activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) at hippocampal SC-CA1 synapses. These findings increase our understanding of the neuroprotective actions of leptin in the early pre-clinical stages of AD and further validate the leptin system as a therapeutic target in AD.",

Therefore, the therapeutic targeting of microglia in AD is of high clinical interest. While previous investigation has focused on the innate immune receptors governing microglial functions in response to A\u03b2 plaques, how microglial innate immune responses are regulated is not well understood. Interestingly, many of these microglial innate immune receptors contain unique cytoplasmic motifs, termed immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating and inhibitory motifs (ITAM/ITIM), that are commonly known to regulate immune activation and inhibition in the periphery. In this review, we summarize the diverse functions employed by microglia in response to A\u03b2 plaques and also discuss the innate immune receptors and intracellular signaling players that guide these functions. Specifically, we focus on the role of ITAM and ITIM signaling cascades in regulating microglia innate immune responses. A better understanding of how microglial innate immune responses are regulated in AD may provide novel therapeutic avenues to tune the microglial innate immune response in AD pathology.",

The study aimed to investigate the role of cardiovascular burden in the relationship between EDS and dementia incidence over a 12-year follow-up in community-dwelling older adults. We performed analyses on 6171 subjects (aged \u226565\u2009years) free of dementia and vascular disease at baseline. Participants self-reported EDS at baseline and an expert committee validated both prevalent and incident dementia. We defined cardiovascular burden by a low Cardiovascular Health score, constructed using the American Heart Association metrics, and incident vascular events. To explore the potential role of the cardiovascular burden in the relationship between EDS and dementia, we conducted mediation analyses with inverse odds ratio-weighted estimation, using multivariable-adjusted proportional hazard Cox and logistic regression models. Subjects with EDS had a higher risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-1.69) and dementia with vascular component (DVC) (HR 2.14, 95% CI 1.30-3.51), but not Alzheimer's disease (HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.93-1.51). Cardiovascular burden explained 5% (95% CI 4.1-5.2) and 11% (95% CI 9.7-11.3) of the relationship between EDS and all-cause dementia and DVC, respectively.

        "AbstractText": "Although insulin resistance increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the mechanisms remain unclear, partly because no animal model exhibits the insulin-resistant phenotype without persistent hyperglycemia. Here we established an AD model with whole-body insulin resistance without persistent hyperglycemia (APP/IR-dKI mice) by crossbreeding constitutive knock-in mice with P1195L-mutated insulin receptor (IR-KI mice) and those with mutated amyloid precursor protein (AppNL-G-F mice: APP-KI mice). APP/IR-dKI mice exhibited cognitive impairment at an earlier age than APP-KI mice. Since cholinergic dysfunction is a major characteristic of AD, pharmacological interventions on the cholinergic system were performed to investigate the mechanism. Antagonism to a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor \u03b17 (nAChR\u03b17) suppressed cognitive function and cortical blood flow (CBF) response to cholinergic-regulated peripheral stimulation in APP-KI mice but not APP/IR-dKI mice. Cortical expression of Chrna7, encoding nAChR\u03b17, was downregulated in APP/IR-dKI mice compared with APP-KI. Amyloid \u03b2 burden did not differ between APP-KI and APP/IR-dKI mice. Therefore, insulin resistance, not persistent hyperglycemia, induces the earlier onset of cognitive dysfunction and CBF deregulation mediated by nAChR\u03b17 downregulation.

In addition, the gold standard for diagnosing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) remains unclear yet. Neuropsychological testing, such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog), is commonly used tests in identifying AD and MCI, offering convenience, affordability, non-invasiveness, and accessibility in clinical settings. We aimed to accurately evaluate the discriminative ability of the three tests administrated at the same visit simultaneously in detecting AD and MCI due to AD in the absence of a gold standard. A total of 1289 participants aged over 65 were included from the baseline visits of Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Bayesian latent class models, accounting for conditional dependence between MoCA and MMSE, were conducted to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the three tests for detecting AD and MCI. In detecting AD, the ADAS-cog had the highest Youden's Index (0.829), followed by the MoCA(0.813) and MMSE(0.796). The ADAS-cog and MoCA showed similar sensitivity (0.922 vs 0.912) and specificity (0.907 vs 0.901), while the MMSE had lower sensitivity (0.874) and higher specificity (0.922). For MCI detection, the ADAS-cog had the highest Youden's Index (0.704) compared to the MoCA (0.614) and MMSE (0.478). The ADAS-cog exhibited the highest sensitivity, closely followed by the MoCA and MMSE (0.869 vs 0.845 vs 0.757), and the ADAS-cog also had good specificity (0.835 vs 0.769 vs 0.721). The estimated true prevalence of AD among individuals aged over 65 was 20.0%, and the estimated true prevalence of MCI due to AD was 24.8%.

Our results suggest that MNPD are a risk factor for AD related clinical progression in cognitively normal patients seeking medical counseling due to SCD. As such, the assessment of MNPD could be useful for individual clinical prediction and for AD risk stratification in clinical trials.

        "AbstractText": "The loss of excitatory synapses is known to underlie the cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although much is known about the mechanisms underlying synaptic loss in AD, how neurons compensate for this loss and whether this provides cognitive benefits remain almost completely unexplored. In this review, we describe two potential compensatory mechanisms implemented following synaptic loss: the enlargement of the surviving neighboring synapses and the regeneration of synapses. Because dendritic spines, the postsynaptic site of excitatory synapses, are easily visualized using light microscopy, we focus on a range of microscopy approaches to monitor synaptic loss and compensation. Here, we stress the importance of longitudinal dendritic spine imaging, as opposed to fixed-tissue imaging, to gain insights into the temporal dynamics of dendritic spine compensation. We believe that understanding the molecular mechanisms behind these and other forms of synaptic compensation and regeneration will be critical for the development of therapeutics aiming at delaying the onset of cognitive deficits in AD.",

        "AbstractText": "In this study, 50 SD adult male mice were used to create an Alzheimer's disease model. The mice's learning and memory abilities were evaluated using an eight-arm radial maze experiment, and changes in body weight and food intake were noted. This helped to better validate the improvement of Alzheimer's disease caused by pine nut peptide-zinc chelate (Korean pine). For a more thorough investigation, mice's brains were dissected, Endogenous mercaptan antioxidants (enzymes), which are markers of brain tissue, were assessed, and mouse gut flora was analyzed. The findings demonstrated that pine nut peptide-zinc chelate (Korean pine) can improve learning and memory, stop brain aging and damage, and control gut flora in mice. It may exert its effects by ameliorating decreased AChE levels and increased ChAT levels in the central cholinergic system, endogenous thiol antioxidants (enzymes) in the cerebral cortex, and by controlling the bacterial flora in the gut.",

        "AbstractText": "The Kisspeptin1 (KISS1)/neurokinin B (NKB)/Dynorphin (Dyn) [KNDy] neurons in the hypothalamus regulate the reproduction stage in human beings and rodents. KNDy neurons co-expressed all KISS1, NKB, and Dyn peptides, and hence commonly regarded as KISS1 neurons. KNDy neurons contribute to the \"GnRH pulse generator\" and are implicated in the regulation of pulsatile GnRH release. The estradiol (E2)-estrogen receptor (ER) interactions over GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus cause nitric oxide (NO) discharge, in addition to presynaptic GABA and glutamate discharge from respective neurons. The released GABA and glutamate facilitate the activity of GnRH neurons via GABAA-R and AMPA/kainate-R. The KISS1 stimulates MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling and cause the release of Ca2+ from intracellular store, which contribute to neuroendocrine function, increase apoptosis and decrease cell proliferation and metastasis. The ageing in women deteriorates KISS1/KISS1R interaction in the hypothalamus which causes lower levels of GnRH. Because examining the human brain is so challenging, decades of clinical research have failed to find the causes of KNDy/GnRH dysfunction. The KISS1/KISS1R interactions in the brain have a neuroprotective effect against Alzheimer's disease (AD). These findings modulate the pathophysiological role of the KNDy/GnRH neural network in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) associated with ageing and, its protective role in cancer and AD. This review concludes with protecting effect of the steroid-derived acute regulatory enzyme (StAR) against neurotoxicity in the hippocampus, and hypothalamus, and these measures are fundamental for delaying ageing with PCOS. StAR could serve as novel diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for the most prevalent hormone-sensitive breast cancers (BCs).",

        "AbstractText": "Three-component intravoxel incoherent motion (3C-IVIM) imaging with spectral analysis provides a proxy for interstitial fluid (ISF) (e.g., in perivascular spaces (PVS), granting a potential marker for altered cerebral clearance. When 3C-IVIM images are acquired with three orthogonal diffusion-sensitizing directions, these are often averaged into the Trace image. This may result in loss of valuable direction-specific information, particularly in PVS-rich regions (basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale (CSO)). This study assessed the dependence of individual diffusion-sensitizing directions to the ISF fraction in PVS-rich regions. Additionally, we explored the value of diffusion direction-specific information on ISF characteristics in distinguishing thirty-one patients with cognitive impairment (CI) (Alzheimer's disease (n\u00a0=\u00a015) or Mild Cognitive Impairment (n\u00a0=\u00a016)) from thirty cognitively healthy elderly controls (CON). Multi-b-value diffusion-weighted images were acquired in three orthogonal directions (L-R (left-right), A-P (anterior-posterior) and S-I (superior-inferior)) at 3\u00a0T. Voxel-based spectral analysis using non-negative least squares was conducted to independently analyze the L-R, A-P, S-I, and Trace images. 3C-IVIM measures were first compared between diffusion-sensitizing directions and the Trace within the BG using repeated measures ANOVA. Subsequently, the 3C-IVIM measures were compared per direction between the CI and CSO group in the BG and CSO with multivariable linear regression. Our results show that the ISF fraction significantly differs between all diffusion-sensitizing directions and Trace in the BG, with the highest ISF fraction detected using S-I. Solely using S-I, a higher ISF fraction was identified in CI compared to CON in the BG (p\u00a0=\u00a0.020) and CSO (p\u00a0=\u00a0.046). Thereby, this study found that the measured ISF fraction depends on the acquired diffusion-sensitizing direction, where S-I is most sensitive to detect ISF and differences between CI and CON. The Trace approach is not always sensitive enough to ISF characteristics. Solely acquiring S-I may offer an alternative to reduce scanning time.",

        "AbstractText": "Apathy is the most common behavioural and psychological symptom in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases including frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In patients, apathy can include symptoms of loss of motivation, initiative, and interest, listlessness, and indifference, flattening of emotions, absence of drive and passion. Researchers have later refined this to a reduction in goal direct behaviours. In animals, specific symptoms of apathy-like behaviour have been modelled including goal directed or nest-building behaviour which are seen as indicative of proxies for motivation and daily activities. In the present study a nest-building protocol was established using four different inbred mouse strains (CD1, BALB/c, C57Bl/6J, C3H) before assessing AD and FTD tau transgenic mice of Line 1 (L1) and Line 66 (L66) in this paradigm. Female mice aged 5 - 6 months were assessed in the home cage over a period of 7 days with nest-building behaviour scored by three independent experimenters at intervals of 1-, 2- and 7-days post nestlet introduction. Inbred mouse strains displayed different levels of nesting behaviour. BALB/c mice were more proficient than CD1 and C3H mice, while all strains displayed similar nest-building behaviour by day 7. In the tau mouse models, L66 presented with impaired nesting compared to wild-type on days 1 and 2 (not day 7), whereas L1 performed like wild-type on all days. Anhedonia measured in a sucrose preference test was only observed in L66. Anhedonia and low nesting scores in L66 mice are indicative of apathy-like phenotypes. Differences evident between the L1 and L66 tau transgenic mouse models are likely due to the different human tau species expressed in these mice.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease and the common cause of dementia. The aggregation of beta-amyloid (A\u03b2 peptide) leading to excessive neuroinflammation is considered to be the neuropathological hallmark of AD, although the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Oligomerization of these peptides may be associated with their 42 amino acid residue arrangement. However, the process of amyloid plaque formation is still not well known. The protein folding-shape code (PFSC) method is a powerful tool to analyze protein confirmation which could exhibit the local structural folding features in detail. In our study, we utilized the PFSC to analyze A\u03b2 peptide in humans and mice and found that mouse A\u03b242 is less likely to polymerize than human's. Subsequently, we used the PFSC method to analyze the 42 amino acids of A\u03b2, transformed some species in human A\u03b242 and obtained 7 mutants. We showed that it was not easy to aggregate A\u03b2 in mutants. Herein, inflammatory responses were decreased, as indicated by the expression of cytokines. We confirmed that the neurotoxicity of mutant human A\u03b2 was decreased by preventing peptide aggregation. This may represent a new therapeutic approach for treating AD.",

We show that C.\u00a0albicans enters the mouse brain from the blood and induces two neuroimmune sensing mechanisms involving secreted aspartic proteinases (Saps) and candidalysin. Saps disrupt tight junction proteins of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to permit fungal brain invasion. Saps also hydrolyze amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2)-like peptides that bind to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and promote fungal killing in\u00a0vitro while candidalysin engages the integrin CD11b (Mac-1) on microglia. Recognition of A\u03b2-like peptides and candidalysin promotes fungal clearance from the brain, and disruption of candidalysin recognition through CD11b markedly prolongs C.\u00a0albicans cerebral mycosis. Thus, C.\u00a0albicans is cleared from the brain through innate immune mechanisms involving Saps, A\u03b2, candidalysin, and CD11b.",

Adapting promising interventions for other progressive disease conditions may address this need. Few published studies have examined this topic using recognized adaptation frameworks. Objectives: To systematically adapt a nurse-led palliative care intervention for people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and caregivers (A Program of SUPPORT\u2122) for PLWD and caregivers before pilot/feasibility testing. Methods: The Step Framework guided the transformation of A Program of SUPPORT\u2122 to A Program of SUPPORT-D\u2122 (dementia). The Step Framework was modified to include key stakeholder feedback on the initial intervention adaptation using a qualitative approach with semistructured interviews conducted with 5 community support professionals (respite care leaders and staff) and 10 caregivers from the Southeastern United States. A prioritization matrix was created to analyze qualitative feedback and inform intervention refinements. Data were collected between November 2021 and March 2022. Results: The modified Step Framework was a feasible guide for intervention adaptation. Three main themes emerged: organization, terminology, and content. Eight subthemes were identified within the content theme: strategies for providing care, planning ahead, understanding the illness, resources, safety, symptom management, social support, and self-management. Moreover, all participants provided largely positive feedback for the initial adaptation including over 200 suggestions for revision. Majority of participants suggested revising existing adapted content rather than including additional new content. The prioritization matrix was very useful in guiding additional intervention refinements, incorporating suggestions deemed highly important and improving the clarity of SUPPORT-D\u2122. Conclusion: Adapting existing interventions for use by PLWD and caregivers is a practical approach that can increase the speed of translation of applicable and effective interventions used in other populations. Early feedback, prioritized using a matrix, helped further refine the initial adaptation.",

However, previous studies have focused on 1-person homes only, which limits their generalizability. This study aimed to compare the life space activity patterns of participants living alone with those of participants living as a couple and to compare people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with cognitively normal participants in both 1- and 2-person homes. Passive infrared motion sensors and door contact sensors were installed in 1- and 2-person homes with cognitively normal residents or residents with MCI. A home was classified as an MCI home if at least 1 person in the home had MCI. Time out of home (TOOH), independent life space activity (ILSA), and use of the living room, kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom were calculated. Data were analyzed using the following methods: (1) daily averages over 4 weeks, (2) hourly averages (time of day) over 4 weeks, or (3) longitudinal day-to-day changes. In total, 129 homes with people living alone (n=27, 20.9%, MCI and n=102, 79.1%, no-MCI homes) and 52 homes with people living as a couple (n=24, 46.2%, MCI and n=28, 53.8%, no-MCI homes) were included with a mean follow-up of 719 (SD 308) days. Using all 3 analysis methods, we found that 2-person homes showed a shorter TOOH, a longer ILSA, and shorter living room and kitchen use. In MCI homes, ILSA was higher in 2-person homes but lower in 1-person homes. The effects of MCI status on other outcomes were only found when using the hourly averages or longitudinal day-to-day changes over time, and they depended on the household type (alone vs residing as a couple). This study shows that in-home behavior is different when a participant is living alone compared to when they are living as a couple, meaning that the household type should be considered when studying in-home behavior. The effects of MCI status can be detected with in-home sensors, even in 2-person homes, but data should be analyzed on an hour-to-hour basis or longitudinally.",

The binding potentials between the core targets and herbicides were validated by molecular docking and molecular dynamics. A total of 1,062 DEGs were screened between the AD patients and controls, which identified 148 intersectional targets of herbicides causing AD that were screened by network pharmacology analysis. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that cell cycling and cellular senescence were important signalling pathways. Finally, the core targets EGFR, FN1, and TYMS were screened and validated by molecular docking and molecular dynamics.

In this study, we examined the effect of the NLPE on neurogenesis and the mechanisms underlying Q3GA on neurogenesis. We fed 24-week-old male C57BL/6 mice with 0.1 or 0.25% NLPE for 2 weeks. NLPE treatment increased small spindle-shaped stem cell numbers in the subgranular zone and the number of doublecortin (DCX)- and neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN)-expressing neurons. HT22, a hippocampal cell line, treated with Q3GA revealed significant neurite growth and upregulated TrkR and PI3K/Akt levels. The evidence from a model of retinoic acid-induced SH-SY5Y cell differentiation showed that Q3GA or NLPE increases neurite growth significantly.

However, despite its importance, very few studies in this area have examined whether older adults produce spontaneous speech with characteristics that are sufficiently consistent to be used as proxy markers of cognitive status. This preliminary study seeks to investigate consistency across lexical characteristics of speech in older adults with and without cognitive impairment. A total of 39 older adults from a larger, ongoing study (age: mean 81.1, SD 5.9 years) were included. Participants completed neuropsychological testing and both picture description tasks and expository tasks to elicit speech. Participants with T-scores of \u226440 on \u22652 cognitive tests were categorized as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Speech features were computed automatically by using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit. Reliability indices based on mean correlations for picture description tasks and expository tasks were similar in persons with and without MCI (with r ranging from 0.49 to 0.65 within tasks). Intraindividual variability was generally preserved across lexical speech features. Speech rate and filler rate were the most consistent indices for the cognitively intact group, and speech rate was the most consistent for the MCI group. Our findings suggest that automatically calculated lexical properties of speech are consistent in older adults with varying levels of cognitive impairment.

AD manifests by two pathological hallmarks: extracellular amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide-containing senile plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles comprised of aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-tau). However, more than half of AD cases also display the presence of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn)-containing Lewy bodies. Conversely, Lewy bodies disorders have been reported to have concomitant A\u03b2 plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Our drug discovery program focuses on the synthesis of multitarget-directed ligands to abrogate aberrant \u03b1-syn, tau (2N4R), and p-tau (1N4R) aggregation and to slow the progression of AD and related dementias. To this end, we synthesized 11 compounds with a triazine-linker and evaluated their effectiveness in reducing \u03b1-syn, tau isoform 2N4R, and p-tau isoform 1N4R aggregation. We utilized biophysical methods such as thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assays, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoinduced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP), and M17D intracellular inclusion cell-based assays to evaluate the antiaggregation properties and cellular protection of our best compounds. We also performed disaggregation assays with isolated A\u03b2-plaques from human AD brains. Our results demonstrated that compound 10 was effective in reducing both oligomerization and fibril formation of \u03b1-syn and tau isoform 2N4R in a dose-dependent manner via ThT and PICUP assays.

AD has been attributed to the aggregations of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides which result in the formation of plaques that block the neuron-transferring process done by the brain memory cells. These plaques are formed upon cleavage of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by Gamma-Secretase (GS). GS protein has around 141 substrates, the important two are APP and Notch. Considering one of the hot spots in AD research, we focused on GS and its relation to AD. Moreover, a lot of research was done on beta-secretase and drugs were developed to target it however, few drugs are established for GS. GS contains four subunits: Presenilin (PS), PEN-2, Nicastrin, and APH-1. The catalytic subunit is PS, which contains the active site for substrate binding, as well as the allosteric and docking sites. Both PEN-2 and APH-1 are regulators for the stability and activity of GS. Nicastrin, helps the substrates bind to the PS. Additionally, the role of the immuno-protein named \"IFITM3\" and how it affects the immune system and its relation to AD is presented. GS is one of the most studied proteins with many developed candidates as inhibitors (GSI) and modulators (GSM).

Fractalkine is expressed by neurons as a membrane-bound protein (mCX3CL1) that can be cleaved by extracellular proteases generating several sCX3CL1 forms. sCX3CL1, containing the chemokine domain, and mCX3CL1 have high affinity by their unique receptor (CX3CR1) which, physiologically, is only found in microglia, a resident immune cell of the CNS. The activation of CX3CR1contributes to survival and maturation of the neural network during development, glutamatergic synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, cognition, neuropathic pain, and inflammatory regulation in the adult brain. Indeed, the various CX3CL1 forms appear in some cases to serve an anti-inflammatory role of microglia, whereas in others, they have a pro-inflammatory role, aggravating neurological disorders. In the last decade, evidence points to the fact that sCX3CL1 and mCX3CL1 exhibit selective and differential effects on their targets. Thus, the balance in their level and activity will impact on neuron-microglia interaction. This review is focused on the description of factors determining the emergence of distinct fractalkine forms, their age-dependent changes, and how they contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. Changes in the balance among various fractalkine forms may be one of the mechanisms on which converge aging, chronic CNS inflammation, and neurodegeneration.",

At baseline (n = 7080), logistic regression was used to examine the association between hearing status (predictor) and the presence of global and domain-specific MBI (outcome), adjusting for age, sex, cognitive diagnosis, and apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4). Cox proportional hazard models with time-dependent covariates were used to examine the effect of (1) hearing status as exposure on the rate of incident MBI (n = 5889); and (2) MBI as exposure on the rate of incident HL in those with no HL at baseline (n = 6252). Cross-sectionally, participants with Untreated-HL were more likely to exhibit global MBI (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.24-2.21) and individual MBI domains of social inappropriateness (aOR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.06-3.39), affective dysregulation (aOR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.21-2.38), and impulse dyscontrol (aOR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.21-2.38), compared to those with No-HL. Participants with Treated-HL (i.e., hearing aid use) did not differ from No-HL for odds of global or most MBI domains, except for impulse dyscontrol (aOR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.05-1.81). Longitudinally, we found relationships between Treated-HL and incident MBI (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.01-1.63) and between MBI and incident Untreated-HL (aHR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.19-1.94). Our cross-sectional results support that hearing aid use is associated with lower odds of concurrent global MBI in dementia-free participants. Longitudinally, relationships were found between MBI and HL. The severity of HL was not assessed, however, and may require further exploration. Hearing Loss (HL) and mild behavioral impairment (MBI) are markers of dementiaCross-sectionally: Untreated-HL was associated with global MBI burden, butHL treated with hearing aids was notWe found associations between MBI and incident Untreated-HL.",

It is necessary to search for reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD in a timely and effective manner in high-risk or preclinical AD populations. Studies have shown that neurogenic exosomes in the blood can be effectively used as biomarkers for AD. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to find reliable biomarkers (A\u03b242, T-tau, and P-tau181 in peripheral blood neurogenic exosomes) for the early diagnosis of AD to provide theoretical support for the early diagnosis of high-risk or preclinical AD populations. By searching the literature database, relevant studies on AD diagnostic markers were collected. The study period was from April 1, 2012, to April 1, 2022. The average concentrations of A\u03b242, T-tau, and P-tau181 in the exosomes of the AD group and healthy control group were compared using RevMan 5.3 software. A total of 13 studies were screened, including 842 subjects. Meta-analysis showed that the combined SMD value of neurogenic exosome A\u03b242 was 1.70 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[1.20,2.20], Z\u00a0=\u00a06.69, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Typically, these complex processes are studied using liposomes as model membranes-either by encapsulating a fluorescent dye or by other spectroscopic approaches, such as nuclear magnetic resonance. Despite incorporating physiologically relevant lipids, no synthetic model truly recapitulates the full complexity and molecular diversity of the plasma membrane. Here, biologically representative membrane models, giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs), are prepared from eukaryotic cells by inducing a budding event with a chemical stressor. The GPMVs are then isolated, and bilayers are labelled with fluorescent lipophilic tracers and incubated in a microplate with a membrane-active peptide. As the membranes become damaged and/or aggregate, the resulting fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the two tracers increases and is measured periodically in a microplate. This approach offers a particularly useful way to detect perturbations when the membrane complexity is an important variable to consider. Additionally, it provides a way to kinetically detect damage to the plasma membrane, which can be correlated with the kinetics of peptide self-assembly or structural rearrangements. Key features \u2022 Allows testing of various peptide-membrane interaction conditions (peptide:phospholipid ratio, ionic strength, buffer, etc.) at once. \u2022 Uses intact plasma membrane vesicles that can be prepared from a variety of cell lines. \u2022 Can offer comparable throughput as with traditional synthetic lipid models (e.g., dye-encapsulated liposomes).",

Case-control studies reporting on periodontal disease and dementia parameters were selected based on PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes) framework. A Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality reporting of the studies and PRISMA guideline was used for screening. A total of ten studies were identified for analysis. Most studies reported higher plaque index score (PI), bleeding on probing (BoP), pocket depth (PD) and clinical attachment loss (CAL) among individuals diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer's disease compared with clinically healthy controls or individual diagnosed without dementia. A higher prevalence of subjects with severe periodontal disease was also observed in individuals diagnosed with dementia/Alzheimer's disease. The quality of the studies was found to be moderate with lower comparability and ascertainment criteria scores. This qualitative analysis has shown poor periodontal health and increased inflammatory mediators in case groups compared to the control groups.

Calebin-A occurs naturally in trace quantities in Curcuma longa/C cassia, commonly known as turmeric, from the Zingiberaceae family. Calebin-A is a curcumin analog or 'chemical cousin' of curcumin with a similar chemical structure. Although few research studies have been conducted on the pharmacological and therapeutic properties of calebin-A, it is a very promising molecule with a variety of pharmacological properties. Some studies have suggested that calebin-A is helpful in treating various cancers due to its inhibitory effect on cell growth and anti-inflammatory properties. Other studies have suggested that calebin-A may improve neurocognitive status associated with neurodegeneration caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD) by inhibiting the aggregation of \u03b2-amyloid. Finally, several studies have proposed that calebin-A may potentially be therapeutically beneficial in treating patients with obesity. This novel compound downregulates nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB-mediated processes involved with cancer, such as tumor cell invasion, proliferation, metastasis, and, most profoundly, inflammation. Moreover, calebin-A influences the activities of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in cancer cells.

        "AbstractText": "The insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is an evolutionarily conserved zinc-dependent metallopeptidase highly expressed in the brain, where its specific functions remain poorly understood. Besides insulin, IDE is able to cleave many substrates in vitro, including amyloid beta peptides, making this enzyme a candidate pathophysiological link between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). These antecedents led us to address the impact of IDE absence in hippocampus and olfactory bulb. A specific induction of microgliosis was found in the hippocampus of IDE knockout (IDE-KO) mice, without any effects in neither hippocampal volume nor astrogliosis. Performance on hippocampal-dependent memory tests is influenced by IDE gene dose in 12-month-old mice. Furthermore, a comprehensive characterization of the impact of IDE haploinsufficiency and total deletion in metabolic, behavioral, and molecular parameters in the olfactory bulb, a site of high insulin receptor levels, reveals an unambiguous barcode for IDE-KO mice at that age. Using wildtype and IDE-KO primary microglial cultures, we performed a functional analysis at the cellular level. IDE absence alters microglial responses to environmental signals, resulting in impaired modulation of phenotypic states, with only transitory effects on amyloid-\u03b2 management. Collectively, our results reveal previously unknown physiological functions for IDE in microglia that, due to cell-compartment topological reasons, cannot be explained by its enzymatic activity, but instead modulate their multidimensional response to various damaging conditions relevant to aging and AD conditions.",

Previously, we showed that cognitively healthy older individuals whose cerebrospinal fluid amyloid/tau ratio indicates high risk of cognitive decline experienced implicit interference during a high-effort task, signaling early changes in attention. To further investigate attention's effect on implicit interference, we analyzed two experiments completed sequentially by the same high- and low-risk individuals. We hypothesized that if attention modulates interference, practice would affect the influence of implicit distractors. Indeed, while both groups experienced a strong practice effect, the association between practice and interference effects diverged between groups: stronger practice effects correlated with more implicit interference in high-risk participants, but less interference in low-risk individuals. Furthermore, low-risk individuals showed a positive correlation between implicit interference and EEG low-range alpha event-related desynchronization when switching from high- to low-load tasks. This suggests that lower attention on the task was correlated with stronger interference, a typical phenomenon in the younger population. These results demonstrate how attention impacts implicit interference and highlight early differences in perception between high- and low-risk individuals.",

Among them, A\u03b242 peptides tend to aggregate and create oligomers and plaques. Macroautophagy, a form of autophagy characterized by a double-membrane vesicle, plays a crucial role in maintaining neuronal homeostasis by degrading protein aggregates and dysfunctional organelles as a quality control process. Recently, DEF8, a relatively uncharacterized protein, has been proposed as a participant in vesicular traffic and autophagy pathways. We have reported increased DEF8 levels in lymphocytes from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early-stage AD patients and a neuronal profile in a murine transgenic AD model. Here, we analyzed DEF8 localization and levels in the postmortem frontal cortex of AD patients, finding increased levels compared to healthy controls. To evaluate the potential function of DEF8 in the nervous system, we performed an in silico assessment of its expression and network profiles, followed by an in vivo evaluation of a neuronal Def8 deficient model using a Drosophila melanogaster model of AD based on A\u03b242 expression. Our findings show that DEF8 is an essential protein for maintaining cellular homeostasis in the nervous system, and it is upregulated under stress conditions generated by A\u03b242 aggregation.

An exploratory comparative case study research design was conducted. Three cases correspond of dyads of a caregiver, a person with mild to moderate dementia, and either a neuro service dog (NSD), a companion dog or no dog. Hypotheses are formulated to capture differences between cases. Recruitment was done in a service dog organisation, through Canadian Alzheimer associations and in records of a hospital. Data were collected through 45-60\u00a0minutes telephone interviews that included completion of the Caregiver's Burden Scale and sociodemographic questions. We used an inductive approach with qualitative data. There were five caregivers (mean age 54.8\u00a0years) who had an NSD, 28 caregivers (63.6\u00a0years) who had a companion dog, and 23 caregivers (63.8\u00a0years) without dog.

For dyads with companion dog and without dog, 'Engagement-and-meaning of life' as well as 'Physical activity with the dog' were the most discussed roles. The 'Sleep or wake up' role was the least discussed role across three cases. In the other categories, they were seven advantages and 10 inconvenients that were mentioned for canine assistance. For home care support, the presence of NSD has more positive impacts on both the person with dementia and their caregiver compared to the presence of a companion dog; the presence of a NSD results in the person with dementia accessing more indoor and outdoor public sites than with a companion dog; and dyads with a dog are informally socially engaged more frequently than those with no dog.",

Presenilin (PS) is the catalytic subunit of the \u03b3-secretase complex, which cleaves type I transmembrane proteins, such as Notch and the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and plays an evolutionarily conserved role in the protection of neuronal survival during aging. FAD PSEN1 mutations exhibit impaired \u03b3-secretase activity in cell culture, in vitro, and knockin (KI) mouse brains, and the L435F mutation is the most severe in reducing \u03b3-secretase activity and is located closest to the active site of \u03b3-secretase. Here, we report that introduction of the codon-optimized wild-type human PSEN1 cDNA by adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) results in broadly distributed, sustained, low to moderate levels of human PS1 (hPS1) expression and rescues impaired \u03b3-secretase activity in the cerebral cortex of Psen mutant mice either lacking PS or expressing the Psen1 L435F KI allele, as evaluated by endogenous \u03b3-secretase substrates of APP and recombinant \u03b3-secretase products of Notch intracellular domain and A\u03b2 peptides. Furthermore, introduction of hPS1 by AAV9 alleviates impairments of synaptic plasticity and learning and memory in Psen mutant mice. Importantly, AAV9 delivery of hPS1 ameliorates neurodegeneration in the cerebral cortex of aged Psen mutant mice, as shown by the reversal of age-dependent loss of cortical neurons and elevated microgliosis and astrogliosis. These results together show that moderate hPS1 expression by AAV9 is sufficient to rescue impaired \u03b3-secretase activity, synaptic and memory deficits, and neurodegeneration caused by Psen mutations in mouse models.",

Currently, approved treatments for AD are hindered by various side effects and limited efficacy. Despite considerable research, practical treatments for AD have not been developed. Increasing evidence shows that glial cells, especially microglia and astrocytes, are essential in the initiation and progression of AD. During AD progression, activated resident microglia increases the ability of resting astrocytes to transform into reactive astrocytes, promoting neurodegeneration. Extensive clinical and molecular studies show the involvement of microglia and astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation in AD pathology, indicating that microglia and astrocytes may be potential therapeutic targets for AD. This review will summarize the significant and recent advances of microglia and astrocytes in the pathogenesis of AD in three parts. First, we will review the typical pathological changes of AD and discuss microglia and astrocytes in terms of function and phenotypic changes. Second, we will describe microglia and astrocytes' physiological and pathological role in AD. These roles include the inflammatory response, \"eat me\" and \"don't eat me\" signals, A\u03b2 seeding, propagation, clearance, synapse loss, synaptic pruning, remyelination, and demyelination. Last, we will review the pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies targeting microglia and astrocytes in AD. We conclude that microglia and astrocytes are essential in the initiation and development of AD. Therefore, understanding the new role of microglia and astrocytes in AD progression is critical for future AD studies and clinical trials. Moreover, pharmacological, and non-pharmacological therapies targeting microglia and astrocytes, with specific studies investigating microglia and astrocyte-mediated neuronal damage and repair, may be a promising research direction for future studies regarding AD treatment and prevention.",

Our results indicate that histopathologic brain age is a powerful, independent metric for understanding factors that contribute to brain aging.",

        "AbstractText": "Background PET can be used for amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration (ATN) classification in Alzheimer disease, but incurs considerable cost and exposure to ionizing radiation. MRI currently has limited use in characterizing ATN status. Deep learning techniques can detect complex patterns in MRI data and have potential for noninvasive characterization of ATN status. Purpose To use deep learning to predict PET-determined ATN biomarker status using MRI and readily available diagnostic data. Materials and Methods MRI and PET data were retrospectively collected from the Alzheimer's Disease Imaging Initiative. PET scans were paired with MRI scans acquired within 30 days, from August 2005 to September 2020. Pairs were randomly split into subsets as follows: 70% for training, 10% for validation, and 20% for final testing. A bimodal Gaussian mixture model was used to threshold PET scans into positive and negative labels. MRI data were fed into a convolutional neural network to generate imaging features. These features were combined in a logistic regression model with patient demographics, APOE gene status, cognitive scores, hippocampal volumes, and clinical diagnoses to classify each ATN biomarker component as positive or negative. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis was used for model evaluation. Feature importance was derived from model coefficients and gradients. Results There were 2099 amyloid (mean patient age, 75 years \u00b1 10 [SD]; 1110 male), 557 tau (mean patient age, 75 years \u00b1 7; 280 male), and 2768 FDG PET (mean patient age, 75 years \u00b1 7; 1645 male) and MRI pairs. Model AUCs for the test set were as follows: amyloid, 0.79 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.83); tau, 0.73 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.86); and neurodegeneration, 0.86 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.89). Within the networks, high gradients were present in key temporal, parietal, frontal, and occipital cortical regions. Model coefficients for cognitive scores, hippocampal volumes, and APOE status were highest. Conclusion A deep learning algorithm predicted each component of PET-determined ATN status with acceptable to excellent efficacy using MRI and other available diagnostic data. \u00a9 RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

        "AbstractText": "Cannabis has shown promise in treating various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Current treatments for AD are limited and are not very effective. This study investigated the enzyme-ligand relationship between nine active components of cannabis and human acetylcholinesterase (HuAChE) enzyme, which is significant in AD. Specifically, computational methods such as quantum mechanics, molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and free energy calculations were used to identify the cannabis phytochemicals with the highest HuAChE affinity and to understand the specific binding mechanisms involved. Our results showed that cannabichromene and cannabigerol were the cannabis phytochemicals with the highest affinity for HuAChE, with cannabichromene exhibiting the greatest binding energy. However, both substances showed lower affinity than that of the pharmaceutical drug donepezil. This study suggests that cannabichromene has a specific affinity for the peripheral anionic site (PAS) and acyl-binding pocket (ABP), while cannabigerol predominantly binds to PAS. Also, it was found that cannabichromene has a specific affinity for PAS and ABP, while cannabigerol predominantly binds to PAS. Our findings suggest that cannabichromene and cannabigerol are potential therapeutic agents, but further research is needed to validate their effectiveness. The specific binding mechanisms identified may also provide helpful information for the design of more effective cannabis-based drugs. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the potential of cannabis-based drugs for treating neurological diseases.",

The symptoms of Parkinson's are classified as motor symptoms and non-motor symptoms. Motor symptoms involve rigidity, tremors, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Non-motor symptoms consist of cognitive dysfunction, salivation, lacrimation, etc. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to find out the most recent treatment options for Parkinson's disease. Research and review papers are collected from different databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, Mendeley, Scopus, Science Open, and the Directory of Open Access Journals using different keywords such as \"Parkinson's disease, biomarkers, animal models\". Currently, various novel therapeutics have been emerging for PD. These may include treatments that may control the symptoms without causing any other severe side effects with already available treatments. Better therapies such as gene therapies, cell-based treatments, and regenerative therapies, which may evolve over time, can be a better therapeutic option. There is a need for the development of novel and potential therapeutic strategies that offer fewer side effects to patients. Several clinical, biochemical, and imaging markers that are noteworthy in Parkinson's disease examination have been discussed here. Current work in the field of Parkinson's disease has developed a variety of significant small animal models, such as viral vector models and seeding models, including the insertion of preformed fibrils of alpha-synuclein. The brief concepts regarding risk factors, pathogenesis, clinical diagnosis, and emerging treatments of PD are discussed in this review article.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the highly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder of the aging brain and is allied with cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. Unfortunately, there is very limited drug discovery for the effective management of AD, and the clinically approved drugs have limited efficacy. Consequently, there is an immediate demand for the development of new compounds that have the ability to act as multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs). As major pathological targets of the disease, the current study aimed to investigate lead natural bioactive compounds including apigenin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, berberine, curcumin, genistein, luteolin, quercetin, resveratrol for their inhibitory potentials against \u03b2-amyloid cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) and monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) enzymes. The study compounds were docked against the target enzymes (MAO-B and BACE1) using MOE software and subsequent molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) studies. The molecular docking analysis revealed that these phytochemicals (MTDLs) showed good interactions with the target enzymes as compared to the reference inhibitors. Among these eight phytocompounds, the epigallocatechin-3-gallate compound was an active inhibitor against both drug targets, with the highest docking scores and good interactions with the active residues of the enzymes. Furthermore, the docking result of the active one inhibitor in complex with the target enzymes (epigallocatechin-3-gallate/BACE1, epigallocatechin-3-gallate/MAO-B, reference/BACE1 and reference/MAO-B) were further validated by MDS. According to the findings of our study, epigallocatechin-3-gallate has the potential to be a candidate for use in the treatment of neurological illnesses like AD. This compound has MTDL potential and may be exploited to create new compounds with disease-modifying features.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

        "AbstractText": "At the interface between genes and environment, epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone modification, regulate neurogenic processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and maturation of neural stem cells. However, these mechanisms are altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative condition that mainly affects older adults. Since epigenetic mechanisms are known to be reversible, a number of molecules from natural sources are being studied as epigenetic regulators in AD. Recently, in\u00a0vitro and in silico studies have shown that C. subedentata and its alkaloids modulated neurotoxicity. However, studies exploring the epigenetic activity of these alkaloids are limited. We conducted a set of bioassays to evaluate neuronal differentiation and the sensitivity of undifferentiated SH-SY5 cells against a neurotoxic stimulus. In addition, we analyzed the methylation profiles in genes such as APP, PSI, and BACE1 due to their role in amyloid processing. Docking and molecular dynamic analysis were used to explore the effect exerted by C. subedentata alkaloids on the regulation of histone deacetylases (HDAC2, HDAC3 and HDAC7). The results demonstrated that C. subedentata and galantamine induce neuronal differentiation and protect the undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells against A\u03b2(1-42)-induced neurotoxicity. The methylation profiles of the studied genes show no statistically significant differences between C. subedentata, galantamine. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution, since small changes in methylation promoters in the brain could not be easily detected. Results from in silico approaches describe for the first time the potential promissing epigenetic effects of galantamine by regulating HDAC3 and HDAC7 modification.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

This represents a potential risk for inter-individual prion infection. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the presence of prions in urine of patients suffering from the major subtypes of sCJD. Urine samples from sCJD patients spanning the six major subtypes were tested. As controls, we used urine samples from people affected by other neurological or neurodegenerative diseases as well as healthy controls. These samples were analyzed blinded. The presence of prions was detected by a modified version of the PMCA technology, specifically optimized for high sensitive detection of sCJD prions. The PMCA assay was first optimized to detect low quantities of prions in diluted brain homogenates from patients affected by all subtypes of sCJD spiked into healthy urine. Twenty-nine of the 81 patients affected by sCJD analyzed in this study were positive by PMCA testing, whereas none of the 160 controls showed any signal. These results indicate a 36% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The subtypes with the highest positivity rate were VV1 and VV2, which combined account for about 15-20% of all sCJD cases, and no detection was observed in MV1 and MM2. Our findings indicate that potentially infectious prions are secreted in urine of some sCJD patients, suggesting a possible risk for inter-individual transmission. Prion detection in urine might be used as a noninvasive preliminary screening test to detect sCJD.",

        "AbstractText": "Aging, tau pathology, and chronic inflammation in the brain play crucial roles in synaptic loss, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline in tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease. Senescent cells accumulate in the aging brain, accelerate the aging process, and promote tauopathy progression through their abnormal inflammatory secretome known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Tau oligomers (TauO)-the most neurotoxic tau species-are known to induce senescence and the SASP, which subsequently promote neuropathology, inflammation, oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction, neuronal death, and cognitive dysfunction. TauO, brain inflammation, and senescence are associated with heterogeneity in tauopathy progression and cognitive decline. However, the underlying mechanisms driving the disease heterogeneity remain largely unknown, impeding the development of therapies for tauopathies. Based on clinical and preclinical evidence, this review highlights the critical role of TauO and senescence in neurodegeneration. We discuss key knowledge gaps and potential strategies for targeting senescence and TauO to treat tauopathies.

This study examined within-network connectivity of cingulo-opercular (CON), frontoparietal control (FPCN), and default mode (DMN) networks, and verbal and visuospatial learning and memory in older adults. Across domains, we hypothesized that greater CON and FPCN connectivity would associate with better learning, and greater DMN connectivity would associate with better memory. A total of 330 healthy older adults (age range = 65-89) underwent resting-state fMRI and completed the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R) in a randomized clinical trial. Total and delayed recall scores were assessed from baseline data, and a learning ratio calculation was applied to participants' scores. Average CON, FPCN, and DMN connectivity values were obtained with CONN Toolbox. Hierarchical regressions controlled for sex, race, ethnicity, years of education, and scanner site, as this was a multi-site study. Greater within-network CON connectivity was associated with better verbal learning (HVLT-R Total Recall, Learning Ratio), visuospatial learning (BVMT-R Total Recall), and visuospatial memory (BVMT-R Delayed Recall). Greater FPCN connectivity was associated with better visuospatial learning (BVMT-R Learning Ratio) but did not survive multiple comparison correction. DMN connectivity was not associated with these measures of learning and memory. CON may make small but unique contributions to learning and memory across domains, making it a valuable target in future longitudinal studies and interventions to attenuate memory decline.

One of the limitations in studying AD is the lack of animal models that show features of Alzheimer's pathogenesis. The tree shrew has a much closer genetic affinity to primates than to rodents and has great potential to be used for research into aging and AD. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether tree shrews naturally develop cognitive impairment and major AD-like pathologies with increasing age. Pole-board and novel object recognition tests were used to assess the cognitive performance of adult (about 1 year old) and aged (6 years old or older) tree shrews. The main AD-like pathologies were assessed by Western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, immunofluorescence staining, and Nissl staining. Our results showed that the aged tree shrews developed an impaired cognitive performance compared to the adult tree shrews. Moreover, the aged tree shrews exhibited several age-related phenotypes that are associated with AD, including increased levels of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation and phosphorylated tau protein, synaptic and neuronal loss, and reactive gliosis in the cortex and the hippocampal tissues.

Various studies have explored changes in either the regional activity or the interregional connectivity underlying the aging process of WM. We proposed that brain activity and connectivity would independently alter with aging and affect WM performance. WM was assessed with a classical N-back task during functional magnetic resonance imaging in a community-based sample comprising 168 elderly subjects (aged 55-86\u2009years old). Following the rationale of background functional connectivity, we assessed age-related alterations in brain activity and seed-based interregional connectivity independently. Analyses revealed age-related decrease in positive activity of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and an increase in the negative activity of the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the local functional dysfunctions were accompanied by alterations in their connectivity to other cortical regions. Importantly, regional activity impairments in the IPL and ACC could mediate age-related effects on accuracy rate and reaction time, respectively, and those effects were further counterbalanced by enhancement of their background functional connectivity. We thus claimed that age-induced alterations in regional activity and interregional connectivity occurred independently and contributed to WM changes in aging. Our findings presented the way brain activity and functional connectivity interact in the late adulthood, thus providing a new perspective for understanding WM and cognitive aging.",

The genetic traits of MCI patients who experience a rapid progression to AD can enhance early diagnosis capabilities and facilitate drug discovery for AD. While a genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a standard tool for identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to a disease, it fails to detect SNPs with small effect sizes due to stringent control for multiple testing. Additionally, the method does not consider the group structures of SNPs, such as genes or linkage disequilibrium blocks, which can provide valuable insights into the genetic architecture. To address the limitations, we propose a Bayesian bi-level variable selection method that detects SNPs associated with time of conversion from MCI to AD. Our approach integrates group inclusion indicators into an accelerated failure time model to identify important SNP groups. Additionally, we employ data augmentation techniques to impute censored time values using a predictive posterior. We adapt Dirichlet-Laplace shrinkage priors to incorporate the group structure for SNP-level variable selection. In the simulation study, our method outperformed other competing methods regarding variable selection.

We examined 138 participants on the AD spectrum (15 with preclinical AD, 62 with prodromal AD, and 61 with AD dementia; mean age 73.4 \u00b1 8.0 years; female 58.7%). Total sleep time was longer in the AD dementia group (7.4 \u00b1 1.6 hours) compared to the preclinical (6.5 \u00b1 1.4 hours; p = 0.026) and prodromal groups (6.6 \u00b1 1.4 hours; p = 0.001), while other sleep parameters did not differ between groups. Longer total sleep time was not associated with amyloid accumulation but rather with tau accumulation, especially in the amygdala, hippocampus, basal forebrain, insular, cingulate, occipital, inferior temporal cortices, and precuneus. Longer total sleep time predicted faster tau accumulation in Braak regions V-VI (\u03b2 = 0.016, p = 0.007) and disease progression to mild cognitive impairment or dementia (hazard ratio = 1.554, p = 0.024).

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with an impairment of cognition and memory. Current research on connectomics have now related changes in the network organization in AD to the patterns of accumulation and spread of amyloid and tau, providing insights into the neurobiological mechanisms of the disease. In addition, network analysis and modeling focus on particular use of graphs to provide intuition into key organizational principles of brain structure, that stipulate how neural activity propagates along structural connections. The utility of connectome-based computational models aids in early predicting, tracking the progression of biomarker-directed AD neuropathology. In this article, we present a short review of tau trajectory, the connectome changes in tau pathology, and the dependent recent connectome-based computational modelling approaches for tau spreading, reproducing pragmatic findings, and developing significant novel tau targeted therapies.",

In this study, we have explored the hypothesis that an age-related imbalance in brain RAS is a trigger for RAS dysregulation in AD. We characterised RAS gene expression in the frontal cortex from (i) a cohort of normal ageing (n = 99, age range = 19-96 y) and (ii) a case-control cohort (n = 209) including AD (n = 66), mixed dementia (VaD + AD) (n = 50), pure vascular dementia (VaD) (n = 42), and age-matched controls (n = 51). The AD, mixed dementia, and age-matched controls were further stratified by Braak tangle stage (BS): BS0-II (n = 48), BSIII-IV (n = 44) and BSV-VI (n = 85). Gene expression (qPCR) was calculated for ACE1, AGTR1, AGTR2, ACE2, LNPEP, and MAS1 using the 2-\u2206\u2206Cq method, after adjustment for reference genes (RPL13 and UBE2D2) and cell-specific calibrator genes (NEUN, GFAP, PECAM). ACE1 and AGTR1 gene expression, markers of classical RAS signalling, and AGTR2 gene expression were elevated in normal ageing but markers of protective downstream regulatory RAS (rRAS) signalling, including ACE2, MAS1, and LNPEP were unchanged. In AD and mixed dementia, AGTR1 and AGTR2 gene expression were elevated in BSIII-IV and BSV-VI respectively. MAS1 gene expression was reduced at BSV-VI and was inversely related to parenchymal A\u03b2 and tau load. LNPEP gene expression was specifically elevated in VaD. These data provide novel insights into RAS signalling in normal ageing and dementia.",

        "AbstractText": "An early substantial loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) is a common property of Alzheimer's disease and the degeneration of functional BFCNs is related to learning and memory deficits. As a biocompatible and conductive scaffold for growth of neural stem cells, three-dimensional graphene foam (3D-GF) supports applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Although its effects on differentiation have been demonstrated, the effect of 3D-GF scaffold on the generation of BFCNs still remains unknown. In this study, we used 3D-GF as a culture substrate for neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and demonstrated that this scaffold material promotes the differentiation of BFCNs while maintaining excellent cell viability and proliferation. Immunofluorescence analysis, RT-PCR, western blotting and ELISA revealed that the proportion of BFCNs at 21 days of differentiation reached approximately 30.5% on 3D-GF compared with TCPS group that only presented 9.7%. Furthermore, a cell adhesion study suggested that 3D-GF scaffold enhances the expression of adhesion proteins including vinculin, integrin and N-cadherin. These findings indicate that 3D-GF scaffold materials are preferable candidates for the differentiation of BFCNs from NPCs. These results suggest new opportunities for the application of 3D-GF scaffold as a neural scaffold for cholinergic neurons therapies based on NPCs.",

        "AbstractText": "Voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv) are tetrameric membrane proteins that provide a highly selective pathway for potassium ions (K+) to diffuse across a hydrophobic cell membrane. These unique voltage-gated cation channels detect changes in membrane potential and, upon activation, help to return the depolarized cell to a resting state during the repolarization stage of each action potential. The Kv3 family of potassium channels is characterized by a high activation potential and rapid kinetics, which play a crucial role for the fast-spiking neuronal phenotype. Mutations in the Kv3.1 channel have been shown to have implications in various neurological diseases like epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, disruptions in neuronal circuitry involving Kv3.1 have been correlated with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Here, we report the discovery of a novel positive modulator of Kv3.1, investigate its biophysical properties, and determine the cryo-EM structure of the compound in complex with Kv3.1. Structural analysis reveals the molecular determinants of positive modulation in Kv3.1 channels by this class of compounds and provides additional opportunities for rational drug design for the treatment of associated neurological disorders.",

        "AbstractText": "Infection with merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is implicated in the development of merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare but aggressive skin cancer. MCC has a mortality rate near 50%, and incidence has been rapidly increasing in recent decades, making development of improved treatment strategies critical to addressing its growing social burden. The parallel increasing necessity for novel research to better understand MCPyV pathogenesis has prompted numerous studies in recent years, yet the role of intrinsic disorder in MCPyV proteins remains unexplored. This study carries out computational characterization of intrinsic disorder within the MCPyV proteome and suggests mechanisms that may contribute to the oncogenicity of the virus to invade and hijack host immune systems. Our analysis finds that significant levels of intrinsic disorder are present in proteins LT, ALTO, 57kT, and VP1, and suggests that regions of sT may also contain large, disordered regions. The investigation further shows correlation of disorder propensity with the outputs for functional predictors of eukaryotic linear motifs (ELMs), molecular recognition features (MoRFs), and propensity for liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Our findings indicate that MCPyV may use disorder and phase condensation to alter viral function that may accentuate or provide the basis for oncogenic activities. It is intended that this study will inform future experimental validation efforts around the phase separation capacity of MCPyV and its host protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, we hope to inform other investigators on the potential role of disorder in the MCPyV life cycle toward ultimately progressing the development of novel therapeutic agents.",

A retrospective analysis of clinical data of 157 patients over 65 with cognitive impairment who were hospitalized in the comprehensive ward from October 2019 to February 2023 was conducted. Patients were assigned into delirium and non-delirium groups according to whether they exhibited delirium during hospitalization. General information about the patients and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, blood C-reactive protein level, and blood superoxide dismutase (SOD) level were recorded. Univariate analysis was used to identify potential risk factors for delirium, and factors with statistical significance were subjected to multivariate logistic regression analysis. A prediction line chart for delirium in elderly dementia patients was constructed using R 4.03 software, and the model was validated. Among the 157 patients with senile dementia, 42 patients exhibited delirium and 115 patients exhibited non-delirium. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, VAS score \u22654 points, use of sedative drugs, and blood SOD <129 U/mL were independent risk factors for delirium during hospitalization in elderly dementia patients. A prediction nomogram was plotted based on the five risk factors, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis presented an area under the curve of .875 (95% CI: .816-.934). The nomogram model was internally validated by the Bootstrap method, and the calibration curve showed good agreement between predicted and actual results. Hosmer-Lemeshow test demonstrated that the model had a good fit and high predictive ability. Diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, VAS \u22654 points, use of sedative drugs, and blood SOD <129 U/mL were independent risk factors for delirium in patients with senile dementia during hospitalization.

Smart technologies, a subset of IoT, can support older adults in aging in place, promoting independent living and improving their quality of life. However, there is a lack of research on how older adults and smart technologies coadapt over time to maximize their benefits and sustain adoption. We will aim to comprehensively review and analyze the existing scientific literature pertaining to the coadaptation between smart technologies and older adults. The primary focus will be to investigate the extent and nature of this coadaptation process and explore how older adults and technology coevolve over time to enhance older adults' experience with technology. This scoping review will follow the methodology outlined in the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer's Manual and adhere to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines for reporting. Peer-reviewed articles will be searched in databases like Ovid MEDLINE, OVID Embase, PEDro, OVID PsycINFO, EBSCO CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and Global Index Medicus. The research team will create a data extraction form covering study characteristics, participant characteristics, underlying models and frameworks, research findings, implications for technology coadaptation, and any identified study limitations. A directed content analysis approach will be used, incorporating the Selection, Optimization, and Compensation framework and Sex- and Gender-Based Analysis Plus theoretical framework. The results of this study are expected in January 2024. This scoping review endeavors to present a thorough overview of the available evidence concerning how smart technologies interact with older adults over an extended period. The insights gained from this review will lay the groundwork for a research program that explores how older adults adapt to and use smart technologies throughout their lives, ultimately leading to improved user satisfaction and experience and facilitating aging in place with tailored support and user-centered design principles.

To determine if amyloid PET is associated with reduced hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits over 12 months in patients with MCI or dementia. This nonrandomized controlled trial analyzed participants in the Imaging Dementia-Evidence for Amyloid Scanning (IDEAS) study, an open-label, multisite, longitudinal study that enrolled participants between February 2016 and December 2017 and followed up through December 2018. These participants were recruited at 595 clinical sites that provide specialty memory care across the US. Eligible participants were Medicare beneficiaries 65 years or older with a diagnosis of MCI or dementia within the past 24 months who met published AUC for amyloid PET. Each IDEAS study participant was matched to a control Medicare beneficiary who had not undergone amyloid PET. Data analysis was conducted on December 13, 2022. Participants underwent amyloid PET at imaging centers. The primary end points were the proportions of patients with 12-month inpatient hospital admissions and ED visits. One of 4 secondary end points was the rate of hospitalizations and rate of ED visits in participants with positive vs negative amyloid PET results. Health care use was ascertained from Medicare claims data. The 2 cohorts (IDEAS study participants and controls) each comprised 12\u202f684 adults, including 6467 females (51.0%) with a median (IQR) age of 77 (73-81) years. Over 12 months, 24.0% of the IDEAS study participants were hospitalized, compared with 25.1% of the matched control cohort, for a relative reduction of -4.49% (97.5% CI, -9.09% to 0.34%). The 12-month ED visit rates were nearly identical between the 2 cohorts (44.8% in both IDEAS study and control cohorts) for a relative reduction of -0.12% (97.5% CI, -3.19% to 3.05%). Both outcomes fell short of the prespecified effect size of 10% or greater relative reduction. Overall, 1467 of 6848 participants (21.4%) with positive amyloid PET scans were hospitalized within 12 months compared with 1081 of 4209 participants (25.7%) with negative amyloid PET scans (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.78-0.89). Results of this nonrandomized controlled trial showed that use of amyloid PET was not associated with a significant reduction in 12-month hospitalizations or ED visits.

        "AbstractText": "Factors associated with synapse loss beyond amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and neurofibrillary tangles may more closely correlate with the emergence of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer disease (AD) and be relevant for early therapeutic intervention. To investigate whether accumulation of tau oligomers in synapses is associated with excessive synapse elimination by microglia or astrocytes and with cognitive outcomes (dementia vs no dementia [hereinafter termed resilient]) of individuals with equal burdens of AD neuropathologic changes at autopsy. This cross-sectional postmortem study included 40 human brains from the Massachusetts Alzheimer Disease Research Center Brain Bank with Braak III to IV stages of tau pathology but divergent antemortem cognition (dementia vs resilient) and cognitively normal controls with negligible AD neuropathologic changes. The visual cortex, a region without tau tangle deposition at Braak III to IV stages, was assessed after expansion microscopy to analyze spatial relationships of synapses with microglia and astrocytes. Participants were matched for age, sex, and apolipoprotein E status. Evidence of Lewy bodies, TDP-43 aggregates, or other lesions different from AD neuropathology were exclusion criteria. Tissue was collected from July 1998 to November 2020, and analyses were conducted from February 1, 2022, through May 31, 2023. Amyloid-\u03b2 plaques, tau neuropil thread burden, synapse density, tau oligomers in synapses, and internalization of tau oligomer-tagged synapses by microglia and astrocytes were quantitated. Analyses were performed using 1-way analysis of variance for parametric variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for nonparametric variables; between-group differences were evaluated with Holm-\u0160\u00edd\u00e1k tests. Of 40 included participants (mean [SD] age at death, 88 [8] years; 21 [52%] male), 19 had early-stage dementia with Braak stages III to IV, 13 had resilient brains with similar Braak stages III to IV, and 8 had no dementia (Braak stages 0-II). Brains with dementia but not resilient brains had substantial loss of presynaptic (43%), postsynaptic (33%), and colocalized mature synaptic elements (38%) compared with controls and significantly higher percentages of mature synapses internalized by IBA1-positive microglia (mean [SD], 13.3% [3.9%] in dementia vs 2.6% [1.9%] in resilient vs 0.9% [0.5%] in control; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and by GFAP-positive astrocytes (mean [SD], 17.2% [10.9%] in dementia vs 3.7% [4.0%] in resilient vs 2.7% [1.8%] in control; P\u2009=\u2009.001). In brains with dementia but not in resilient brains, tau oligomers more often colocalized with synapses, and the proportions of tau oligomer-containing synapses inside microglia (mean [SD] for presynapses, mean [SD], 7.4% [1.8%] in dementia vs 5.1% [1.9%] resilient vs 3.7% [0.8%] control; P\u2009=\u2009.006; and for postsynapses 11.6% [3.6%] dementia vs 6.8% [1.3%] resilient vs 7.4% [2.5%] control; P\u2009=\u2009.001) and astrocytes (mean [SD] for presynapses, 7.0% [2.1%] dementia vs 4.3% [2.2%] resilient vs 4.0% [0.7%] control; P\u2009=\u2009.001; and for postsynapses, 7.9% [2.2%] dementia vs 5.3% [1.8%] resilient vs 3.0% [1.5%] control; P\u2009<\u2009.001) were significantly increased compared with controls. Those changes in brains with dementia occurred in the absence of tau tangle deposition in visual cortex. The findings from this cross-sectional study suggest that microglia and astrocytes may excessively engulf synapses in brains of individuals with dementia and that the abnormal presence of tau oligomers in synapses may serve as signals for increased glial-mediated synapse elimination and early loss of brain function in AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Gerstmann Str\u00e4ussler Scheinker (GSS) is an inherited, invariably fatal prion disease. Like other human prion diseases, GSS is caused by missense mutations in the prion protein (PrP) gene (PRNP), and by the formation and overtime accumulation of the misfolded, pathogenic scrapie PrP (PrPSc). The first mutation identified in the PRNP gene, and the one blamed as the main cause of the disease, is c.C305T:p.P102L. The Sanger sequencing method was performed on the PRNP gene for the detection of c.C305T:p.P102L mutations in a cohort of 10 subjects; moreover, a study was carried out, using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), by sequencing a group of genes related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), movement disorders and dementia which show a phenotypic profile similar to that of GSS. The results obtained from the study using NGS indicate the potential role of other genetic variants which could contribute to the various GSS phenotypes. In conclusion, we highlight the large clinical variability in subjects presenting with GSS and p.P102L, as well as the hypothesis that the mutation in PrP codon 102 alone is not sufficient to trigger the cardinal clinical signs of the disease; furthermore, we do not exclude the possibility that further genetic variants play a decisive role in the aspects of the various phenotypes with which GSS manifests itself.",

Anti-amyloid and anti-tau antibodies are the most advanced therapeutic approach at present. Three drugs (lecanemab, donanemab and aducanumab) are on track to be marketed in the coming months. In this systematic review, we review all Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials conducted in this indication and the particularities of the molecules tested. The PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched through February 2023 for Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials involving passive anti-amyloid or anti-tau immunotherapies with published results. This review has been compiled in compliance with the PRISMA checklists. Of the 165 studies found and after eliminating duplicates, 40 studies had their results published on PubMed and/or ClinicalTrials.gov. Eight anti-amyloid molecules and four anti-tau molecules were the subject of Phase 2 studies, seven anti-amyloids were the subject of Phase 3 trials, and two molecules were granted early marketing approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The results were compiled in summary tables showing the primary endpoints used, results, age of the study population and specific adverse events for these molecules. Passive immunotherapy in AD is largely dominated by anti-amyloid antibodies, which are more numerous and more advanced in the pipeline. Lecanemab, donanemab and aducanumab are distinguished by their relative efficacy in terms of cognitive and functional evaluation but also by a decrease in amyloid and tau proteins in the brain. These three molecules have in common that they bind to N-terminal ends of amyloid fibrils and plaques. The findings of their studies raise the question of which criteria to apply when choosing which patient will receive them when marketed, such as the apoliprotein E gene's fourth allele (APOE4) genetic status of patients. The large number of negative studies may also raise the question of the criteria for defining the disease and the possible interest in redefining it on biological grounds to offer a more personalized medicine to patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases.",

Cancer history was associated with smaller mean hippocampal volume (b\u00a0=\u00a0-19 mm3 , 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-36, -1) and lower mean cortical thickness in the Alzheimer's disease signature region (b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.004 mm, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.007, -0.000). Quantile regressions indicated individuals most vulnerable to ADRD were more affected by cancer history. Some brain MRI markers associated with ADRD risk were elevated in adults with a history of cancer. The magnitude of the adverse associations varied across quantiles of neuroimaging markers, and the pattern suggests possible harmful associations for individuals already at high ADRD risk. We found no evidence of an inverse association between cancer history and ADRD-related neurodegeneration.

In addition to its primary effects, AD causes metabolic defects and tissues are damaged due to these effects. Oxidative stress damages cells by disrupting antioxidant/oxidant balance in many tissues, especially due to AD. In individuals with AD and the elderly, lens tissue is damaged due to oxidative stress and may cause vision loss. Therefore, it is very important to investigate herbal products that both prevent/cure AD and reduce AD-related oxidative stress, as they may have fewer side effects. In this study, the protective effects of parsley extract on lens tissues of experimental AD model induced by scopolamine were examined and evaluated through biochemical parameters. The result of biochemical experiments and principal component analysis, it was observed that parsley extract had a therapeutic effect by reducing oxidative stress in lens tissues of experimentally induced AD rats. It can be suggested that the phenolic and flavonoid-rich content of parsley extract may have caused the reduction of oxidative damage in lens tissues and can be used to protect lens tissue against oxidative stress due to AD disease.",

For several decades phytochemicals were used as Ayurveda to treat both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a widely chosen therapeutic target for the development of early prevention and effective management of neurodegenerative diseases. The primary objective of the present study was to investigate the binding potential between Rutin Thymoquinone, Hesperidin and the FDA-approved drug Donepezil with AChE. Additionally, a comparative analysis was conducted. These phytochemicals were docked with the binding site of the AChE experimental complex. The molecular dockings demonstrated that the Hesperidinh showed a better binding affinity of -22.0631\u2009kcal/mol. The ADME/T investigations revealed that the selected phytochemicals are non-toxic and drug-like candidates. Molecular dynamics simulations were implemented to determine the conformational changes of Rutin, hesperidin, Thymoquinone, and Donepezil complexed with AChE. Hesperidin and Donepezil were more stable than Rutin, Thymoquinone complexed with AChE. Next, essential dynamics and defining the secondary structure of protein were to determine the conformational changes in AChE complexed with selected phytochemicals during simulations. Overall, the MD Simulations demonstrated that all complexes in this study achieved stability until 100\u2009ns of the simulation period was performed thrice. The structural analysis of AChE was done using multiple search engines to explore the molecular functions, biological processes, and pathways in which AChE proteins are involved and to identify potential drug targets for various diseases. This present study concludes that Hesperidin was found to be a more potent AChE inhibitors than Rutin, and further experiments are required to determine the effectivity of Hesperidin against neurodegenerative diseases.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

        "AbstractText": "Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular (Eph) receptors and their ligands, ephrins, are the largest subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that have emerged as a new class of cancer biomarkers due to their aberrant expression in cancer progression. The activation of Eph receptors either due to their hyperexpression or via high affinity binding with their respective ephrin ligands initiates a cascade of signals that impacts cancer development and progression. In prostate cancer, the overexpression of the EphA6 receptor has been correlated with increased metastatic potential. Azurin, a small redox protein, is known to prevent tumor progression by binding to cell surface Eph receptors, inhibiting its autophosphorylation in the kinase domain and thereby disrupting Eph-ephrin signaling. Hence, a self-assembled, theranostic nanosystem of recombinant fusion protein his6EGFP-azu (80-128) was designed by conjugating enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) with the C-terminal region of azurin. This design was inspired by the in silico binding study, where the analogue of ephrinA, his6EGFP-azu (80-128) showed higher binding affinity for the EphA6 receptor than the ephrinA ligands. The his6EGFP-azu (80-128) nanosystem which assembled as nanoparticles was tested for its ability to simultaneously detect and kill the prostate cancer cells, LNCaP. This was achieved by specifically targeting EphA6 receptors overexpressed on the cancer cell surface via C-terminal peptide, azu (80-128). Herein, we report antiproliferative, apoptotic, antimigratory, and anti-invasive effects of this nanosystem on LNCaP cells, while having no similar effects on EphA6 negative human normal lung cells, WI-38.",

        "AbstractText": "NMR spectroscopy has been applied to virtually all sites within proteins and biomolecules; however, the observation of sulfur sites remains very challenging. Recent studies have examined 77Se as a replacement for sulfur and applied 77Se NMR in both the solution and solid states. As a spin-1/2 nuclide, 77Se is attractive as a probe of sulfur sites, and it has a very large chemical shift range (due to a large chemical shift anisotropy), which makes it potentially very sensitive to structural and/or binding interactions as well as dynamics. Despite being a spin-1/2 nuclide, there have been rather limited studies of 77Se, and the ability to use 1H-indirect detection has been sparse. Some examples exist, but in the absence of a directly bonded, nonexchangeable 1H, these have been largely limited to smaller molecules. We develop and illustrate approaches using double-labeling of 13C and 77Se in proteins that enable more sensitive triple-resonance schemes via multistep coherence transfers and 1H-detection. These methods require specialized hardware and decoupling schemes, which we developed and will be discussed.",

        "AbstractText": "Many transcription factors (TFs) function as tumor suppressor genes with heterozygous phenotypes, yet haploinsufficiency generally has an underappreciated role in neoplasia. This is no less true in myeloid cells, which are normally regulated by a delicately balanced and interconnected transcriptional network. Detailed understanding of TF dose in this circuitry sheds light on the leukemic transcriptome. In this review, we discuss the emerging features of haploinsufficient transcription factors (HITFs). We posit that: (a) monoallelic and biallelic losses can have distinct cellular outcomes; (b) the activity of a TF exists in a greater range than the traditional Mendelian genetic doses; and (c) how a TF is deleted or mutated impacts the cellular phenotype. The net effect of a HITF is a myeloid differentiation block and increased intercellular heterogeneity in the course of myeloid neoplasia. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Pathology: Mechanisms of Disease, Volume 19 is January 2024.

To evaluate the seroconversion rate in HCW exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the early pandemic phase in 2020 at a regional reference hospital. One hundred seventy-nine HCW working at a regional hospital were invited to a longitudinal study performed between April-July 2020. A serological analysis by ELISA IgG for viral nucleoprotein and protein S with a secondary analysis by ELISA IgG protein S1/S2 for samples with positive or doubtful result was carried out together with a complementary online survey to inquire about occupational or community exposures to SARS-CoV-2. Two cases with baseline infection were detected (1.1%, one symptomatic and one asymptomatic) and no cases of seroconversion were detected. During the study period, there were 136 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and regional weekly COVID-19 incidence ranged from 2.7 to 24.4 per 100,000 inhabitants. No SARS-CoV-2 cases were detected by PCR among 27 HCW who consulted for respiratory symptoms in the period. Online surveys confirmed direct care of COVID-19 patients and also detected a high degree of unprotected social interaction at work. There was no evidence of seroconversion in this group of HCW exposed to the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Personal protective equipment and other measures used by the HCW were extremely useful for their protection in the initial phase of the pandemic.",

Nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics represents a powerful method to characterize the chemical content of complex samples and has been successfully applied to studying a range of conditions. However, an optimized methodology is lacking for analyzing isolated organelles, such as mitochondria. In this study, we report the development of a protocol to metabolically profile mitochondria from healthy, tumoral, and metastatic tissues. Encouragingly, this approach provided quantitative information about up to 45 metabolites in one comprehensive and robust analysis. Our results revealed significant differences between whole-cell and mitochondrial metabolites, which supports a more refined approach to metabolic analysis. We applied our optimized methodology to investigate aggressive and metastatic breast cancer in mouse tissues, discovering that lung mitochondria exhibit an altered metabolic fingerprint. Specific amino acids, organic acids, and lipids showed significant increases in levels when compared with mitochondria from healthy tissues. Our optimized methodology could promote a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer aggressiveness and mitochondrial-related diseases and support the optimization of new advanced therapies.",

This placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase III trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03398655) randomly assigned patients with PROC 1:1 to receive intravenous ofra-vec every 8 weeks with once a week IV paclitaxel or placebo with paclitaxel until disease progression. The dual primary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review. Between December 2017 and March 2022, 409 patients were randomly assigned. The median PFS was 5.29 months in the ofra-vec arm and 5.36 months in the control arm, hazard ratio (HR) 1.03 (CI, 0.83 to 1.29; P = .7823). The median OS with ofra-vec was 13.37 months versus 13.14 months, HR 0.97 (CI, 0.75 to 1.27; P = .8440). Objective response rates (ORRs) per RECIST 1.1 were similar in both arms: 28.9% with ofra-vec versus 29.6% with control. In both treatment arms, response to CA-125 was a substantial prognostic factor for both PFS and OS. In the ofra-vec arm, the HR in CA-125 responders compared with that in nonresponders for PFS was 0.2428 (CI, 0.1642 to 0.3588), and for OS, the HR was 0.3343 (CI, 0.2134 to 0.5238). Safety profile was characterized by common transient flu-like symptoms such as fever and chills. The addition of ofra-vec to paclitaxel did not improve PFS or OS. The PFS and ORR in the control arm exceeded the results that were anticipated on the basis of the AURELIA chemotherapy control arm.

The typical waterfall plot in oncology is a bar plot with each bar representing the best percent tumor size reduction from baseline for a patient sorted in descending order along the x-axis. As new therapies are routinely developed in combination with standard of care or other investigational treatments, waterfall plot comparison between combination therapy and monotherapy may facilitate development decisions in addition to overall response rate or duration of response. However, waterfall plots are often assessed heuristically in practice with lack of statistical rigor. In this work, we examine the correspondence between the waterfall plot and the empirical cumulative distribution function. We demonstrate how to derive key summary statistics directly from the waterfall plot. Using real examples from published waterfall plots, we show how comparisons of waterfall plots can elucidate clinically meaningful information, such as treatment effect patterns in progression-free survival and overall survival.",

Adult patients with GC and histologically proven PM were randomly assigned (1:1) to perioperative chemotherapy and CRS alone (CRS-A) or CRS plus HIPEC (CRS + H). HIPEC comprised mitomycin C 15 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 in 5 L of saline perfused for 60 minutes at 42\u00b0C. The primary end point was OS; secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), other distant metastasis-free survival (MFS), and safety. Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. Between March 2014 and June 2018, 105 patients were randomly assigned (53 patients to CRS-A and 52 patients to CRS + H). The trial stopped prematurely because of slow recruitment. In 55 patients, treatment stopped before CRS mainly due to disease progression/death. Median OS was the same for both groups (CRS + H, 14.9 [97.2% CI, 8.7 to 17.7] months v CRS-A, 14.9 [97.2% CI, 7.0 to 19.4] months; P = .1647).

Paclitaxel titration protocols that may reduce reactions are empirically derived from clinical observations, and there are no phase III trials that confirm superiority of any management recommendations. The purpose of this study was to compare the frequency and severity of hypersensitivity reactions associated with a recently initiated standardized paclitaxel titration protocol verses standard-of-care (SOC) infusion protocols. This was a retrospective review of hypersensitivity reactions in patients receiving paclitaxel infusions at five ambulatory infusion centers using a standardized titration protocol (February 2021 to April 2021) versus SOC paclitaxel (November 2018 to December 2019). Patients were age 18 years or older and presented for their first or second infusions. The primary study measure was the rate of hypersensitivity reactions. Secondary evaluations included the timing of the reaction after the start of the infusion, use of premedications, and severity of reactions. A total of 451 patients were included in this study. Eighty-four (18.6%) patients were identified in the titration protocol group and 367 (81.4%) patients in the SOC group. Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 4.8% of the titration group and 18.3% of the SOC group (odds ratio [OR], 0.224; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.74; P = .002). Grade 3 or greater infusion reactions were 0% in the titration group versus 18% in the SOC group (OR, 0.28; P < .008). Reactions occurred later with the titration protocol, compared with the SOC paclitaxel infusion. Finally, no differences were observed in the use of appropriate premedications. A standardized paclitaxel titration protocol was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions in patients receiving their first and second infusions. A prospective randomized trial is needed to validate these observations.",

This study aimed to develop a natural language processing (NLP) model for identifying patients with high-risk NMIBC retrospectively from unstructured electronic medical records (EMRs) and to apply the model to describe patient and tumor characteristics. We used three independent EMR-derived data sets including adult patients with a bladder cancer diagnosis in 2011-2020 for NLP model development and training (n = 140), validation (n = 697), and application for the retrospective cohort analysis (n = 4,402). Deep learning methods were used to train NLP recognition of medical chart terminology to identify seven high-risk NMIBC criteria; model performance was assessed using the F1 score, weighted across features. An algorithm was then used to classify each patient as high-risk NMIBC (yes/no). Manually reviewed records served as the gold standard. The F1 scores after model training were >0.7 for all but one uncommon feature (prostatic urethral involvement). The highest area under the receiver operating curves (AUC) was observed for Ta (0.897) and T1 (0.897); the lowest AUC was for carcinoma in situ (CIS; 0.617). For high-risk NMIBC classification, positive predictive value was 79.4%, negative predictive value was 93.2%, and false-positive rate was 8.9%. Sensitivity and specificity were 83.7% and 91.1%, respectively. Of 748 patients manually confirmed as having high-risk NMIBC, 196 (26%) had CIS (of whom 19% also had T1 and 23% also had Ta disease); 552 tumors (74%) had no associated CIS. The NLP model, combined with a rule-based algorithm, identified high-risk NMIBC with good performance and will enable future work to study real-world treatment patterns and clinical outcomes for high-risk NMIBC.",

        "AbstractText": "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways are involved in cancer growth and survival; however, the clinical efficacy of single inhibitors of each pathway is limited or transient owing to resistance mechanisms, such as feedback signaling and/or re-expression of receptor-type tyrosine kinases (RTKs). This study identified a potent and novel kinase inhibitor, TAS0612, and characterized its properties. We found that TAS0612 is a potent, orally available compound that can inhibit p90RSK (RSK), AKT, and p70S6K (S6K) as a single agent and showed a strong correlation with the growth inhibition of cancer cells with PTEN loss or mutations, regardless of the presence of KRAS and BRAF mutations. Additional RSK inhibitory activity may differentiate the sensitivity profile of TAS0612 from that of signaling inhibitors that target only the PI3K pathway. Moreover, TAS0612 demonstrated broad-spectrum activity against tumor models wherein inhibition of MAPK or PI3K pathways was insufficient to exert antitumor effects. TAS0612 exhibited a stronger growth-inhibitory activity against the cancer cell lines and tumor models with dysregulated signaling with the genetic abnormalities described above than treatment with inhibitors against AKT, PI3K, MEK, BRAF, and EGFR/HER2. Additionally, TAS0612 demonstrated the persistence of blockade of downstream growth and anti-apoptotic signals, despite activation of upstream effectors in the signaling pathway and FoxO-dependent re-expression of HER3. In conclusion, TAS0612 with RSK/AKT/S6K inhibitory activity may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer patients to improve clinical responses and overcome resistance mechanisms.",

        "AbstractText": "During aging, the cellular response to unfolded proteins is believed to decline, resulting in diminished proteostasis. In model organisms, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, proteostatic decline with age has been linked to proteome solubility shifts and the onset of protein aggregation. However, this correlation has not been extensively characterized in aging mammals. To uncover age-dependent changes in the insoluble portion of a mammalian proteome, we analyzed the detergent-insoluble fraction of mouse brain tissue by mass spectrometry. We identified a group of 171 proteins, including the small heat shock protein \u03b1-crystallin, that become enriched in the detergent-insoluble fraction obtained from old mice. To enhance our ability to detect features associated with proteins in that fraction, we complemented our data with a meta-analysis of studies reporting the detergent-insoluble proteins in various mouse models of aging and neurodegeneration. Strikingly, insoluble proteins from young and old mice are distinct in several features in our study and across the collected literature data. In younger mice, proteins are more likely to be disordered, part of membraneless organelles, and involved in RNA binding. These traits become less prominent with age, as an increased number of structured proteins enter the pellet fraction. This analysis suggests that age-related changes to proteome organization lead a group of proteins with specific features to become detergent-insoluble. Importantly, these features are not consistent with those associated with proteins driving membraneless organelle formation. We see no evidence in our system of a general increase of condensate proteins in the detergent-insoluble fraction with age.",

Here, we investigate Leishmania donovani bromodomain factor 5 (LdBDF5) as a target for antileishmanial drug discovery. LdBDF5 contains a pair of bromodomains (BD5.1 and BD5.2) in an N-terminal tandem repeat. We purified recombinant bromodomains of L. donovani BDF5 and determined the structure of BD5.2 by X-ray crystallography. Using a histone peptide microarray and fluorescence polarization assay, we identified binding interactions of LdBDF5 bromodomains with acetylated peptides derived from histones H2B and H4. In orthogonal biophysical assays including thermal shift assays, fluorescence polarization, and NMR, we showed that BDF5 bromodomains bind to human bromodomain inhibitors SGC-CBP30, bromosporine, and I-BRD9; moreover, SGC-CBP30 exhibited activity against Leishmania promastigotes in cell viability assays. These findings exemplify the potential BDF5 holds as a possible drug target in Leishmania and provide a foundation for the future development of optimized antileishmanial compounds targeting this epigenetic reader protein.",

        "AbstractText": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become the standard of care for patients with mismatch repair-deficient/microsatellite instability-high (dMMR/MSI-H) colorectal cancer (CRC). However, biomarkers of response to ICIs are still lacking. Forty-two patients with dMMR CRC treated with neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade were prospectively enrolled. To identify biomarkers of pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy, we analyzed genomic and transcriptomic profiles based on next-generation sequencing, and immune cell density based on multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) staining. An integrated analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing from our previous study and GSE178341, as well as mIF was performed to further explore the significance of the tumor microenvironment (TME) on pCR response. The tumor mutation burden of both tumor tissue and plasma blood samples was comparable between the pCR and non-pCR groups, while HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 were significantly overexpressed in the pCR group. Gene signature enrichment analysis showed that pathways including T cell receptor pathway, antigen presentation pathway were significantly enriched in the pCR group. In addition, higher pre-existing CD8+ T cell density was associated with pCR response (767.47 per.mm2 vs. 326.64 per.mm2, P=0.013 Wilcoxon test). Further integrated analysis showed that CD8+ T cells with low PD-1 expression (PD-1lo CD8+ T cells) expressing high levels of TRGC2, CD160, KLRB1 and low levels of proliferated and exhausted genes were significantly associated with pCR response. Immune-associated transcriptomic features, particularly CD8+ T cells were associated with pCR response to ICI in dMMR CRC. Heterogeneity of TME within dMMR CRC may help to discriminate patients with complete response to neoadjuvant ICI.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Regulation and function of alternative polyadenylation in development and differentiation.",
        "AbstractText": "Alternative processing of nascent mRNAs is widespread in eukaryotic organisms and greatly impacts the output of gene expression. Specifically, alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) is a co-transcriptional molecular process that switches the polyadenylation site (PAS) at which a nascent mRNA is cleaved, resulting in mRNA isoforms with different 3'UTR length and content. APA can potentially affect mRNA translation efficiency, localization, stability, and mRNA seeded protein-protein interactions. APA naturally occurs during development and cellular differentiation, with around 70% of human genes displaying APA in particular tissues and cell types. For example, neurons tend to express mRNAs with long 3'UTRs due to preferential processing at PASs more distal than other PASs used in other cell types. In addition, changes in APA mark a variety of pathological states, including many types of cancer, in which mRNAs are preferentially cleaved at more proximal PASs, causing expression of mRNA isoforms with short 3'UTRs. Although APA has been widely reported, both the function of APA in development and the mechanisms that regulate the choice of 3'end cut sites in normal and pathogenic conditions are still poorly understood. In this review, we summarize current understanding of how APA is regulated during development and cellular differentiation and how the resulting change in 3'UTR content affects multiple aspects of gene expression. With APA being a widespread phenomenon, the advent of cutting-edge scientific techniques and the pressing need for in-vivo studies, there has never been a better time to delve into the intricate mechanisms of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors associated with bile leakage and to assess the outcomes and cost efficiency of strategies used to treat bile leakage. Patients who underwent endocystectomy between 2005 and 2020 were included. The preoperative characteristics, intra- and postoperative outcomes, hospital costs, and cost efficiency (the Diagnosis-Related Group reimbursement minus the overall cost) were evaluated prospectively. A total of eighty patients with 142 cysts were included. Postoperative complications occurred in 17 patients (21%), including 11 patients with bile leakage (type A: 1, type B: 6 and type C: 4 patients, total 13%). Bile leakage was more frequent in patients with preoperative MRI signs of cysto-biliary fistulas or intraoperative visible cysto-biliary fistulas (p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively) and in patients with cysts larger than 8 cm (p = 0.03). Patients with bile leakage who underwent reoperation (type C) had significantly shorter hospital stays (9 vs. 16 days, p<0.01) and better cost efficiency than those who received radiologic or endocscopic interventions (\u20ac2,072 vs. -\u20ac2,097 p = 0.01). No mortality was observed, and recurrence was seen in two patients. Endocystectomy is a safe and efficient technique. Preoperative and intraoperative cysto-biliary fistulas and a cyst diameter larger than 8 cm are correlated to postoperative bile leakage. Early operative management of bile leakage reduces hospital stay and improves cost efficiency compared with radiologic or endoscopic treatments.",

The authors linked administrative databases including cytology, pathology, cancer registries, and physician billing history to identify participants referred to colposcopy between January 2012 and December 2013 with high-grade cytology (atypical squamous cells [ASC]-H, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL], invasive squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, atypical glandular cells [AGC], adenocarcinoma in situ) and had <CIN2 (with and without biopsy confirmation) at colposcopy. Three- and 5-year risks of CIN3 and invasive cervical cancer were generated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Among 4,168 women referred to colposcopy for ASC-H, HSIL, squamous cell carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma, the 3- and 5-year CIN3 incidence rates were 17.7%/20.0% no biopsy, 13.0%/15.1% negative biopsy, and 18.9%/20.0% low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) biopsies. The 3- and 5-year incidences of invasive cancer were: 1.25%/1.68% no biopsy, 0.78%/1.04% negative biopsy, and 0%/0% LSIL biopsy. When the initial cytology was AGC/adenocarcinoma in situ (n = 944), the 3- and 5-year rates of CIN3 were 7.42%/8.39% no biopsy, 7.41%/9.26% negative biopsy, and 7.69%/7.69% LSIL biopsy. The invasive cancer rates were 1.12%/1.54% no biopsy, 0.46%/0.46% negative biopsy, and 0.0%/0.0% LSIL biopsy. By screening cytology, participants referred for HSIL had the highest 3- and 5-year rates of CIN3 (18.9% and 21%) compared with AGC (7.22%/8.28%) and ASC-H (15.5%/18%). The 3- and 5-year invasive cancer rates were 1.38%/1.75% HSIL, 0.85%/1.17% AGC, and 0.91%/1.36% ASC-H. In participants referred for high-grade cytology where colposcopy shows <CIN2, the subsequent risk of invasive cancer at 5 years is sufficiently elevated to warrant close surveillance in colposcopy.",

        "AbstractText": "Sphingolipids are required for diverse biological functions and are degraded by specific catabolic enzymes. However, the mechanisms that regulate sphingolipid catabolism are not known. Here we characterize a transcriptional axis that regulates sphingolipid breakdown to control resistance against bacterial infection. From an RNAi screen for transcriptional regulators of pathogen resistance in the nematode C. elegans, we identified the nuclear hormone receptor nhr-66, a ligand-gated transcription factor homologous to human hepatocyte nuclear factor 4. Tandem chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing and RNA sequencing experiments revealed that NHR-66 is a transcriptional repressor, which directly targets sphingolipid catabolism genes. Transcriptional de-repression of two sphingolipid catabolic enzymes in nhr-66 loss-of-function mutants drives the breakdown of sphingolipids, which enhances host susceptibility to infection with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These data define transcriptional control of sphingolipid catabolism in the regulation of cellular sphingolipids, a process that is necessary for pathogen resistance.",

        "AbstractText": "The intrinsic regulation of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression remains unclear. Here, we report that zinc-finger protein 652 (ZNF652) is a potent transcription repressor of PD-L1. ZNF652 frequently experiences loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in various cancers. Higher LOH rate and lack of estrogen-inducible transcription lead to suppressed expression of ZNF652 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Mechanistically, ZNF652 is physically associated with the NuRD transcription co-repressor complex to repress a cohort of genes, including PD-L1. Overexpression of ZNF652 inhibits PD-L1 transcription, whereas depletion of ZNF652 upregulates PD-L1. Loss of ZNF652 in TNBC unleashes PD-L1-mediated immune evasion both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Significantly, ZNF652 expression is progressively lost during breast cancer progression, and a low ZNF652 level is correlated with elevated PD-L1 expression, less infiltrated CD8+ T\u00a0cells, and poor prognosis in TNBC. Our study provides insights into PD-L1 regulation and supports the pursuit of ZNF652 as a potential biomarker and drug target for breast cancer immunotherapy.",

        "AbstractText": "The aim of this study was to clarify the significance of DNA methylation alterations of cryptogenic hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Using the Infinium assay, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of 250 liver tissue samples, including non-cancerous liver tissue (U-N) and corresponding cancerous tissue (U-T) from patients with cryptogenic HCC without a history of excessive alcohol use and hepatitis virus infection, and whose U-N samples showed no remarkable histological features (no microscopic evidence of simple steatosis, any form of hepatitis including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH], or liver cirrhosis). We identified 3,272 probes that showed significant differences of DNA methylation levels between U-N and normal liver tissue samples from patients without HCC, indicating that a distinct DNA methylation profile had already been established at the precancerous U-N stage. U-Ns have a DNA methylation profile differing from that of non-cancerous liver tissue of patients with NASH-related, viral hepatitis-related, and alcoholic liver disease-related HCCs. Such DNA methylation alterations in U-Ns were inherited by U-Ts. The U-Ns showed DNA methylation alteration of ADCY5 resulting in alteration of its mRNA expression, whereas non-cancerous liver tissue of patients with NASH-, viral hepatitis-, or alcoholic liver disease-related HCCs did not. DNA methylation levels of MICAL2 and PLEKHG2 in U-Ts were correlated with larger tumor diameter and portal vein involvement, respectively. U-N-specific DNA hypermethylation of ADCY5 may have significance even from the precancerous stage in liver showing no remarkable histological features. DNA hypomethylation of MICAL2 and PLEKHG2 may determine the clinicopathological features of cryptogenic HCC. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

Also, studies of ongoing Colorectal Cancer Screening programs have found more frequent and severe physical harm from screening procedures, e.g., bleeding and perforation, than reported in previous trials. Therefore, the objectives of the study were to systematically review the evidence on the risk of bleeding and perforation in Colorectal Cancer Screening. Systematic review with descriptive statistics and random-effects meta-analyses. We systematically searched five databases for studies investigating physical harms related to Colorectal Cancer Screening. We assessed the internal and the external validity using the ROBINS-I tool and the GRADE approach. Harm estimates was calculated using mixed Poisson regression models in random-effect meta-analyses. We included 89 studies. Reporting and measurement of harms was inadequate in most studies. In effect, the risk of bias was critical in 97.3% and serious in 98.3% of studies. All GRADE ratings were very low. Based on severe findings with not-critical risk of bias and 30 days follow-up, the risk of bleedings per 100,000 people screened were 8 [2;24] for sigmoidoscopy, 229 [129;408] for colonoscopy following fecal immunochemical test, 68 [39;118] for once-only colonoscopy, and 698 [443;1045] for colonoscopy following any screening tests. The risk of perforations was 88 [56;138] for colonoscopy following fecal immunochemical test and 53 [25;112] for once-only colonoscopy. There were no findings within the subcategory severe perforation with long-term follow-up for colonoscopy following any screening tests and sigmoidoscopy. Harm estimates varied widely across studies, reporting and measurement of harms was mostly inadequate, and the risk of bias and GRADE ratings were very poor, collectively leading to underestimation of harm.

We used a cross-sectional design to obtain self-reported data in 2019 from a chain-referral sample of 213 Chinese students. Among 125 respondents who were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, the reported barriers to receiving the HPV vaccine included: (a) lack of recommendations from a healthcare provider, (b) lack of risk perception for HPV infection, and (c) limited knowledge about HPV vaccination locations. The influential advisors for receiving HPV vaccination were doctors, parents, self, nurses, and same-sex friends. Multivariate analysis revealed that unvaccinated respondents were more likely to report the following barriers to HPV vaccination: (a) lack of recommendations from a healthcare provider, (b) lack of risk perception for HPV infection, (c) limited knowledge about vaccination locations, and (d) uncertainty about effectiveness. High Asian identified respondents were more likely to perceive barriers related to limited knowledge about vaccination locations and uncertainty about effectiveness, while they were less likely to state nurses as influential advisors. Individuals who received one or more HPV vaccine doses were more inclined to view same-sex friends and nurses as influential advisors for HPV vaccination. The influence of culture on preferences for information sources, such as specific providers and provider gender, needs to be addressed.

Nevertheless, the hour-level operation time and high cost caused by the frequent redesign/reconstruction of gates, tedious strand-displacement reaction, and expensive labeled probes (or tool enzymes) in previous works are ineluctable drawbacks. Herein, we report an ultrafast and cost-effective system for engineering concurrent DNA logic nanodevices (CDLNs) by combining polythymine CuNCs with SYBR Green I (SG I) as universal dual-output producers. Particularly, benefiting from the concomitant minute-level quick response of both unlabeled illuminators and the exquisite strand-displacement-free design, all CDLNs including contrary logic pairs (YES\u2227NOT, OR\u2227NOR, and Even\u2227Odd number classifier), noncontrary ones (IDE\u2227IMP, OR\u2227NAND), and concatenated circuits are implemented in just 10 min via a \"one-stone-two-birds\" method, resulting in only 1/12 the operation time and 1/4 the cost needed in previous works, respectively. Moreover, all of them share the same threshold value, and the dual output can be easily visualized by the naked eye under a portable UV lamp, indicating the universality and practicality of this system. Furthermore, by exploiting the \"positive/negative cross-verification\" advantages of concurrent contrary logic, the smart in vitro analysis of the polyadenine strand and its polymerase is realized, providing novel molecular tools for the early diagnosis of cancer-related diseases.",

During 2010-2021, hepatitis C virus (HCV) acute and chronic infections (hereinafter referred to as HCV infections) increased in the United States, consequences of which include cirrhosis, liver cancer, and death. Rates of acute infections more than tripled among reproductive-aged persons during this time (from 0.8 to 2.5 per 100,000 population among persons aged 20-29 years and from 0.6 to 3.5 among persons aged 30-39 years). Because acute HCV infection can lead to chronic infection, this has resulted in increasing rates of HCV infections during pregnancy. Approximately 6%-7% of perinatally exposed (i.e., exposed during pregnancy or delivery) infants and children will acquire HCV infection. Curative direct-acting antiviral therapy is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for persons aged \u22653 years. However, many perinatally infected children are not tested or linked to care. In 2020, because of continued increases in HCV infections in the United States, CDC released universal screening recommendations for adults, which included recommendations for screening for pregnant persons during each pregnancy (Schillie S, Wester C, Osborne M, Wesolowski L, Ryerson AB. CDC recommendations for hepatitis C screening among adults-United States, 2020. MMWR Recomm Rep 2020;69[No. RR-2]:1-17). This report introduces four new CDC recommendations: 1) HCV testing of all perinatally exposed infants with a nucleic acid test (NAT) for detection of HCV RNA at age 2-6 months; 2) consultation with a health care provider with expertise in pediatric hepatitis C management for all infants and children with detectable HCV RNA; 3) perinatally exposed infants and children with an undetectable HCV RNA result at or after age 2 months do not require further follow-up unless clinically warranted; and 4) a NAT for HCV RNA is recommended for perinatally exposed infants and children aged 7-17 months who previously have not been tested, and a hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) test followed by a reflex NAT for HCV RNA (when anti-HCV is reactive) is recommended for perinatally exposed children aged \u226518 months who previously have not been tested.

Letermovir, a novel DNA terminase complex inhibitor, reduces the incidence of clinically significant CMV infection (csCMVi) in this population; however, parameters that predict csCMVi after letermovir withdrawal are not well described. Here, we examined clinical and immunological parameters in 294 recipients of PT-Cy based allo HCT, including 157 CMV+ patients of whom 80 completed letermovir prophylaxis without csCMVi, and subsequently stopped letermovir. In this population, the median duration of letermovir exposure was 203 days (interquartile range (IQR): 160 - 250 days). After letermovir withdrawal, the 90-day cumulative incidence of csCMVi was 23.0% (14.3 - 32.8). There were no episodes of CMV end-organ disease. Hypo-gammaglobulinemia prior to letermovir discontinuation was predictive of csCMVi (hazard ratio: 0.33, 95% confidence interval: 0.12-0.93, p = 0.03), whereas T-cell and B-cell reconstitution prior to letermovir withdrawal were not predictive of csCMVi. Higher numbers of NK cells were found prior to letermovir withdrawal in patients that experienced csCMVi (median 202 versus 160, p = 0.03). In CMV+ recipients, CD3+CD4-CD8+ T-cell reconstitution was faster in CMV+ patients regardless of letermovir exposure. Taken together, these data suggest that csCMVi after letermovir withdrawal was frequent in patients treated with PT-Cy, despite prolonged exposure. Strategies to boost CMV specific adaptive immunity in patients with persistent hypo-gammaglobulinemia is a logical pathway to reduce csCMVi after letermovir withdrawal.",

ALK inhibitors are being tried to treat recurrent/refractory ALK+ LBCL. A majority of patients with ALK+ tumors respond to crizotinib, but partial cases ultimately develop resistance about a year later. Here, we report a case of ALK+ LBCL carrying a new fusion gene involving CDK14 and ALK, CLTC-ALK gene rearrangements and MTOR gene mutation. The patient had progressive disease after combination of crizotinib and chemotherapy treatment about 5.5\u2009months later, accompanied by reduced abundance of CDK14-ALK, increased abundance of CLTC-ALK and a novel MFHAS1 gene mutation. However, MTOR mutation turned negative. The patient received alectinib combined with hyper-CVAD, then followed by alectinib as monotherapy for 21\u2009months. The patient achieved partial response and remained in a stable condition. This case suggests that CDK14-ALK fusion gene may be more sensitive to crizotinib than CLTC-ALK fusion gene. MTOR is associated with the anti-tumor mechanism of ALK inhibitors. MFHAS1 gene mutation and/or CLTC-ALK gene copy number amplification may involve resistance to crizotinib. Furthermore, alectinib may inhibit the carcinogenicity of these gene changes and improve the prognosis of ALK+ LBCL. The novel CDK14-ALK fusion gene in ALK+ LBCL was sensitive to crizotinib.MFHAS1 gene mutation and/or CLTC-ALK gene copy number amplification may involve resistance to crizotinib.",

        "AbstractText": "This paper introduces an innovative approach for automated polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images, deploying an enhanced Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) equipped with an integrated attention mechanism in the discriminator. Addressing prevalent challenges in conventional segmentation methods, such as variable polyp appearances, inconsistent image quality, and limited training data, our model significantly augments the precision and reliability of polyp segmentation. The integration of an attention mechanism enables our model to meticulously focus on the intricate features of polyps, improving segmentation accuracy. A unique training strategy, employing both real and synthetic data, is adopted to ensure the model's robust performance under a variety of conditions. The results, validated through rigorous tests on multiple public colonoscopy datasets, indicate a notable improvement in segmentation performance over existing state-of-the-art methods. Our model's enhanced ability to detect critical details early plays a pivotal role in proactive colorectal cancer detection, a key aspect of smart healthcare systems. This work represents an effective amalgamation of advanced AI techniques and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), signifying a noteworthy contribution to the evolution of smart healthcare systems. In conclusion, our attention-enhanced Pix2Pix GAN not only offers efficient and reliable polyp segmentation, but also showcases considerable potential for seamless integration into remote health monitoring systems, underlining the increasing relevance and efficacy of AI in advancing IoMT-enabled healthcare.",

        "AbstractText": "The curative basis of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) relies in part upon the graft versus leukemia (GvL) effect, whereby donor immune cells recognize and eliminate recipient malignant cells. However, alloreactivity of donor cells against recipient tissues may also be deleterious. Chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHD) is an immunologic phenomenon wherein alloreactive donor T cells aberrantly react against host tissues, leading to damaging inflammatory symptoms. Here we discuss biological insights into GvL and cGvHD and strategies to balance prevention of GvHD with maintenance of GvL in modern HSCT. Relapse remains the leading cause of mortality after HSCT with rates as high as 40% for some diseases. GvHD is a major cause of morbidity after HSCT, occurring in up to half of patients and responsible for 15-20% of deaths after HSCT. Intriguingly, development of chronic GvHD may be linked to lower relapse rates after HSCT, suggesting that GvL and GvHD may be complementary sides of the immunologic foundation of HSCT. The ability to fine tune the balance of GvL and GvHD will lead to improvements in survival, relapse rates, and quality of life for patients undergoing HSCT.",

The current study examined the relationship between implicit bias (based on cancer type and ethnicity) and medical students' empathic communication in encounters with standardized patients who presented as Hispanic (lung or colorectal) individuals diagnosed with cancer. Participants (101 medical students) completed the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure implicit bias based on cancer type (lung v. colorectal) and ethnicity (Hispanic v. non-Hispanic White). Empathic opportunities and responses (assessed by the Empathic Communication Coding System; ECCS) were evaluated in a mock consultation (Objective Structured Clinical Examination; OSCE) focused on smoking cessation in the context of cancer. Among the 241 empathic opportunities identified across the 101 encounters (M\u2009=\u20092.4), 158 (65.6%) received high empathy responses from the medical students. High empathy responses were most frequently used during challenge (73.2%) and emotion (77.3%) opportunities compared to progress (45.9%) opportunities. Higher levels of implicit bias against Hispanics predicted lower odds of an empathic response from the medical student (OR\u2009=\u20093.24, p\u2009=\u2009.04, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.09-0.95).

        "AbstractText": "Approximately one-third of endocrine-treated women with estrogen receptor-alpha positive (ER+) breast cancers (BC) are at risk of recurrence due to intrinsic or acquired resistance. Thus, it is vital to understand the mechanisms underlying endocrine therapy resistance in ER+ BC to improve patient treatment. Mitochondrial fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation (FAO) has been shown to be a major metabolic pathway in triple-negative BC (TNBC) that can activate Src signaling. Here, we found metabolic reprogramming that increases FAO in ER+ BC as a mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapy. A metabolically relevant, integrated gene signature was derived from transcriptomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic analyses in TNBC cells following inhibition of the FAO rate-limiting enzyme carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1), and this TNBC-derived signature was significantly associated with endocrine resistance in ER+ BC patients. Molecular, genetic, and metabolomic experiments identified activation of AMPK-FAO-oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) signaling in endocrine-resistant ER+ BC. CPT1 knockdown or treatment with FAO inhibitors in vitro and in vivo significantly enhanced the response of ER+ BC cells to endocrine therapy. Consistent with the previous findings in TNBC, endocrine therapy-induced FAO activated the Src pathway in ER+ BC. Src inhibitors suppressed the growth of endocrine-resistant tumors, and the efficacy could be further enhanced by metabolic priming with CPT1 inhibition. Collectively, this study developed and applied a TNBC-derived signature to reveal that metabolic reprogramming to FAO activates the Src pathway to drive endocrine resistance in ER+ BC.",

        "AbstractText": "Although the efficacy and safety of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) in the treatment of malignant tumours, such as breast cancer, have been documented, it remains unclear whether this treatment is effective for centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with microvascular invasion (MVI). This study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of IORT in the treatment of centrally located HCC with MVI. Patients with centrally located HCC, who underwent surgery between January 2016 and January 2020, were enrolled. The patient cohort was then allocated to two groups: those who underwent IORT combined with liver resection (IORT+LR); or LR alone (LR). Propensity score matching and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate recurrence-free survival (RFS), and the log-rank test was used to determine whether RFS differed between the groups. Subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate differences in RFS and early recurrence rates in patients with different MVI grades. E-values were generated to measure the sensitivity to unmeasured confounding factors. In total, 97 patients were enrolled, 27 of whom underwent IORT+LR and 70 underwent LR alone. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS rates in the IORT+LR group were 66%, 50%, and 32%, respectively, whereas those in the LR group were 54%, 37%, and 26%, respectively. After matching analysis, 23 patients were successfully matched, and RFS was found to be significantly different between the two groups (p\u2009=\u2009.04). IORT was an independent prognostic factor for RFS (hazard ratio 0.46 [95% confidence interval 0.21-0.99]). In subgroup analysis, RFS between the IORT+LR and LR groups was significantly different in patients with MVI (M1 grade) (p\u2009=\u2009.0067). The postoperative early recurrence rate was significantly reduced with IORT (p\u2009<\u2009.05). No serious complications were reported in either group following surgery. Based on E-values, the results appeared to be robust against unmeasured confounding factors. IORT+LR provided safe, feasible treatment for patients with centrally located HCC with MVI, along with an improvement in prognosis and lower early recurrence rates.",

        "AbstractText": "Bladder cancer (BC) is the most common cancer of the urinary tract. Bozepinib (BZP), a purine-derived molecule, is a potential compound for the treatment of cancer. Purinergic signaling consists of the activity of nucleosides and nucleotides present in the extracellular environment, modulating a variety of biological actions. In cancer, this signaling is mainly controlled by the enzymatic cascade involving the NTPDase/E-NPP family and ecto-5'-nucleotidase/CD73, which hydrolyze extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine (ADO). The aim of this work is to evaluate the activity of BZP in the purinergic system in BC cell lines and to compare its in vitro antitumor activity with cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic drug widely used in the treatment of BC. In this study, two different BC cell lines, grade 1 RT4 and the more aggressive grade 3 T24, were used along with a human fibroblast cell line MRC-5, a cell used to predict the selectivity index (SI). BZP shows strong antitumor activity, with notable IC50 values (8.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9 \u00b5M for RT4; 6.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 \u00b5M for T24), far from the SI for cisplatin (SI for BZP: 19.7 and 25.7 for RT4 and T24, respectively; SI for cisplatin: 1.7 for T24). BZP arrests T24 cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, inducing early apoptosis. Moreover, BZP increases ATP and ADP hydrolysis and gene/protein expression of the NPP1 enzyme in the T24 cell line. In conclusion, BZP shows superior activity compared to cisplatin against BC cell lines in vitro.",

We had previously identified a secondary metabolite of B. subtilis strain Z15 (BS-Z15), which has an operon that regulates lipopeptide synthesis, and also demonstrated that the fermentation products of this strain exerted antioxidant and pro-immune effects. The purpose of this study was to investigate in vitro and in vivo the anticancer effects of BS-Z15 secondary metabolites (BS-Z15 SMs) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. BS-Z15 SMs significantly inhibited H22 cell-derived murine xenograft tumor growth without any systemic toxicity. In addition, BS-Z15 SMs decreased the viability of H22 cells and BEL-7404 cells in vitro with respective IC50 values of 33.83 and 27.26\u00a0\u00b5g/mL. Consistent with this, BS-Z15 SMs induced apoptosis and G0/G1 phase arrest in the BEL-7404 cells, and the mitochondrial membrane potential was also significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, BS-Z15 SMs upregulated the pro-apoptotic p53, Bax, cytochrome C, and cleaved-caspase-3/9 proteins and downregulated the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. These findings suggest that the induction of apoptosis in HCC cells by BS-Z15 SMs may be related to the mitochondrial pathway. Thus, the secondary metabolites of B. subtilis strain Z15 are promising to become new anti-cancer drugs for the clinical treatment of liver cancer.",

This study aimed at identifying a risk signature of methylation-driven (MD) genes and evaluating its prognostic value for colon cancer (CC) patients. The expression profiles of methylation and mRNA in CC samples were obtained from the TCGA database, and the MethylMix algorithm was used to identify MD genes. The relationships between their expression levels and overall survival (OS) of CC patients were analyzed, and a prognostic signature of MD genes was established. The risk score of gene signature was calculated, and the median was used to divide all patients into high (H) and low (L) risk groups. The prognostic value of gene signature was tested by the TCGA cohort and an independent validation cohort (GSE17538 dataset). In total, 69 MD genes were identified, and 7 were associated with OS of CC patients. Ultimately, 4 (TWIST1, LDOC1, EPHX3, and STC2) were screened out to establish a risk signature. The H-risk patients (>0.923) had a worse OS than L-risk patients (\u22640.923) in both the TCGA (5-year cumulative survival: 52.9% vs 72.0%, P=0.005) and GSE17538 cohort (49.4% vs 69.3%, P=0.004).

Consequently, there has been a lack of exploration into alternative differentiation schemes. In this particular study, we present a transcriptional signature specific to brown adipocytes and white adipocytes. Notably, our findings reveal that ZNF497, ZIC1, ZFY, UTY, USP9Y, TXLNGY, TTTY14, TNNT3, TNNT2, TNNT1, TNNI1, TNNC1, TDRD15, SOX11, SLN, SFRP2, PRKY, PAX3KLHL40, PAX3, INKA2-AS1, SOX11, and TDRD15 exhibit high expression levels in brown adipocytes. XIST, HOXA10, PCAT19, HOXA7, PLSCR3, and AVPR1A exhibited high expression levels in white adipocytes, suggesting their potential as novel marker genes for the transition from white to brown adipocytes. Furthermore, our analysis revealed the coordinated activation of several pathways, including the PPAR signaling pathway, focal adhesion, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and thermogenesis pathways, in brown adipocytes. Moreover, in contrast to prevailing culture techniques, we conducted a comparative analysis of the differentiation protocols for white preadipocytes and brown preadipocytes, revealing that the differentiation outcome remained unaffected by the diverse culture schemes employed. However, the expression levels of certain marker genes in both adipocyte types were found to be altered. This investigation not only identified potential novel marker genes for adipocytes but also examined the impact of different differentiation methods on preadipocyte maturation. Consequently, these findings offer significant insights for further research on the differentiation processes of diverse adipocyte subtypes.",

The outcomes were: (1) time-to-initial surgical treatment, and (2) type of treatment [breast conserving surgery (BCS) vs. mastectomy]. The indicators were reports of four types of patient experiences with care including doctor communication, getting care quickly, getting needed care, and getting needed Rx. Interaction terms in each multivariable logistic model examined if the associations varied by race/ethnicity. Of the 2069 patients, 84.6% were White, 7.6% Black and 7.8% Hispanic. After adjusting for potential confounders, non-Hispanic Black patients who provided excellent reports of their ability to get needed prescriptions had lower odds of receiving surgery within 2-months of diagnosis, compared to NH-Whites who provided less than excellent reports (aOR: 0.29, 95% CI 0.09-0.98). There were no differences based on 1-month or 3-month thresholds. We found no other statistically significant effect of race/ethnicity. As to type of surgery, among NH Blacks, excellent reports of getting care quickly were associated with higher odds of receiving BCS versus mastectomy (aOR: 2.82, 95% CI 1.16-6.85) compared to NH Whites with less than excellent reports. We found no other statistically significant differences by race/ethnicity. Experiences with care are measurable and modifiable factors that can be used to assess and improve aspects of patient-centered care.

The patients who had bilateral BC presented with a higher cT category than the patients who had unilateral BC (p = 0.02), and a higher proportion presented with ILC (17.3 % vs 10.9 %; p = 0.004), estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) disease (89.2 % vs 84.2 %; p = 0.04), multicentric/multifocal disease (37.1 % vs 24.3 %; p < 0.001), breast cancer pathogenic variant (21.7 % vs 12.4 %; p = 0.02), and palpable presentation (48.2 % vs 40.8 %; p = 0.03). The patients with bilateral BC showed DFS similar to that for the unilateral BC cohort (p = 0.71). Bilateral BCs most commonly are biologically concordant between sides. Bilateral BC presented more commonly with larger tumors, lobular histology, ER+ status, multicentricity or multifocality, pathogenic variant, and palpable disease. Bilateral BC is not associated with worse DFS than unilateral BC.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Boric acid Increases Susceptibility to Chemotherapy by Targeting the Ferritinophagy Signaling Pathway in TMZ Resistant Glioblastoma Cells.",
        "AbstractText": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and highly lethal form of brain cancer. Temozolomide (TMZ) is the primary chemotherapy used for GBM, but it has limited effectiveness, with about half of the patients developing resistance. Iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) modulate genes involved in iron metabolism, while the nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) controls iron metabolism through a process called ferritinophagy. In this study, we investigated whether boric acid increases chemosensitivity mediated by ferritinophagy via the NCOA4 and IRP2 signaling pathways in TMZ-resistant GBM cells. First, we generated TMZ-resistant GBM cells (A172-R and T98G-R cells). Next, we investigated the effects of boric acid on cell viability, proliferation, cell cycle, and cell morphology in these cells. Additionally, following boric acid treatment, we analyzed the expression and protein levels of various biochemical markers in these cells. Boric acid treatment in A172-R and T98G-R cells suppressed cell viability and proliferation, arrested these cells in the G1/G0 cell cycle, and induced morphological differences. Boric acid increased NCOA4, IRP2, iron, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in A172-R and T98G-R cells, while glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) levels decreased. Moreover, boric acid treatment increased intracellular iron levels and lipid peroxidation by inducing NCOA4 and IRP2 expression levels in TMZ-resistant cells. According to our results, boric acid may regulate chemosensitivity in A172-R and T98G-R cells mediated by NCOA4 and IRP2. In conclusion, the manipulative effects of boric acid on the ferritinophagy pathway hold the potential to sensitize TMZ-resistant GBM cells to chemotherapy.",

Herein, we aimed to evaluate the potential of salivary metabolomics as an independent risk factor for predicting RP. This study included 62 consecutive patients with NSCLC who underwent thoracic radiotherapy at Tokyo Medical University between September 2016 and December 2018. The median age of the patients was 75\u00a0years (range: 41-89), comprising 47 (75.8%) males and 15 (24.2%) females. Patients with stage I NSCLC received 75\u00a0Gy in 30 fractions, whereas those with stage II and III NSCLC received 66\u00a0Gy in 33 fractions. Saliva samples were collected before treatment and at 2\u00a0weeks, 1\u00a0month, 3\u00a0months, and 1\u00a0year after initiating radiotherapy. Clinical RP was defined as grade 2 according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events. Salivary metabolomics were analyzed using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Salivary metabolites were evaluated as potential predictors of RP. Clinical RP was observed in 11 patients (17.7%); no RP-related deaths were observed. Clinical RP developed at a median of 4\u00a0months (range: 2-6\u00a0months) after initiating radiotherapy. Three metabolites, butyrate, propionate, and hexanoate, collected before radiotherapy exhibited predictive ability for clinical RP. Multivariate logistic analysis indicated butyrate (P\u2009=\u20090.033) as a predictive factor, along with the previously known factor of lung volume irradiated with\u2009>\u200920\u00a0Gy (P\u2009=\u20090.045).

Baseline assessments of anthropometrics, sarcopenia, cachexia status and biomarkers of cachexia were measured in patients with advanced cancer and healthy controls. Thereafter, relationships of the biomarkers with cachexia and sarcopenia were explored. A prospective case-control design was used, including 40 patients with advanced cancer and 40 gender, age-matched controls. Bioelectrical impedance [skeletal muscle index (SMI)] and hand dynamometry [hand grip strength (HGS)] assessed sarcopenia and a validated tool classified cancer cachexia. Albumin, lymphocyte and platelet counts, haemoglobin, C-reactive protein (CRP), pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and citrullinated histone H3 (H3Cit) were measured.

        "AbstractText": "As one of the most common gynecologic malignancies, endometrial cancer (EC) is driven by multiple genetic alterations that may be targeted for treatments. AT-rich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A) gene mutations were reported as early events in endometrial carcinogenesis. To explore the alterations of downstream molecular pathways caused by ARID1A mutations and the associated therapeutic implications, we edited ARID1A gene in human endometrial cancer cell line Ishikawa using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and CRISPR-Associated Proteins (CRISPR/Cas9) technology. We successfully constructed a stable Ishikawa cell line with a confirmed 10\u00a0bp deletion on the ARID1A gene, which resulted in a code-shift mutation and gene knockout. Compared with unedited wild-type cells, ARID1A knockout (KO) led to reduced apoptosis, accelerated transformation from G0/G1 to S phase, and enhanced cell proliferation. ARID1A deficiency would reduce the protein levels of p21, caspase 7, and caspase 9 in Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells compared with the wild-type cells. In addition, ARID1A KO resulted in high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H). Moreover, transcriptomic analyses showed that ARID1A KO can lead to activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling. Furthermore, experimental analyses demonstrated that ARID1A KO cells had reduced expression of genetic instability-associated markers mutL homologue 1 (MLH1) and progesterone receptor B (PR) and increased p-Akt expression. These findings support further exploration of ARID1A as a therapeutic target for EC and provide insight into developing more effective treatments in EC, such as the combinatory use of immune checkpoint inhibitors.",

        "AbstractText": "Bacterial pigments represent a diverse group of secondary metabolites, which confer fitness advantages to the producers while residing in communities. The bioactive potential of such metabolites, including antimicrobial, anticancer, and immunomodulation, are being explored. Reckoning that a majority of such pigments are produced in response to quorum sensing (QS) mediated expression of biosynthetic gene clusters and, in turn, influence cell-cell communication, systemic profiling of the pigments for possible impact on QS appears crucial. A systemic screening of bacterial pigments for QS-inhibition combined with exploration of antibiofilm and antimicrobial action against Acinetobacter baumannii might offer viable alternatives to combat the priority pathogen. Major bacterial pigments are classified (clustered) based on their physicochemical properties, and representatives of the clusters are screened for QS inhibition. The screen highlighted prodigiosin as a potent quorum quencher, although its production from Serratia marcescens appeared to be QS-independent. In silico analysis indicated potential interactions between AbaI and AbaR, two major QS regulators in A. baumannii, and prodigiosin, which impaired biofilm formation, a major QS-dependent process in the bacteria. Prodigiosin augmented antibiotic action of ciprofloxacin against A. baumannii biofilms. Cell viability analysis revealed prodigiosin to be modestly cytotoxic against HEK293, a non-cancer human cell line. While developing dual-species biofilm, prodigiosin producer S. marcescens significantly impaired the fitness of A. baumannii. Enhanced susceptibility of A. baumannii toward colistin was also noted while growing in co-culture with S. marcescens. Antibiotic resistant isolates demonstrated varied responsiveness against prodigiosin, with two resistant strains demonstrating possible collateral sensitivity. Collectively, the results underpin the prospect of a prodigiosin-based therapeutic strategy in combating A. baumannii infection.",

In phase Ib, patients received nivolumab (3\u00a0mg/kg) on Days 1 and 15 and paclitaxel (dose level 1, 70\u00a0mg/m2 or dose level 2, 80\u00a0mg/m2) on Days 1, 8, 15 every four weeks. In phase II, patients with Epstein-Barr virus-related, deficient mismatch repair or programmed cell death-ligand-1-positive AGC were enrolled. The primary endpoints were recommended phase II dose (RP2D, phase Ib) and progression-free survival (PFS, phase II). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), safety, and exploratory biomarker analysis. Dose level 2 was selected as RP2D. In phase II, 48 patients were enrolled. The median PFS and OS were 3.9 and 11.2\u00a0months, respectively. The ORR was 23.3%, and the median response duration was 16.7\u00a0months. Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events, mainly neutropenia, occurred in 20 patients (41.7%). Targeted sequencing revealed that patients with RTK/RAS pathway alterations or the HLA-A02 supertype had better survival. Patients with elevated baseline interleukin-1 receptor antagonist levels had worse survival. Although the study did not meet its primary end point, nivolumab and paclitaxel for AGC demonstrated a durable response with manageable toxicity profiles.

Peptides are produced naturally by all organisms and have a variety of immunomodulatory, physiological, and wound-healing properties. They can also provide protection against microorganisms and tumor cells. Therefore, we aimed to determine the antimicrobial, antibiofilm, and anticancer potentials of Glycyl-Arginine and Lysyl-Aspartic acid dipeptides. The Broth Dilution and Crystal Violet Binding assays assessed the antimicrobial tests and biofilm inhibitory effects. The MTT assay was used to measure the cytotoxic effects of dipeptides on HeLa cell viability. According to our results, Candida\u00a0tropicalis T26 and Proteus mirabilis U15 strains were determined as more resistant to Staphylococcus\u00a0epidermidis W17 against Glycyl-Arginine and Lysyl-Aspartic acid dipeptides with MICs higher than 2\u00a0mM (1\u00a0mg/mL). Sub-MICs of Glycyl-Arginine caused inhibitions against biofilm formation of all the tested clinical isolates, with the highest inhibition observed against S. epidermidisW17. Lysyl-Aspartic acid exhibited zero to no effect against biofilm formation of P. mirabilisU15, and S. epidermidisW17, whereas it exhibited 52% inhibition of biofilm formation of C. tropicalisT26. Cell viability results revealed that HeLa cell viability decreases with increasing concentration of both dipeptides. Also, parallel to antimicrobial tests, Glycyl-Arginine has a greater cytotoxic effect compared to Lysyl-Aspartic acid. The findings from this study will contribute to the advancement of novel strategies involving dipeptide-based synthesizable molecules and drug development studies. However, it is essential to note that there are still challenges, including the need for extensive experimental and clinical trials.",

Hospital resource limitations imposed during the pandemic made it vital to deliver GCC to a patient cohort with COVID-19 and cancer. We aimed to evaluate the implementation of a real-time goals of care intervention and to make recommendations for future pandemics with similar clinical scenarios. This is a retrospective cohort study, of all COVID-19 positive patients admitted to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between March of 2020 and January of 2021. The cohort included the following: (1) patients 18 years of age or older; (2) positive COVID-19 infection; (3) requiring hospitalization. Medical records were reviewed and all patient data including demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes were collected and analyzed in the Syntropy platform, Palantir Foundry, as part of the institutional Data-Driven Determinants of COVID-19 Oncology Discovery Effort (D3CODE) protocol. A multidisciplinary GOC task force developed processes for ease of conducting GOC-PPC and implemented structured documentation. We looked at ACP documentation pre- and post-implementation alongside demographics, length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission rate and mortality. There were 494 unique patients identified, 53% male, 61.5% Caucasian, 16.8% African American, and 3.2% Asian. Active cancer was identified in 84.6% patients, of which 65.6% were solid tumors and 34.4% hematologic malignancies.

Molecular spectroscopic methodologies, such as Raman or infrared spectroscopies, show promise in becoming a leader in screening for early-stage cancer diseases, including PC. However, should such technology be introduced, the identification of differentiating spectral features between various cancer types is required. This would not be possible without the precise extraction of spectra without the contamination by necrosis, inflammation, desmoplasia, or extracellular fluids such as mucous that surround tumor cells. Moreover, an efficient methodology for their interpretation has not been well defined. In this study, we compared different methods of spectral analysis to find the best for investigating the biomolecular composition of PC cells cytoplasm and nuclei separately. Sixteen PC tissue samples of main PC subtypes (ductal adenocarcinoma, intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma, and ampulla of Vater carcinoma) were collected with Raman hyperspectral mapping, resulting in 191,355 Raman spectra and analyzed with comparative methodologies, specifically, hierarchical cluster analysis, non-negative matrix factorization, T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, principal components analysis (PCA), and convolutional neural networks (CNN). As a result, we propose an innovative approach to spectra classification by CNN, combined with PCA for molecular characterization. The CNN-based spectra classification achieved over 98% successful validation rate. Subsequent analyses of spectral features revealed differences among PC subtypes and between the cytoplasm and nuclei of their cells. Our study establishes an optimal methodology for cancer tissue spectral data classification and interpretation that allows precise and cognitive studies of cancer cells and their subcellular components, without mixing the results with cancer-surrounding tissue.

EMBRACE I is a multicenter prospective observational study with 1416 LACC patients (2008-2015). Information on physician-assessed morbidity and patient-reported outcome was assessed at baseline and at regular follow-ups up with the CTCAE v.3 and EORTC-C30/CX24, respectively. Patients with at least 2\u2009years of follow-up were included and data from 3\u2009months to 2 years was used in the analysis. Factor analysis was used on both EORTC and CTCAE data with symptoms and follow-ups as observations. The extracted factors represent clusters of symptoms. Subsequently, regression models were built to investigate associations between the symptom clusters and QOL. The analysis included 742 patients. Despite the differences in the definition of physician-assessed and patient-reported symptoms, similar clusters are identified by the two assessment methods. Three main organ-related clusters are recognized for urinary, gastro-intestinal and vaginal morbidity. Furthermore, a general symptoms cluster where fatigue, pain, insomnia, neuropathy, and hot flashes have large weights is found. Lastly, a cluster with nausea, vomit and lack of appetite is also identified. The general, gastrointestinal and nausea clusters show significant associations with general QOL. This analysis on both PRO and physician-assessed morbidity found a cluster associated with general symptoms and organ-related symptom clusters (urinary, gastrointestinal, vaginal).

This study reveals increased BCLAF1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, in whom elevated BCLAF1 levels are linked to escalated tumor grades and diminished survival rates. Moreover, novel BCLAF1 expression is particularly increased in HCC patients who were not sensitive to the combined treatment of atezolizumab and bevacizumab, but not in patients who had tumors that responded to the combined regimen. Notably, overexpression of BCLAF1 increases HCC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, while the conditioned medium derived from cells overexpressing BCLAF1 strikingly enhances the tube-formation capacity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Furthermore, compelling evidence demonstrates that BCLAF1 attenuates the expression of prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) and governs the stability of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) under normoxic conditions without exerting any influence on transcription, as determined by Western blot and RT\u2012qPCR analyses. Subsequently, employing coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence, we validated the reciprocal interaction between BCLAF1 and Cullin 3 (CUL3), through which BCLAF1 actively upregulates the ubiquitination and degradation of PHD2. The Western blot and RT\u2012qPCR results suggests that programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is one of the downstream responders to HIF-1\u03b1 in HCC. Thus, we reveal the pivotal role of BCLAF1 in promoting PD-L1 transcription and, through binding to CUL3, in promoting the accumulation of HIF-1\u03b1 under normoxic conditions, thereby facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of PHD2.",

        "AbstractText": "Diabetes commonly affects cancer patients. We investigated the influence of diabetes on breast cancer biology using a three-pronged approach that included analysis of orthotopic human tumor xenografts, patient tumors, and breast cancer cells exposed to diabetes/hyperglycemia-like conditions. We aimed to identify shared phenotypes and molecular signatures by investigating the metabolome, transcriptome, and tumor mutational burden. Diabetes and hyperglycemia did not enhance cell proliferation but induced mesenchymal and stem cell-like phenotypes linked to increased mobility and odds of metastasis. They also promoted oxyradical formation and both a transcriptome and mutational signatures of DNA repair deficiency. Moreover, food- and microbiome-derived metabolites tended to accumulate in breast tumors in the presence of diabetes, potentially affecting tumor biology. Breast cancer cells cultured under hyperglycemia-like conditions acquired increased DNA damage and sensitivity to DNA repair inhibitors. Based on these observations, we conclude that diabetes-associated breast tumors may show an increased drug response to DNA damage repair inhibitors.",

This study first observed the inhibitory effect of PPII on cervical cancer cells (Hela) through the establishment of MTT and nude mouse subcutaneous transplantation tumor models. Afterwards, then, we collected Hela cell supernatant for culturing HUVEC cells and treated it with PPII. Observe the invasion, migration, and lumen formation ability of drugs through Transwell, cell scratch test, and angiogenesis experiment. MDC staining was used to observe positive staining in the perinuclear area, AO staining was used to observe acidic areas, and transmission electron microscopy staining was used to observe ultrastructure and autophagy. In addition, the effects of PPII on autophagy- and angiogenesis-related protein expression were detected by Western blotting and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Finally, HUVECs were treated with autophagy inhibitors 3-MA, CQ, and PI3K inhibitor LY294002, respectively. The results showed that the autophagy level of cells treated with PPII was significantly increased. In addition, adding autophagy inhibitors can effectively inhibit angiogenesis in cervical cancer. Further research suggests that PPII induces autophagy in HUVEC cells by regulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, thereby affecting angiogenesis and inhibiting Hela cell proliferation, lumen formation, invasion, and migration.",

        "AbstractText": "Chemotherapy is a cornerstone of cancer treatment, but it can also induce immune suppression, which can have significant implications for patient outcomes. This review paper aims to give a general overview of how chemotherapy affects the immune system and how it affects cancer treatment. Chemotherapy can directly affect immune cells, leading to cytotoxic effects, cell differentiation and function alterations, and cell communication and signaling pathways disruptions. Such immune suppression can weaken the anti-tumor immune response and increase the risk of immune-related toxicities. Understanding the mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced immune suppression is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies. Strategies to mitigate immune suppression include immunomodulatory agents as adjuvants to chemotherapy, combination therapies to enhance immune function, and supportive care measures of the immune system. Additionally, identifying potential biomarkers to predict immune suppression and guide treatment decisions holds promise for personalized cancer medicine. Future directions in this field involve further elucidating underlying mechanisms, exploring novel combination therapies, and developing targeted interventions to minimize immune suppression. By understanding and addressing chemotherapy-induced immune suppression, we can optimize cancer treatment strategies, enhance the anti-tumor immune response, and improve patient outcomes.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of body weight and body mass index (BMI) on trough levels of oral oncolytics with an exposure-response relationship. The oral oncolytics of interest were abiraterone, alectinib, cabozantinib, crizotinib, imatinib, pazopanib, sunitinib and trametinib. This retrospective cohort study included patients treated with the selected oral oncolytics at the standard dose, with a measured trough level at steady state and with available body weight. The Spearman's correlation test was used to determine the correlation between body weight and trough levels. The Fisher's exact text was used to compare the frequency of inadequate trough levels between BMI categories. 1265 patients were included across the different oral oncolytics. A negative correlation coefficient was observed between weight and trough levels for crizotinib (n\u2009=\u200975), imatinib (n\u2009=\u2009201) and trametinib (n\u2009=\u2009310), respectively, \u03c1\u2009=\u2009-\u00a00.41, \u03c1\u2009=\u2009-\u00a00.24 and \u03c1\u2009=\u2009-\u00a00.23, all with a p-value\u2009<\u20090.001.

No statistically significant differences were observed in the frequency of inadequate trough levels between BMI categories. Higher body weight was only correlated with lower plasma trough levels for crizotinib, imatinib, and trametinib.

        "AbstractText": "Aberrant angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with tumor growth, progression, and local or distant metastasis. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) is a transcription factor that plays a major role in regulating angiogenesis during adaptation of tumor cells to nutrient-deprived microenvironment. Genetic defects in Krebs cycle enzymes, such as succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase, result in elevation of oncometabolites succinate and fumarate, thereby increasing HIF-1\u03b1 stability and activating the HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathway. However, whether other metabolites regulate HIF-1\u03b1 stability remains unclear. Here, we reported that the enzyme in phenylalanine/tyrosine catabolism glutathione S-transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1) deficiency led to accumulation of succinylacetone, which was structurally similar to \u03b1-ketoglutarate. Succinylacetone competed with \u03b1-ketoglutarate for PHD2 binding and inhibited PHD2 activity, preventing hydroxylation of HIF-1\u03b1, thus resulting in its stabilization and consequent expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Our findings suggest that GSTZ1 may serve as an important tumor suppressor owing to its ability to inhibit the HIF-1\u03b1/VEGFA axis in HCC. Moreover, we explored the therapeutic potential of HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor combined with anti-PD-L1 therapy to effectively prevent HCC angiogenesis and tumorigenesis in Gstz1-knockout mice, suggesting a potentially actionable strategy for HCC treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Patients with Down syndrome (DS, trisomy 21, T21) are at increased risk of transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (ML-DS). Both TAM and ML-DS require prenatal somatic mutations in GATA1, resulting in the truncated isoform GATA1s. The mechanism by which individual chromosome 21 (HSA21) genes synergize with GATA1s for leukemic transformation is challenging to study, in part due to limited human cell models with wild type GATA1 or GATA1s. HSA21-encoded DYRK1A is overexpressed in ML-DS and may be a therapeutic target. To determine how DYRK1A influences hematopoiesis in concert with GATA1s, we used gene editing to disrupt all 3 alleles of DYRK1A in isogenic T21 induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with and without the GATA1s mutation. Unexpectedly, hematopoietic differentiation revealed that DYRK1A loss combined with GATA1s leads to increased megakaryocyte proliferation and decreased maturation. This proliferative phenotype was associated with upregulation of D-type cyclins and hyperphosphorylation of Rb to allow E2F release and de-repression of its downstream targets. Notably, DYRK1A loss had no effect in T21/wtGATA1 megakaryocytes. These surprising results suggest that DYRK1A and GATA1 may synergistically restrain megakaryocyte proliferation in Trisomy 21 and that DYRK1A inhibition may not be a therapeutic option for GATA1s-associated leukemias.",

Reunion Island is a French department in the Indian Ocean. Due to the history of its settlement, the island's population has a wide variety of origins, and the population's sociodemographic characteristics differ from those of the French mainland. These characteristics make the island's population an original French population in its own right, particularly in terms of health. Cervical cancer incidence and mortality in Reunion Island are 10.4 per 100,000 and 4.4 per 100,000, respectively, both of which are much higher than those in mainland France. There is also a disparity in the prevalence of different HPV types, with types 33 and 52 being overrepresented and type 18 being underrepresented. However, vaccination and screening coverage in Reunion Island is low. It is important to understand the burden of infection and its risk factors in members of the young Reunionese population at risk of HPV infection to promote and evaluate the implementation of future vaccination and screening programs on a larger scale. The RUN-SurV-HPV study will have the following four objectives: (1) to describe the prevalence of HPV genotypes in a population at risk of sexually transmitted infections in Reunion Island; (2) to describe the prevalence of HPV genotypes by anatomical site, gender, and sexuality; (3) to describe the correlates and risk factors for HPV detection; and (4) to examine HPV genotypes between different anatomical sites. Cross-sectional analyses of 1200 routine vaginal, anal, pharyngeal, and urinary samples collected between October 2020 to December 2022 from female and male patients aged 16 to 30 years undergoing Chlamydia trachomatis testing at a sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing center at Reunion Island will be performed. The population included 333 women who all had vaginal and pharyngeal swabs, with 80 of them also having had an anal swab. There are 167 men who have sex with men who have had anal and pharyngeal swabs, and 120 men who have sex with women who have had a urine swab only. Results will be correlated with sociodemographic and clinical data collected routinely during the consultations. HPV detection and genotyping will be performed using the Anyplex II HPV28 detection assay (Seegene). The first polymerase chain reactions should begin in November 2023. The first results should be submitted for publication in 2024. The study will determine HPV prevalence by age, sex, male sexual preference, human immunodeficiency virus status, and STI co-infection. Collecting data from young patients not usually routinely screened for HPV infection will be a simple and reproducible way of better understanding local specificities, encouraging vaccination campaigns in the short-term, and evaluating their effectiveness in the future.

Disparity in CRC screening adherence was observed in populations of different socioeconomic status (SES), but the direction and strength of the association remained unclear. We aimed to systematically review all the observational studies that have analyzed the association between SES and adherence to organized CRC screening based on fecal occult blood tests. We systematically reviewed the studies in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science and reference lists of relevant reviews from the inception of the database up until June 7, 2023. Individual SES, neighborhood SES, and small-area SES were included, while any SES aggregated by geographic areas larger than neighbors were excluded. Studies assessing SES with any index or score combining indicators of income, education, deprivation, poverty, occupation, employment, marital status, cohabitation, and others were included. A random effect model meta-analysis was carried out for pooled odds ratios (ORs) and relative risks for adherence related to SES. Overall, 10 studies, with a total of 3,542,379 participants and an overall adherence rate of 64.9%, were included. Compared with low SES, high SES was associated with higher adherence (unadjusted OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.42-2.10; adjusted OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.28-1.82). In the subgroup of nonindividual-level SES, the adjusted association was significant (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.26-1.95). However, the adjusted association was insignificant in the subgroup of individual-level SES (OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.98-2.17). As for subgroups of the year of print, not only was the unadjusted association significantly stronger in the subgroup of early studies (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.59-2.44) than in the subgroup of late studies (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.31-1.56), but also the adjusted one was significantly stronger in the early group (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.43-2.42) than in the late group (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.14-1.39), which was consistent and robust. Despite being statistically insignificant, the strength of the association seemed lower in studies that did not adjust for race and ethnicity (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.21-1.43) than the overall estimate (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.28-1.82). The higher-SES population had higher adherence to fecal occult blood test-based organized CRC screening. Neighborhood SES, or small-area SES, was more competent than individual SES to be used to assess the association between SES and adherence. The disparity in adherence between the high SES and the low SES narrowed along with the development of interventions and the improvement of organized programs. Race and ethnicity were probably important confounding factors for the association.",

On multivariable analysis, factors associated with higher probability of tumor board burden included radiology or pathology specialty (PI, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54-0.79; P\u2009=\u2009.02), attending 3 or more hours per week of tumor boards (PI, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.58-0.76; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and having 2 or more children (PI, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.52-0.77; P\u2009=\u2009.03). Early or late tumor boards (before 8 am or at 5 pm or after) were considered very burdensome by 33 respondents (29.7%). Parents frequently reported a negative burden on childcare (43 of 77 [55.8%]) and family dynamics (49 of 77 [63.6%]). On multivariable analysis, a higher level of burden from early or late tumor boards was independently associated with identifying as a woman (PI, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57-0.78; P\u2009=\u2009.003) and having children (PI, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.84; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Independent assessment of 358 tumor boards from 22 institutions revealed the most common start time was before 8 am (88 [24.6%]). This survey study of tumor board burden suggests that identifying as a woman or parent was independently associated with a higher level of burden from early or late tumor boards. The burden of early or late tumor boards on childcare and family dynamics was commonly reported by parents. Having 2 or more children, attending 3 or more hours per week of tumor boards, and radiology or pathology specialty were associated with a significantly higher tumor board burden overall. Future strategies should aim to decrease the disparate burden on parents and women.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Survival Among Veterans Receiving Steroids for Immune-Related Adverse Events After Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy.",
        "AbstractText": "Systemic steroids are commonly used to manage immune-related adverse events (irAEs), but it remains unclear whether they may undermine immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy outcomes. Few studies have assessed the impact of steroid timing and its association with continuation or cessation of ICI therapy. To characterize how systemic steroids and steroid timing for irAEs are associated with survival in patients receiving ICI therapy. This multicenter retrospective cohort study encompassed veterans receiving ICI for cancer between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2021. Data analysis was conducted September 8, 2023. Identifiable primary diagnosis of cancer. Patients were categorized into 3 cohorts: those receiving no steroids, systemic steroids for irAEs, and steroids for non-irAE-associated reasons. All eligible patients received 1 or more doses of an ICI (atezolizumab, avelumab, cemiplimab, durvalumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab). Eligible patients in the steroid group received at least 1 dose (intravenous, intramuscular, or oral) of dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, prednisone, or prednisolone. Steroid use at baseline for palliation or infusion prophylaxis or delivered as a single dose was deemed to be non-irAE associated. All other patterns of steroid use were assumed to be for irAEs. The primary outcome was overall survival, with a 5-year follow-up after ICI initiation. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed with pairwise log-rank tests to determine significance. Risk was modeled with Cox proportional hazard regression. The cohort consisted of 20\u202f163 veterans receiving ICI therapy including 12\u202f221 patients (mean [SD] age, 69.5 [8.0] years; 11\u202f830 male patients [96.8%]; 9394 White patients [76.9%]) who received systemic steroids during ICI treatment and 7942 patients (mean [SD] age, 70.3 [8.5] years; 7747 male patients [97.5%]; 6085 White patients [76.6%]) who did not. Patients with an irAE diagnosis had significantly improved overall survival (OS) compared with those without (median [IQR] OS, 17.4 [6.6 to 48.5] months vs 10.5 [3.5 to 36.8] months; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81-0.84; P\u2009<\u2009.001). For patients with irAEs, systemic steroids for irAEs were associated with significantly improved survival compared with those who received steroids for non-irAE-related reasons or no steroid treatment (median [IQR] OS, 21.3 [9.3 to 58.2] months vs 13.6 [5.5 to 33.7] months vs 15.8 [4.9 to not reached] months; P <.001). However, among those who received steroids for irAEs, early steroid use (<2 months after ICI initiation) was associated with reduced relative survival benefit vs later steroid use, regardless of ICI continuation or cessation following steroid initiation (median [IQR] OS after ICI cessation 4.4 [1.9 to 19.5] months vs 16.0 [8.0 to 42.2] months; median [IQR] OS after ICI continuation, 16.0 [7.1 to not reached] months vs 29.2 [16.5 to 53.5] months; P <.001). This study suggests that steroids for irAE management may not abrogate irAE-associated survival benefits. However, early steroid administration within 2 months of ICI initiation is associated with shorter survival despite continuation of ICI therapy.",

        "AbstractText": "Pancreatic cancer patients have poor survival rates and are frequently treated using gemcitabine (Gem). However, initial tumor sensitivity often gives way to rapid development of resistance. Gem-based drug combinations are employed to increase efficacy and mitigate resistance, but our understanding of molecular-level drug interactions, which could assist in the development of more effective therapeutic regimens, is limited. Global quantitative proteomic analysis could provide novel mechanistic insights into drug combination interactions, but it is challenging to achieve high-quality quantitative proteomics analysis of the large sample sets that are typically required for drug combination studies. Here, we investigated molecular-level temporal interactions of Gem with BGJ398 (infigratinib), a recently approved pan-FGFR inhibitor, in multiple treatment groups (N = 42 samples) using IonStar, a robust large-scale proteomics method that employs well-controlled, ultrahigh-resolution MS1 quantification. A total of 5514 proteins in the sample set were quantified without missing data, requiring >2 unique peptides/protein, <1% protein false discovery rate (FDR), <0.1% peptide FDR, and CV < 10%. Functional analysis of the differentially altered proteins revealed drug-dysregulated processes such as metabolism, apoptosis, and antigen presentation pathways. These changes were validated experimentally using Seahorse metabolic assays and immunoassays. Overall, in-depth analysis of large-scale proteomics data provided novel insights into possible mechanisms by which FGFR inhibitors complement and enhance Gem activity in pancreatic cancers.",

        "AbstractText": "Adverse health impacts from outdoor air pollution occur across the U.S., but the magnitude of these impacts varies widely by geographic region. Ambient pollutant concentrations, emission sources, baseline health conditions, and population sizes and distributions are all important factors that need to be taken into account to quantify local health burdens. To determine health impacts from ambient air pollution concentrations in the U.S. that exceed recommended levels from the American Thoracic Society (ATS). Using a methodology that has been well established in previous \"Health of the Air\" reports, this study provides policy-relevant estimates for every monitored county and city in the U.S. for the adverse health impacts of outdoor pollution concentrations, using Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) design values for years 2018-2020. Additionally, for the first time, the report includes adverse birth outcomes as well as estimates of health impacts specifically attributable to wildland fires using an exposure dataset generated through Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) simulations. The adverse health burdens attributable to air pollution occur across the entire age spectrum, including adverse birth outcomes (10,660 preterm and/or low weight births; 95% CI: 3,180-18,330), in addition to mortality impacts (21,300 avoidable deaths; 95% CI: 16,150-26,200), lung cancer incidence (3,000 new cases; 95% CI: 1,550-4,390), multiple types of cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity (748,660 events; 95% CI: 326,050-1,057,080), and adversely impacted days (52.4 million days; 95% CI: 7.9-92.4 million). Two different estimates of mortality impacts from wildland fires were estimated based on assumptions regarding the underlying toxicity of particles from wildland fires (low estimate of 4,080 deaths, 95% CI: 240-7,890; middle estimate of 28,000 deaths, 95% CI: 27,300-28,700). Conclusions - This year's report identified sizable health benefits that are expected to occur across the U.S. from meeting more health-protective air quality standards such as those recommended by ATS. This study also indicates that a large number of excess deaths are attributable to emissions from wildland fires; air quality management strategies outside what is required by the Clean Air Act will be needed to best address this important source of air pollution and its associated health risks.

        "AbstractText": "Background: To investigate whether interleukin (IL)-6 could predict the post-operative complications of elective pancreatectomy early. Patients and Methods: Overall, 122 patients who underwent elective pancreatectomy from June 2020 to May 2021 in our hospital were enrolled. Interleukin-6 was measured on the day before and at six hours after surgery, and on post-operative day one, three, and five. The associations between IL-6 level and post-operative complications were analyzed, and the predictive value of IL-6 for complications was assessed. Results: Sixty-three patients developed post-operative complications. Higher IL-6 was observed in patients with post-operative complications on post-operative day one, post-operative day three, and post-operative day five, with odd ratios of 1.43, 1.68, and 2.54 (p\u2009=\u20090.01, p\u2009=\u20090.01, and p\u2009=\u20090.01), respectively. These trends were also observed in patients with infectious complications preoperatively, on post-operative day one, post-operative day three, and post-operative day five, with ORs of 2.46, 1.95, 2.01, and 2.49 (p\u2009=\u20090.00, 0.00, 0.01, 0.00) respectively. Multivariate regression revealed that IL-6 is the only predictor for infectious complications on post-operative day one (p\u2009=\u20090.016). Based on the optimal cutoffs, pre-operative IL-6, IL-6 on post-operative day one and post-operative day three for predicting infectious complications yielded area under the curve (AUC) of 0.73, 0.70, and 0.70, with high negative predictive value of 82.7%, 92.2%, and of 91.3%, respectively. Conclusions: This study validated the early predictive value of IL-6 on infectious complications after pancreatectomy. Because of the performance of serum IL-6 in predicting infectious complications and high NPV, we endorse that IL-6 could be a potential biomarker for early prediction and antibiotic optimization after pancreatectomy.",

ALK and ROS1 fusion proteins detection by immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been validated for rapid patient screening, but ROS1 fusions need to be confirmed by another technique and no RET IHC test is available for clinical use. We report herein the usefulness of the HTG EdgeSeq Assay, an RNA extraction-free test combining a quantitative nuclease protection assay with NGS, for the detection of ALK, ROS1 and RET fusions from 'real-life' small NSCLC samples. A total of 203 FFPE samples were collected from 11 centers. They included 143 rearranged NSCLC (87 ALK, 39 ROS1, 17 RET) and 60 ALK-ROS1-RET negative controls. The assay had a specificity of 98% and a sensitivity for ALK, ROS1 and RET fusions of 80%, 94% and 100% respectively. Among the 19 HTG-assay false negative samples, the preanalytical conditions were identified as the major factors impacting the assay efficiency. Overall, the HTG EdgeSeq assay offers comparable sensitivities and specificity than other RNA sequencing techniques, with the advantage that it can be used on very small and old samples collected multicentrically.",

        "AbstractText": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) can promote cell proliferation in prostate cancer (PCa). Full-length transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2-L) is highly expressed in PCa. However, the association between IL-6 and TRPM2-L in PCa is unclear. Here, human PCa cell lines, PC-3 and DU-145, were treated with 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) inhibitor, and the TRPM2-L protein expression in cells was significantly decreased. Cells were stably transfected with TRPM2 short-interfering RNA (siRNA) and cell survival clearly declined. Recombinant IL-6 treatment weakened the effects of TRPM2-siRNA on cell survival. TRPM2-L binds directly to IL-6R in PC-3 and DU-145 cells. The protein expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 was suppressed by reduction with TRPM2-L in PC-3 and DU-145 cells. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were indirectly cocultured with PCa cells, and the invasion and angiogenic activity of HUVECs were enhanced after coculture with PCa cells. However, TRPM2-L reduction in PCa cells significantly decreased the invasion and angiogenic activity of HUVECs compared to the control coculture. In vivo, xenograft tumors were induced using PC-3 cells. Tocilizumab treatment or TRPM2-L reduction clearly suppressed tumor growth. Meanwhile, the injection of mouse recombinant IL-6 weakened the antitumor effects of TRPM2-L reduction. These data demonstrate that the IL-6/TRPM2-L axis in PCa tumor growth is important, and interference of the IL-6/TRPM2-L axis may be a novel approach for PCa therapy.",

It attracts tremendous attention for the precise and efficient treatment of local tumors with stimuli-responsive nanomaterials, which enhance RT. However, there are few systematic reviews summarizing the newly emerging stimuli-responsive mechanisms and strategies used for tumor radio-sensitization. Hence, this review provides a comprehensive overview of recently reported studies on stimuli-responsive nanomaterials for radio-sensitization. It includes four different approaches for sensitized RT, namely endogenous response, exogenous response, dual stimuli-response, and multi stimuli-response. Endogenous response involves various stimuli such as pH, hypoxia, GSH, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and enzymes. On the other hand, exogenous response encompasses X-ray, light, and ultrasound. Dual stimuli-response combines pH/enzyme, pH/ultrasound, and ROS/light. Lastly, multi stimuli-response involves the combination of pH/ROS/GSH and X-ray/ROS/GSH. By elaborating on these responsive mechanisms and applying them to clinical RT diagnosis and treatment, these methods can enhance radiosensitive efficiency and minimize damage to surrounding normal tissues. Finally, this review discusses the additional challenges and perspectives related to stimuli-responsive nanomaterials for tumor radio-sensitization.",

While previous studies have evaluated the prognostic value of US features, results have been inconsistent. Purpose To determine if US features can help predict tumor progression in patients with low-risk PTMC undergoing AS. Materials and Methods This prospective study enrolled 1177 participants with PTMC from three hospitals between June 2016 and January 2021. Participants were self-assigned to either immediate surgery or AS, and those with two or more US examinations in the absence of surgery were included in the analysis. A \u03c72 test was used to compare estimated tumor progression rate at 4 years between participants stratified according to US features. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to assess the association of clinical and US features with overall tumor progression and specific progression criteria. Results Among 699 participants included in the analysis, 68 (mean age, 49 years \u00b1 12 [SD]; 40 female participants) showed tumor progression (median follow-up, 41.4 months \u00b1 16 [SD]). Tumor progression was associated with the US features of diffuse thyroid disease (DTD) (hazard ratio [HR], 2.3 [95% CI: 1.4, 3.7]; P = .001) and intratumoral vascularity (HR, 1.7 [95% CI: 1.0, 3.0]; P = .04) and the participant characteristics of male sex (HR, 2.8 [95% CI: 1.7, 4.6]; P < .001), age less than 30 years (HR, 2.9 [95% CI: 1.2, 6.8]; P = .01), and thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 7 \u00b5U/mL or higher (HR, 6.9 [95% CI: 2.7, 17.4]; P < .001). The risk of tumor progression was higher for participants with DTD (14%, P = .001) or intratumoral vascularity (14%, P = .02) than for participants without these features (6%). DTD and intratumoral vascularity were associated with tumor enlargement (HR, 2.7 [95% CI: 1.4, 5.1]; P = .002) and new lymph node metastasis (HR, 5.0 [95% CI: 1.3, 19.4]; P = .02), respectively.

His past medical history included right radical nephroureterectomy for ureteral cancer in 2016, transurethral resection of a bladder tumor in 2015, and tuberculous pleurisy in his third decade of life that was complicated by a chronic calcified empyema (Fig 1C). He had been doing well clinically until 6 months prior, when he presented to an outside hospital with progressive right-sided chest pain and dyspnea and was found to have active tuberculosis. During that hospitalization, he underwent chest CT and CT-guided biopsy of an incidentally found thoracic lesion (Fig 2), which revealed chronic active inflammation. His symptoms improved after initiation of antituberculous medication, and he was discharged home to complete treatment. Because of interval growth of this lesion noted on a subsequent surveillance CT scan, he was referred to pulmonology for further evaluation. Laboratory tests obtained during his visit revealed mild leukocytosis (1258 cells \u00d7 109/L; normal range, 4000-10\u2009000 cells \u00d7 109/L) with neutrophilic predominance (82% neutrophils; normal range, 50%-75% neutrophils), and a mildly elevated C-reactive protein level (3.17 mg/dL; normal range, 0-0.5 mg/dL).

A special focus on the key functional properties of SNPs is discussed which makes them an attractive material in the field of onco-nanomedicine. Strategies to overcome the BBB using SNPs are analyzed. Furthermore, recent advancements in active targeting, combination therapies, and innovative nanotherapeutics utilizing SNPs are discussed. Safety considerations, toxicity profiles, and regulatory aspects are addressed to provide an understanding of SNPs' translational potential. SNPs have tremendous prospects in brain cancer research. The multifunctionality of SNPs has the potential to overcome both the BBB and BTB limitations and can be used for brain cancer imaging, drug delivery, and theranostics.

        "AbstractText": "Objective is to quantify benefit-risk tradeoffs pertaining to potential gene therapies among adults and parents/caregivers of children with sickle-cell disease (SCD). A discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey was developed in which respondents selected their preferred treatment alternatives in a series of experimentally-controlled pairs of hypothetical gene therapies and a \"no gene therapy\" option. Gene therapy alternatives were defined based on the chance of eliminating SCD symptoms, expected increases in life expectancy they could offer, treatment-related risk of death and potential increases in lifetime cancer risk. Respondents made selections based on their current disease severity and in the context of expectations of worsened disease. Three clinical sites and one patient organization recruited 174 adult patients and 109 parents of children with SCD to complete the survey. Adult and parent respondents were generally willing to choose gene therapies, but the adults required higher expected levels of efficacy (i.e., higher chance of eliminating symptoms) than parents to choose gene therapies that conferred mortality risks of 10% or more. When adults and parents of children with less severe symptoms were asked to consider scenarios of higher levels of disease severity, the risk tolerance increased, and the lowest acceptable level of efficacy for gene therapies with mortality risks dropped by more than 50%. Baseline SCD symptoms are a major driver of gene therapy acceptability. Adults and parents of patients with milder symptoms may prefer other treatment options; however, an expectation of symptoms deterioration triggers strong reassessment of the acceptable benefit-risk balance of this novel technology.",

        "AbstractText": "Cellular apoptosis is a central mechanism leveraged by chemotherapy to treat human cancers. 5-Methylcytosine (m5C) modifications installed on both DNA and mRNA are documented to regulate apoptosis independently. However, the interplay or crosstalk between them in cellular apoptosis has not yet been explored. Here, we reported that promoter methylation by DNMT1 coordinated with mRNA methylation by NSun2 to regulate osteosarcoma cell apoptosis. DNMT1 was induced during osteosarcoma cell apoptosis triggered by chemotherapeutic drugs, whereas NSun2 expression was suppressed. DNMT1 was found to repress NSun2 expression by methylating the NSun2 promoter. Moreover, DNMT1 and NSun2 regulate the anti-apoptotic genes AXL, NOTCH2, and YAP1 through DNA and mRNA methylation, respectively. Upon exposure to cisplatin or doxorubicin, DNMT1 elevation drastically reduced the expression of these anti-apoptotic genes via enhanced promoter methylation coupled with NSun2 ablation-mediated attenuation of mRNA methylation, thus rendering osteosarcoma cells to apoptosis. Collectively, our findings establish crosstalk of importance between DNA and RNA cytosine methylations in determining osteosarcoma resistance to apoptosis during chemotherapy, shedding new light on future treatment of osteosarcoma, and adding additional layers to the control of gene expression at different epigenetic levels.",

        "AbstractText": "We present the results for CAPRI Round 54, the 5th joint CASP-CAPRI protein assembly prediction challenge. The Round offered 37 targets, including 14 homodimers, 3 homo-trimers, 13 heterodimers including 3 antibody-antigen complexes, and 7 large assemblies. On average ~70 CASP and CAPRI predictor groups, including more than 20 automatics servers, submitted models for each target. A total of 21\u2009941 models submitted by these groups and by 15 CAPRI scorer groups were evaluated using the CAPRI model quality measures and the DockQ score consolidating these measures. The prediction performance was quantified by a weighted score based on the number of models of acceptable quality or higher submitted by each group among their five best models. Results show substantial progress achieved across a significant fraction of the 60+ participating groups. High-quality models were produced for about 40% of the targets compared to 8% two years earlier. This remarkable improvement is due to the wide use of the AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold2-Multimer software and the confidence metrics they provide. Notably, expanded sampling of candidate solutions by manipulating these deep learning inference engines, enriching multiple sequence alignments, or integration of advanced modeling tools, enabled top performing groups to exceed the performance of a standard AlphaFold2-Multimer version used as a yard stick. This notwithstanding, performance remained poor for complexes with antibodies and nanobodies, where evolutionary relationships between the binding partners are lacking, and for complexes featuring conformational flexibility, clearly indicating that the prediction of protein complexes remains a challenging problem.",

        "AbstractText": "The biological role and prognostic value of thrombospondin domain-containing 7A (THSD7A) in gastric cancer remain unclear. Our purpose was to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the functioning of THSD7A and its prognostic value in gastric cancer. Gastric cancer-associated single cell and bulk RNA sequencing data obtained from two databases, were analyzed. We used bulk RNA sequencing to examine the differential expression of THSD7A in gastric cancer and normal gastric tissues and explored the relationship between THSD7A expression and clinicopathological characteristics. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox analyses revealed the prognostic value of THSD7A. Gene set enrichment and immune infiltration analyses were used to determine the cancer-promoting mechanisms of THSD7A and its effect on the immune microenvironment. We explored the relationship between THSD7A expression and sensitivity of anti-tumor drugs and immune checkpoint levels. Biological functions of THSD7A were validated at single-cell and in vitro levels. THSD7A expression was significantly increased in gastric cancer samples. High THSD7A expression was associated with poor clinical phenotypes and prognoses. Cox analysis showed that THSD7A was an independent risk factor for patients with gastric cancer. Enrichment analysis suggested that epithelial-mesenchymal transition and inflammatory responses may be potential pro-cancer mechanisms of THSD7A. Upregulation of THSD7A promoted infiltration by M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells. High THSD7A expression suppressed the sensitivity of patients with gastric cancer to drugs, such as 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, and cisplatin, and upregulated immune checkpoints, such as HAVCR2, PDCD1LG2, TIGIT, and CTLA4. At the single cell level, THSD7A was an endothelial cell-associated gene and endothelial cells overexpressing THSD7A showed unique pro-oncogenic effects. In vitro experiments confirmed that THSD7A was overexpressed in gastric cancer samples and cells, and that knocking out THSD7A significantly inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion. THSD7A overexpression may be a unique prognostic marker and therapeutic target in gastric cancer. Therefore, our study provides a new perspective on the precise treatment of gastric cancer.",

A growing study confirms that microRNAs (miRNAs) are significantly important in breast cancer, especially TNBC. This research was carried out to examine the function of miR-106b-5p in CDDP resistance of TNBC as well as the downstream mechanism. The miR-106b-5p and growth-differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) expressions in the tissues from TNBC patients and CDDP-treated TNBC cell lines were measured by RT-qPCR. Thereafter, cell proliferation and migration in the presence of CDDP treatment were evaluated via CCK-8 and Transwell assays in the TNBC cells. A xenograft mice model was also established to verify the miR-106b-5p silencing effect on the growth of CDDP resistance TNBC cells in vivo. Luciferase reporter experiments were performed to predict the relationship between miR-106b-5p and GDF11 expression. The results showed that miR-106b-5p was upregulated in the TNBC tumor cells and TNBC cells treated with CDDP and knockdown of this caused inhibition of the TNBC cell lines' proliferation, migration and suppressed the growth of the TNBC xenografted tumors, in the presence of CDDP treatment. In addition, it was observed that miR-106b-5p can bind to GDF11; as a result in the TNBC tissues and CDDP-treated TNBC cell lines the down-regulation of GDF11 was observed. Moreover, GDF11 silencing promoted CDDP-treated TNBC cell lines' proliferation and migration and reversed the interference effect of miR-106b-5p. MiR-106b-5p was upregulated in TNBC and this upregulation may promote CDDP resistance of the TNBC cells by targeting GDF11 and inhibiting its expression.",

However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of XCL2 protein in various disease conditions, particularly cancer, remain poorly understood. Bioinformatics was used to detect the expression of XCL2, the relationship between survival time and XCL2 in BLCA patients, the mutational status of XCL2, the role of XCL2 in the tumor immune microenvironment, and the sensitivity of XCL2-targeted drugs in 33 cancers. In vitro experiments were conducted to investigate the chemotactic effects of XCL2 expression on M1-type macrophages in human specimens and in isolated cancer cells. XCL2 expression was downregulated in tumor tissues and closely associated with the prognosis of human cancers. Furthermore, XCL2 affects DNA methylation, tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and mismatch repair (MMR) in human cancers. The expression level of XCL2 significantly correlated with infiltrated immune cells, immunological pathways, and other immune markers. More importantly, we found that XCL2 was positively associated with T lymphocytes and macrophages in the transcriptome and single-cell sequencing data. Using multiple immunofluorescence staining, we found that the expression level of XCL2 was upregulated in many cells in pan-cancer samples, and the number of M1 macrophage marker CD68 and INOS-positive cells increased. 786O, U251, and MDA-MB-231 cells could recruit more M1 macrophages in vitro after overexpressing XCL2.

        "AbstractText": "Virgin coconut oil (VCNO), an unrefined kernel oil from Cocos nucifera L., has considerable medicinal and nutritive value. Experimental evidence suggests its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, chemoprotective, analgesic, and hypolipidemic effects. Presently, the effect of VCNO on ameliorating dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced inflammatory bowel disease and cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced immunosuppression in experimental animals was analyzed. DSS (4%) was administered to BALB/c mice through drinking water for 12\u2009days to induce inflammatory bowel disease, and VCNO (500, 750, and 1000\u2009mg/kg bwt) was supplemented orally for 12\u2009days. For anti-inflammatory studies, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 250\u2009\u00b5g/animal) was injected into the intraperitoneal cavity of Swiss albino mice followed by 7\u2009days' pretreatment of VCNO (500, 750, and 1000\u2009mg/kg bwt). To understand the mechanism of action, serum from all animals was collected after 6\u2009hours of LPS challenge and levels of proinflammatory cytokines were analyzed using enzyme-inked immunosorbent assay. In addition to this, immunosuppression was induced by CTX (50\u2009mg/kg bwt, po) in Swiss albino mice. Oral administration of VCNO effectively reversed the pathologies associated with inflammatory bowel disease induced by DSS, including loss of body weight, increased disease activity index, shortening of colon length, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. Histopathological examination showed that VCNO restored the damage in colon tissue induced by DSS. Similar trends were noticed in levels of myeloperoxidase and mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines in colon tissue. In addition to this, supplementation of VCNO markedly reduced the hike in the level of serum proinflammatory cytokines in LPS-challenged mice. Further, administration of VCNO effectively increased spleen and thymus indexes and stimulated the production of interferon-\u03b3 in serum. Overall, this study revealed that VCNO alleviates inflammatory bowel disease and inflammation; concurrently, it can revert immunosuppression.",

The relationship between PP and lung function is not well understood, whereas the time-consuming nature of PP delineation to obtain volume impedes research. To automate the laborious task of delineation, we aimed to develop automatic artificial intelligence (AI)-driven segmentation of PP. Moreover, we aimed to explore the relationship between pleural plaque volume (PPV) and pulmonary function tests. Radiologists manually delineated PPs retrospectively in computed tomography (CT) images of patients with occupational exposure to asbestos (May 2014 to November 2019). We trained an AI model with a no-new-UNet architecture. The Dice Similarity Coefficient quantified the overlap between AI and radiologists. The Spearman correlation coefficient (r) was used for the correlation between PPV and pulmonary function test metrics. When recorded, these were vital capacity (VC), forced vital capacity (FVC), and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). We trained the AI system on 422 CT scans in 5 folds, each time with a different fold (n = 84 to 85) as a test set. On these independent test sets combined, the correlation between the predicted volumes and the ground truth was r = 0.90, and the median overlap was 0.71 Dice Similarity Coefficient. We found weak to moderate correlations with PPV for VC (n = 80, r = -0.40) and FVC (n = 82, r = -0.38), but no correlation for DLCO (n = 84, r = -0.09). When the cohort was split on the median PPV, we observed statistically significantly lower VC (P = 0.001) and FVC (P = 0.04) values for the higher PPV patients, but not for DLCO (P = 0.19). We successfully developed an AI algorithm to automatically segment PP in CT images to enable fast volume extraction. Moreover, we have observed that PPV is associated with loss in VC and FVC.",

Hyperuricemia or hypouricemia can cause multiple dysfunctions throughout the biological processes. Consequently, there is a pressing need for monitoring UA concentration in body fluid. While clinical methods are known, the availability of a point-of-care testing (PoCT) kit remains conspicuously absent. In the case of electrochemical recognition of UA, the oxidation potential of ascorbic acid closely aligns with that of UA and thus it hinders the detection process, which eventually may result in false positive signals. Several chemosensors are known in the field of supramolecular chemistry, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are one of the best-performing contenders due to their robustness, stability, and versatile structures. In this review, we tried to unbox the up-to-date development of UA sensing by MOFs. We delve into the state of UA recognition by MOFs, exploring both electrochemical and fluorometric pathways and drawing comparisons with structurally similar probes like covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to understand/establish the advantages of MOFs specifically in UA sensing. In the absence of a PoCT kit, we have provided the conceptual outlook for designing a PoCT device termed a \"Urimeter\" via electrochemical operation. For the first time, we have proposed different methods of how UA sensing can be tied up with artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI-ML).",

So far, however, little is known about cancer patients' expectations of ACP that lead to acceptance or refusal of the programme. The\u00a0presented study, therefore, aims to explore cancer patients' expectations of ACP. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposeful sample of 27 cancer patients consenting to or refusing a newly implemented ACP programme in a German university hospital. Data were analysed using typological content analysis. We identified five different expectation clusters in relation to ACP. Consenting participants held expectations about the impact of ACP that were either 'ego-centred' or 'family-centred'. Refusers had expectations based on ignorance and misinformation, or-if they had already completed an advance directive-expectations to avoid unpleasant redundancy, perceiving no additional benefit but a burden from ACP. Finally, refusers in particular expressed expectations of delegated responsibility at the end of life, including anticipation of proxy decision-making. Our study results suggest that expectation-modifying measures could be taken to positively influence cancer patients' expectations and thus the acceptance of ACP. In this respect, reducing ignorance and misguided expectations plays a decisive role. Especially in family constellations with expected delegation of responsibility and dependence at the end of life, it might be important to promote ACP as a family-intervention to improve family outcomes.",

In this study, we demonstrated a comparative study of the effect of polyphenolic carbon quantum dots (CQDs) on in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy. Dual emissive (green and yellow) shape specific polyphenolic CQDs (G-CQDs and Y-CQDs) were synthesized from easily available nontoxic precursors (phloroglucinol), and the antitumor property of the as-synthesized probe was investigated as compared to round-shaped blue emissive CQDs (B-CQDs) derived from well-reported precursor citric acid and urea. The B-CQDs had a nuclei-targeting property, and G-CQDs and Y-CQDs had mitochondria-targeting properties. We have found that the polyphenol containing CQDs (at a dose of 100 \u03bcg mL-1) specifically attack mitochondria by excess accumulation, altering the metabolism, inhibiting branching pattern, imbalanced Bax/Bcl-2 homeostasis, and ultimately generating oxidative stress levels, leading to oxidative stress-induced cell death in cancer cells in vitro. We show that G-CQDs are the main cause of oxidative stress in cancer cells because of their ability to produce sufficient \u2022OH- and 1O2 radicals, evidenced by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and a terephthalic acid test. Moreover, the near-infrared absorption properties of the CQDs were exhibited in two-photon (TP) emission, which was utilized for TP cellular imaging of cancer cells without photobleaching. The in vivo antitumor test further discloses that intratumoral injection of G-CQDs can significantly augment the treatment efficacy of subcutaneous tumors without any adverse effects on BalB/c nude mice.

Two enantiomers, (1S,2S)- d-NMAPPD and (1R,2R)- d-NMAPPD (LCL4), were characterized by various methods (1 H and 13 C NMR, UHPLC, high-resolution mass spectra, circular dichroism) and evaluated for the ability to bind to N-myristoyltransferase 1 (NMT1) using computational docking analysis. structure-activity relationship analysis of these compounds led to the synthesis of (1R,2R)-LCL204 and evaluation as a potential NMT1 inhibitor utilizing the purified full length NMT1 enzyme. The NMT inhibitory activity wase determined by Click chemistry and immunoblotting. Regulation of NMT1 on tumor growth was evaluated in a xenograft tumor model. (1R,2R)- d-NMAPPD, but not its enantiomer (1S,2S)- d-NMAPPD, inhibited NMT1 activity and reduced AR protein levels.

This study revealed that the MIR938 rs2505901 T>C polymorphism may be a potential risk factor for neuroblastoma in Chinese children. In the long term, conducting large and diverse sample studies from different ethnicities will indeed be crucial in determining the role of MIR938 polymorphisms in NB risk. By including individuals from various ethnic backgrounds, researchers can account for potential genetic variations that may exist between populations.",

        "AbstractText": "Previous reports have shown a potential causal impact of vasectomy on prostate cancer (PCa). The objective of this study was to investigate the association between vasectomy and PCa, while evaluating the influence of confounding factors such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening and body mass index (BMI). Mendelian randomization (MR) study using summary statistics from genome-wide associations of vasectomy (462,933 European ancestry), ever had PSA test (200,410 European ancestry), time since last PSA test (46,104 European ancestry), BMI (152,893 European males) and PCa (79,148 cases, 61,106 controls, European ancestry). This study was conducted using summary statistic data from large, previously described cohorts. Data analyses were conducted from November 2022 to June 2023. Genetic liability to vasectomy was not associated with PCa (OR\u2009=\u20090.07, 95% CI: 2.95\u2009   \u00d7  $\\times $  \u200910-3 , 1.54, p\u2009=\u20090.09).

        "AbstractText": "Cancer survivors with ostomies face complex challenges. This study compared the Ostomy Self-Management Telehealth program (OSMT) versus attention control usual care (UC). Three academic centers randomized participants. OSMT group sessions were led by ostomy nurses and peer ostomates (three for ostomates-only, one for support persons, and one review session for both). Surveys at baseline, OSMT completion, and 6 months were primary outcome patient activation (PAM), self-efficacy (SE), City of Hope quality of life-Ostomy (COH-O), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Surveys were scored per guidelines for those completing at least two surveys. Linear mixed effects models were used to select potential covariates for the final model and to test the impact of OSMT within each timeframe. A total of 90 OSMT and 101 UC fulfilled analysis criteria. Arms were well-matched but types of tumors were unevenly distributed (p\u00a0=\u00a0.023). The OSMT arm had a nonsignificant improvement in PAM (confidence interval [CI], -3.65 to 5.3]; 4.0 vs. 2.9) at 6 months. There were no significant differences in other surveys. There was a significant OSMT benefit for urinary tumors (four SE domains). Higher OSMT session attendance was associated with post-session improvements in five SE domains (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05), two COH-O domains (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05), and HADS anxiety (p\u00a0=\u00a0.01). At 6 months, there remained improvements in one SE domain (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05), one COH-O domain (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05), and HADS anxiety (p\u00a0<\u00a0.01). No clear benefit was seen for the OSMT intervention, although there may be an advantage based on type of tumor. Benefit with greater session attendance was also encouraging. Cancer patients with ostomies have many challenges. We tested a telehealth curriculum compared to usual care.

We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library from 1990 to December 2021 to identify prospective studies, i.e. nested case-control or case-cohort studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized to validate the relationship between H. pylori infection and GC. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed and random-effects meta-analyses by subgroup were performed. A total of 27 studies were included. H. pylori infection was strongly associated with non-cardia gastric cancer (NCGC) both in Europe/North America (OR\u2009=\u20095.37, 95%CI:4.39-6.57) and in Asia (OR\u2009=\u20092.50, 95%CI:1.89-3.32). H. pylori infection was also positively associated with cardia gastric cancer (CGC) in Asia (OR\u2009=\u20091.74, 95%CI:1.38-2.19), but not in European/American populations, where the association was inverse (OR\u2009=\u20090.64, 95%CI: 0.51 to 0.79). Furthermore, the strength of association was greater in studies that detected H. pylori by immunoblotting in comparison to ELISA, both for NCGC and for CGC in Asia, and also in studies testing for H. pylori detection further back in time prior to cancer diagnosis (Ptrend <0.05). Approximately 79% of NCGC in Asia, 87% of NCGC in Europe/North America, and 62% of CGC in Asia could be attributable to H. pylori infection. This meta-analysis summarizes prospective evidence for the association between H. pylori infection and GC, providing robust estimates for the attributable risk and potential impact of H. pylori-targeting GC prevention programs.

In this study, we have examined MT nucleation sites in two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, with the hypothesis that only the migratory invasive MDA-MB-231 cells exhibit MTs originating from the Golgi. MTs were disassembled and allowed to slightly regrow so individual nucleation sites could then be observed via fluorescently tagged antibodies (\u03b1-tubulin, cis-Golgi marker GM130, and EB1-a MT plus-end binding protein) and confocal microscopy. To determine if MT nucleation at the Golgi is more apparent during active migration compared to when cells are stationary, cells were treated with the chemoattractant epidermal growth factor (EGF) and examined for colocalizations between the Golgi, \u03b1-tubulin, and \u03b3-tubulin. Images were analyzed qualitatively for color overlap, and quantitatively using Manders Colocalization Coefficients. Differences between groups were tested for significance using one-way analysis of variances and Tukey's post hoc test. Significantly higher colocalization values (coloc) in the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells (\u03b1-tubulin coloc GM130\u2009=\u20090.39, GM130 coloc \u03b1-tubulin\u2009=\u20090.82, GM130 coloc EB1\u2009=\u20090.24, and EB1 coloc GM130\u2009=\u20090.38) compared to the weakly invasive MCF-7 cells (0.15, 0.08, 0.02, and 0.16, respectively) were observed. EGF-treated cells exhibited higher colocalization values than control cells for three of the four protein combinations tested, but EGF-treated MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited significantly higher values (\u03b1-tubulin coloc GM130\u2009=\u20090.20, GM130 coloc \u03b1-tubulin\u2009= 0.89, and \u03b3-tubulin coloc GM130\u2009=\u20090.47) than both control groups as well as the EGF-treated MCF-7 cells. Results support the hypothesis that MT nucleation at the Golgi occurs more frequently in the invasive MDA-MB-231 cell line compared to the weakly invasive MCF-7 cells.

The Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) was initially introduced for locally advanced and inflammatory BC patients to allow a less extensive surgical resection, whereas now it represents the current standard for early-stage and operable BC. However, only 20%-40% of patients achieve pathologic complete response (pCR). According to the results of practice-changing clinical trials, the addition of trastuzumab to NAC brings improvements to pCR, and recently, the use of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab has registered further statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in terms of pCR. The goal of our work is to propose a machine learning model to predict the pCR to NAC in HER2-positive patients based on a subset of clinical features. First, we evaluated the significant association of clinical features with pCR on the retrospectively collected data referred to 67 patients afferent to Istituto Tumori \"Giovanni Paolo II.\" Then, we performed a feature selection procedure to identify a subset of features to be used for training a machine learning-based classification algorithm. As a result, pCR to NAC was associated with ER status, Pgr status, and HER2 score. The machine learning model trained on a subgroup of essential features reached an AUC of 73.27% (72.44%-73.66%) and an accuracy of 71.67% (71.64%-73.13%). According to our results, the clinical features alone are not enough to define a support system useful for clinical pathway.

A search query was designed to search for articles in the PubMed database comparing FNA and FNB for biopsy of pancreatic lesions, and detailed data were extracted from selected studies.

In this paper, we chose 4 papers out of 407 of them through a strict selection process. In this trial, there were 1027 surgical cases of oesophagus carcinoma, 152 with PEG pre-surgery and 875 without PEG. The total sample size ranged from 14 to 657. Two studies showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of postoperative wound infection among PEG and No-PEG(OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.38, 2.80 p\u2009=\u20090.96), there was no statistical significance in the likelihood of anastomotic leak among PEG after surgery compared to No-PEG in 4 trials (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.62-2.07 p\u2009=\u20090.69), and there were no statistical differences between PEG and No-PEG before operation on anastomotic stricture for esophagectomy(OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.31-1.56 p\u2009=\u20090.38). No wound or anastomosis complications were observed in the PEG group. Thus, PEG preoperatively is an effective and safe procedure without any harmful influence on gastrointestinal structure or anastomosing. It can be applied to patients with oesophagus carcinoma who have a high risk of undernutrition. Nevertheless, because of the limited number of randomized controlled trials in this meta-analysis, caution should be exercised in their treatment.

In total, 511 cases of ccRCC and 77 cases of nccRCC were treated with pharmacotherapy. After excluding the patients who received cytokine therapy, chemotherapy, or others, there were 391 ccRCC patients and 60 nccRCC patients who were treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and 7 ccRCC patients and 7 nccRCC patients who were treated with mammalian-target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORIs). In addition, 132 ccRCC patients and 16 nccRCC patients received nivolumab. There was no significant difference in IMDC risk classification before first-line therapy between ccRCC and nccRCC groups, or in each subgroup within the nccRCC group. TTF for TKIs (161 days, 95% CI: 75-212 days) and mTORIs (21 days, 95% CI: 9-31 days) didn't differ significantly between nccRCC and ccRCC groups (205 days, 95% CI: 174-243 days and 33 days, 95% CI: 8-113 days, respectively).

Specifically, it recognizes methylation marks deposited by protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), which is also known to promote tumorigenesis. Although SND1 can drive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it is unclear whether the SND1 Tudor domain is needed to promote HCC. We sought to identify the biological role of the SND1 Tudor domain in normal and tumorigenic settings by developing two genetically engineered SND1 mouse models, an Snd1 knockout (Snd1 KO) and an Snd1 Tudor domain-mutated (Snd1 KI) mouse, whose mutant SND1 can no longer recognize PRMT5-catalyzed methylarginine marks. Quantitative PCR analysis of normal, KO, and KI liver samples revealed a role for the SND1 Tudor domain in regulating expression of genes encoding major acute phase proteins, which could provide mechanistic insight into SND1 function in a tumor setting. Prior studies indicated that ectopic overexpression of SND1 in the mouse liver dramatically accelerates the development of diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC. Thus, we tested the combined effects of DEN and SND1 loss or mutation on the development of HCC. We found that both Snd1 KO and Snd1 KI mice were partially protected against malignant tumor development following exposure to DEN. These results support the development of small molecule inhibitors that target the SND1 Tudor domain or the use of upstream PRMT5 inhibitors, as novel treatments for HCC.",

A few studies address skin moisture changes during RT for head and neck cancer. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of moisturized skin care (MSC) on severity of RD. The study includes newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients undergoing RT. Participants were divided into MSC group and routine skin care (RSC) group based on patient's preferred decision. Skin moisture in the four quadrants of the neck was measured weekly before and after RT. RD was assessed with the Radiation Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale (RISRAS) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) acute skin toxicity grading criteria. A total of 54 patients were enrolled, of which 49 patients were suitable for the statistical analysis. There was a statistically significant difference in the RISRAS total score since the 5th week after RT between the groups. The severity of RD was less (B=0.814, p=0.021) and the onset was later (B=-0.384, p=0.006) in the MSC group when compared to the RSC group. Skin moisture decreased with cumulative radiation dose. In the upper neck, the MSC group had a slower rate of skin moisture decrease compared to the RSC group (right upper neck: B=0.935, p=0.007; left upper neck: B=0.93, p=0.018). MSC can effectively reduce the severity and delay the onset of RD, while slows down skin moisture decrease during RT.",

This study included 258 patients who underwent curative treatment for gastric cancer between 2005 and 2020. The prognosis and clinicopathological parameters between the high- and low-PLR statuses were analyzed. The overall survival (OS) stratified by each clinical factor was compared using the log-rank test, and a significant difference was observed using a pretreatment PLR of 150. When comparing the patient backgrounds between the high-PLR (PLR\u2265150) and low-PLR (PLR<150) groups, there were no significant differences between the two groups. The OS rates at 3 and 5 years after surgery were significantly higher at 70.8% and 60.4%, respectively, for the high-PLR group than at 83.6% and 79.7%, respectively, for the low-PLR group. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the OS showed that the PLR was a significant prognostic factor. In addition, when comparing the first recurrence sites, there were significant differences in peritoneal recurrence. The PLR is a significant risk factor for gastric cancer, making it a promising prognostic factor for patients with gastric cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "A pharyngeal fistula is the most common complication of total laryngectomy; thus, accurate diagnosis and treatment are important. Diagnosis is usually made by the finding of leakage of the contrast agent outside the pharynx during swallowing contrast examination. Herein, we encountered a case in which fine leaks not detected on contrast examination during swallowing were visualized and diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) imaging with oral contrast media with the patient in a prone position. During imaging in a prone position, the contrast agent entered the sutures on the cephalocaudal and ventral sides of the surgical site, which were particularly prone to leaks due to gravity, and it was possible to diagnose minute leaks. When there is a high risk of postoperative pharyngeal fistula, such as in reconstructive cases with a pedunculated flap or with overlapping risk factors such as preoperative irradiation, CT imaging with contrast medium in a prone position is considered useful when swallowing contrast examination does not provide a clear diagnosis. However, suture failure is possible, and this should be evaluated. This case suggests that routine prone CT may lead to the early detection of postoperative pharyngeal fistula in high-risk cases. Further accumulation of cases is required to confirm our findings.",

Patients were classified into two groups using a cutoff blood level of 155 ng/ml. The primary endpoint was the relationship between Osimertinib exposure and efficacy, and secondary endpoints were the relationship between Osimertinib exposure and side effects, and the effect of covariates on efficacy and blood levels. The median progression-free survival (PFS) for evaluable patients in the steady-state trough concentration (Cmin ss) \u2265155 ng/ml and Cmin ss <155 ng/ml groups was 18.7 months and 31.2 months.

Immediate reconstruction using autologous tissue must be performed following glossectomy for tongue cancer to improve patient quality of life. This study aimed to demonstrate the usefulness of a surgical technique using the free vertical latissimus dorsi flap (FvLDF) for tongue reconstructions using autologous tissue. Among patients who underwent total glossectomy for tongue cancer from November 2014 to February 2023, we selected 10 patients who underwent immediate tongue reconstruction with a radial free forearm flap (RFFF) or free anterolateral thigh flap and four patients who underwent FvLDF. The patients were compared regarding postoperative function (width of oropharyngeal space in computed tomography, language-speech evaluation), aesthetic results, and features. All four patients who underwent FvLDF showed successful flap survival, with no severe complications. Because vertical incision was made during flap harvest with primary closure possible with the mid-axillary line, donor morbidity was significantly lower in patients who underwent reconstruction with FvLDF than in those who underwent reconstruction with RFFF, and good aesthetic results were obtained. In comparing the oropharyngeal space of patients on neck CT preoperatively and postoperatively, the width increase rate of patients who underwent reconstruction with FvLDF was significantly smaller. FvLDF patients demonstrated good speech and swallowing functions. Considering the advantages of reconstruction with FvLDF in terms of features and aesthetic results, this surgical technique may be a reliable alternative technique for tongue defects after glossectomy.",

Sternotomy is a highly invasive procedure, and its complications, including mediastinitis and osteomyelitis, can be critical. To date, there have been no reports of non-invasive techniques to avoid sternotomy for mediastinal thyroid tumours. We investigated the safety and efficacy of thyroidectomy using the clavicle lifting technique with a paediatric Kent hook. This was a retrospective study of 8 patients who underwent thyroidectomy with a clavicle lifting technique between November 2014 and July 2021 at the Department of Surgery, International University of Health and Welfare Hospital. The primary endpoint was sternotomy avoidance rate and R0 resection rate. An extension retractor used in paediatric surgery was used for the clavicle lifting technique. Sternotomy avoidance rate and R0 resection rate were 100%. The mean operative time was 161\u00b153.5 min, and the mean blood loss was 125.6\u00b1125.8 ml. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications related to the clavicle lifting technique. Thyroidectomy with a clavicle lifting technique for mediastinal goitre and thyroid cancer is safe and useful because it avoids sternotomy without causing massive intraoperative bleeding or damage to other organs.",

Endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has recently been described in endometriosis and was induced by estrogen. Metformin has been shown to inhibit EMT in various diseases, but its role in endometriosis remains unclear. We collected endometrial tissue samples from patients with endometriosis and healthy controls and isolated primary ESCs. We performed gene expression analysis using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset and validated the results by immunohistochemistry in tissue samples. We also assessed the effects of metformin on the proliferation, migration and invasion of ectopic ESCs (EESCs) by Cell Counting Kit-8 and Transwell migration and invasion assays, respectively. We analyzed the protein expression of EMT-related markers (N-cadherin, vimentin, twist, and snail) and \u03b2-catenin by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. We found that vimentin was highly expressed in ectopic endometrial tissues compared to normal endometrial tissues. Metformin treatment inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of EESCs in a dose-dependent manner. Metformin treatment also downregulated the expression of EMT-related markers and reduced the expression and nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin in EESCs. Our results suggest that metformin inhibits estrogen-induced EMT and regulates the expression of \u03b2-catenin in EESCs.

The non-functioning PNETs are the largest group, and their morbidity is the result of their potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize. The functioning PNETs produce hormonal symptoms due to over-secretion of specific hormones. They constitute 1% to 2% of all pancreatic tumors. The use of novel imaging methods has rendered their detection more frequent. Insulinoma, the most common functioning PNET, comprises 35-40% of all functioning PNETs. Its clinical presentation is due to hyperinsulinemia and the subsequent hypoglycemia. Glucagonoma accounts for 5% of all PNETs and is the fourth most frequent functioning PNET, following insulinoma, gastrinoma, and vipoma. Its symptoms are due to the massive secretion of glucagon and ensuing hyperglycemia. The co-existence of two PNETs is a very rare entity.

The following concurrent chemotherapy regimens were administered: 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin in 58 and capecitabine in 24; in 12 cases agents were unknown. The median interval between CCRT and surgery was 8 weeks. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered after surgery in 80 patients (5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin, n=54; capecitabine, n=9; other, n=14; and unknown, n=3). Propensity-score matching analysis was conducted. The median follow-up duration was 4.3 years. There were no statistically significant differences between the short- and long-course RT groups in sphincter preservation (85.2% vs. 92.5%, p=0.478), pathological complete remission (18.5% vs. 14.9%, p=0.905), downstaging (44.4% vs. 26.9%, p=0.159), and negative circumferential resection margin (92.6% vs. 89.6%, p=0.947) rates. No differences were found in survival outcomes between the short- and long-course groups at 3 years (overall survival: 91.8% vs. 88.1%, p=0.790; disease-free survival, 75.2% vs. 72.5%, p=0.420; locoregional relapse-free survival, 90.5% vs. 98.4%, p=0.180; and distant metastasis-free survival, 79.6% vs. 73.5%, p=0.490). Similar results were observed after PSM. Clinically, short-course CCRT may be a feasible alternative to long-course CCRT in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.",

Animal models for cancer in FA mice used orthotopic tumors from wild type mice. We derived a cancer cell line from Fanca-/- mice by topical application of the chemical carcinogen dimethyl benzanthracene (DMBA). A Fanca-/- mouse rhabdomyosarcoma was derived from a Fanca-/- (129/Sv) mouse. The in vitro clonogenic survival of the Fanca-/- clone 6 cancer cell line was consistent with the FA genotype. Transplanted tumors demonstrated hypoxic centers surrounded by senescent cells.

Three-hundred-and-thirty breast cancer patients completed Distress Thermometers before and directly after RT. Distress was evaluated in the entire cohort and different groups of age, sex, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), intent of RT, and previous RT. Mean change of distress scores was - 0.4 points, which was significantly associated with KPS. Decrease of distress was more pronounced in patients with KPS \u226480 or age <64 years. Deterioration (yes vs. no) was non-significantly associated with no previous RT. In patients with pre-RT distress scores \u22645 points, mean score increased by +0.5 points; no significant associations between characteristics and investigated endpoints were found. Psychological assistance should be offered to all patients irradiated for breast cancer, particularly to those with risk factors, regardless of the pre-RT distress score.",

Computed tomography (CT) scans without and with intravenous contrast (ic) were performed and co-registered. Left breast and organs at risk (OARs) were contoured. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for 3D-CRT and HT treatment plans were evaluated in terms of planning target volume for evaluation (PTVeval) coverage and dose to the OARs. HT provided the best target coverage and significantly reduced D2% and mean dose to the left anterior descending artery (LADA) and to the LADA-planning organ at risk volume (PRV), D2%, V5 and mean dose to the LV and D2% and V25 to the heart. As expected, due to the rotational delivery, the dose to all other coronary arteries and their PRV, contralateral breast and lungs was higher with HT. In left-sided BC, HT provided the best target coverage and significantly reduced LV and LADA doses. Moreover D2% and V25 to the heart were significantly reduced.

        "AbstractText": "Preoperative osteopenia, defined as low bone mineral density, is a prognostic factor in patients with digestive tract cancers, including gastric cancer (GC). However, the correlation between preoperative osteopenia and GC in elderly patients is unclear. We enrolled 251 patients who had undergone curative surgery for histopathologically diagnosed gastric adenocarcinoma from January 2008 to December 2012. Patients were classified into the non-elderly group (n=169) and the elderly group (n=82). Bone mineral density was calculated as the average pixel density (Hounsfield units) within a circle of the mid-vertebral core at the bottom of the 11th thoracic vertebra on preoperative computed tomography. Although overall survival was significantly shorter in the elderly compared to the non-elderly group (p=0.0062), there was no significant difference in disease-specific survival between the two groups (p=0.71) because of the higher rate of death from other diseases. In addition, the elderly group had a significantly higher incidence of osteopenia (p<0.001) and a significantly lower prognostic nutritional index (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative osteopenia and a low preoperative prognostic nutritional index were significant risk factors for death from other diseases after gastrectomy in elderly patients. In elderly patients with GC, preoperative osteopenia is an important factor to consider in terms of both curability and death from other diseases.",

Molecular subtyping has provided valuable insights for treatment decisions, but challenges remain in adjuvant treatment for hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative luminal BC (LBC). Multigene markers like Oncotype DX have emerged to provide more precise prognostic information. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of gene expression panels on fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), quality of life (QoL), and healthcare-related greenhouse emissions. A monocentric retrospective analysis was conducted using a prospective database of patients undergoing Oncotype DX. QoL assessments were performed using the Short Breast Health Perception Questionnaire (BHPQ) and Life Satisfaction Questionnaire (LSQ-32). Reductions in hospital visits and travel distance were analyzed. Twenty-eight patients underwent Oncotype DX testing. Of these, 17.85% received adjuvant chemotherapy based on the recurrence score (RS). The implementation of Oncotype DX resulted in a significant reduction in hospital visits, travel distance, and healthcare-related greenhouse gas emissions. QoL assessments using BHPQ and LSQ-32 showed lower levels of FCR and improved QoL in various domains for patients who received hormone therapy (HT) alone. The implementation of Oncotype DX in clinical practice has the potential to reduce overtreatment, decrease healthcare-related greenhouse gas emissions, and improve QoL. Lower levels of FCR and improved QoL were observed in patients who received HT-only based on the RS score.",

        "AbstractText": "Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) is a rare, slow growing intra-epidermal malignant neoplasm that arises in areas rich in apocrine glands. Several common sites of occurrence have been reported, including the vulva, perianal region, perineum, and scrotum. Most relevant studies rely on small data bases. Our objective was to evaluate prognostic factors of EMPD patients at a single medical center. We retrospectively analyzed 19 patients (8 males, 11 females) diagnosed with genital EMPD who were treated at the Taichung Veterans General Hospital between 2006/04 and 2022/08. Collected information included tumor location, margin condition in the case of surgical resection, recurrence rate, recurrence management, accompanied gastrointestinal malignancy, treatment details and survival data. Among 19 cases, 4 with initial margin being positive, and 3 received second surgery (one refused surgery and another expired within a year). Tumor recurrence was found in 7 cases, with 6 of them later receiving second surgery, and the remaining one received radiation therapy. Median DFS was 7.57 years. During the 15-year follow-up, 2 patients expired. Overall survival rate was 87.5%. Among all factors we had analyzed, only those accompanied with GI tract malignancy had significantly worse survival rate (p=0.018). Frozen sections taken at surgical margin during surgery significantly reduced cancer recurrence rate (p=0.45). Permanent pathology margins appeared to affect the recurrence rate, but that was not significant when comparing with intraoperative frozen sections. Local wide excision with skin flap reconstruction remains the major treatment option for genital EMPD. Following the standard-of-care procedure, the overall patient outcome was excellent. Among factors potentially associated with recurrence rate, intraoperative frozen biopsy was the most significant one. Performing intraoperative frozen biopsy is essential for recurrence-free rate elevation.",

Radiological examination of a 41 years old woman showed an osteolytic lesion in the os pubis with a large soft tissue component. Examination of a core needle biopsy led to the diagnosis chondromyxoid fibroma, and the patient was treated with curettage. Microscopic examination of the specimen showed a tumor tissue in which a pink-bluish background matrix was studded with small spindled to stellate cells without atypia, fitting well the chondromyxoid fibroma diagnosis. Focally, a more cartilage-like appearance was observed with cells lying in lacunae and areas with calcification. G-banding analysis of short-term cultured tumor cells yielded the karyotype 46,XX,der(1)inv(1)(p33~34q42) add(1)(p32)?ins(1;?)(q42;?),del(5)(q31),der(5)t(1;5)(q42;q35)[12]/46,XX[3].

SL was performed in all patients with PC without radiological distant metastasis before pancreatectomy or chemotherapy at the Yamaguchi University Hospital. Between July 2020 and March 2023, 55 patients underwent SL with peritoneal cytology. The median age was 71, with 53% male patients. SL revealed occult metastasis in six (11%) patients including positive peritoneal cytology (n=6), and peritoneal dissemination (n=1). The resectability of unresectable locally advanced (UR-LA) was associated with a significantly increased risk of occult metastasis (p=0.0211).

Murine breast cancer 4T1 cells were cultured and treated with ovine IFN-\u03c4 and through MTT and Caspase-Glo 3/7 assays, viability and cell death were determined. In addition, the antitumor effect of IFN-\u03c4 was determined in a murine tumor model of TNBC. Ovine IFN-\u03c4 showed a concentration-dependent antiproliferative effect on 4T1 murine breast cancer cells. Also, treatment of 4T1 cells with IFN-\u03c4 induced the activation of caspase 3 and 7, which is indicative of apoptotic cell death. Moreover, we detected an increase in the expression of type I interferon receptor (IFNAR1/2) in cells treated with IFN-. The intratumoral application of IFN-\u03c4 in mice inhibited tumor growth compared to the control non-treated group, and the effect was associated with the increased expression of GM-CSF.

The success of PD-1 blockade therapy has been attributed to high tumor mutation burden and high immunogenicity of lung cancer cells. To further improve the efficacy of NSCLC immunotherapy and overcome the resistance of lung cancer cells to immune checkpoint blockade, new approaches that enhance the active immune response, such as neoantigen vaccines and cellular-based therapies, are urgently required. Neoantigens are considered ideal targets for cancer immunotherapy because of their high immunogenicity and specificity. In this mini review, we first discuss the current advances in neoantigen vaccines for treating cancers and then review the results of preclinical studies and early-phase human clinical trials of neoantigen-based therapies for NSCLC. Finally, we focus on the identification of neoantigens in patients with NSCLC and review the candidate mutations reported by recent studies and our investigations. The review concludes that, in addition to immune checkpoint blockade, approaches targeting neoantigens are promising for improving the efficacy of NSCLC immunotherapy.",

However, some patients experience LLNM without first developing CLNM. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for developing LLNM without CLNM. We retrospectively reviewed 421 patients diagnosed with PTC who underwent lobectomy or total thyroidectomy with central and ipsilateral lateral lymph node dissection. We collected clinicopathological data and used univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to determine the risk factors associated with LLNM without CLNM. The LLNM without CLNM frequency was 18.3% (77/421). Univariate analyses demonstrated that age over 55\u2009years, primary tumor in the upper portion of the thyroid, the number of central lymph node (CLN) and LLNM, primary tumor size, and the summed size of multi-foci tumors smaller than 1\u2009cm were significantly associated with LLNM without CLNM (p\u2009<\u20090.05).

The effect is detected at the MRI-CEST (Magnetic Resonance Imaging - Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer) signal of intracellular proton exchanging molecules. The magnitude of the change in the CEST response reports on water cycling across the membrane. The method has been tested on RBC and on orthotopic murine models of breast cancer with different degree of malignancy (4T1, TS/A and 168FARN).

In recent studies Haflinger horses with a homozygous genotype for a missense variant in the DDB2\u2009gene (damage specific DNA binding protein 2) had a significant increased risk of developing ocular SCC. The aims of this study were to determine the frequency of the SCC-associated risk allele in the DDB2\u2009gene in Swiss and Austrian Haflinger populations and to validate the previously described phenotypic correlation. For this purpose, Haflingers presented at various horse clinics in Switzerland (n = 21, including 11 SCC cases), privately kept Haflingers (n = 52, including 1 SCC case), and Haflingers from a stud farm in the Austrian Tyrol (n = 53) were recruited. The individual DDB2\u2009genotype of the animals was determined using a polymerase chain ceaction (PCR) test using hair follicle or whole blood samples. Of the 12 horses suffering from SCC, nine had ocular SCC and three had non-ocular SCC. Six of the nine Haflingers with ocular SCC and one of the three Haflingers with non-ocular SCC were homozygous for the DDB2 variant. Of the 113\u2009clinically normal animals, 7/113 were homozygous (6\u2009%) and 42/113 were heterozygous (37\u2009%), which corresponds to an allele frequency of 24,8\u2009% in the control cohort. The risk of ocular SCC occurring in Haflingers is significantly increased with the homozygous DDB2\u2009genotype. However, not all animals with SCC carry this gene variant and not all DDB2 homozygous animals develop SCC, which can be explained by the multifactorial genesis of the disease. Due to the high frequency of the undesirable allele, we recommend taking the individual DDB2\u2009genotype of breeding animals into account in order to avoid homozygous offspring with a greatly increased SCC risk by excluding high-risk matings.

Die Ziele dieser Studie bestanden darin, die H\u00e4ufigkeit des SCC-assoziierten Risikoallels im DDB2-Gen in schweizerischen und \u00f6sterreichischen Haflingerpopulationen zu bestimmen, sowie die zuvor beschriebene Ph\u00e4notypkorrelation zu validieren. Dazu wurden an verschiedenen Pferdekliniken der Schweiz vorgestellte Haflinger (n = 21, darunter 11 SCC-F\u00e4lle), privat gehaltene Haflinger (n = 52, darunter 1 SCC-Fall), sowie Haflinger eines Gest\u00fcts im \u00f6sterreichischen Tirol (n = 53) rekrutiert. Der individuelle DDB2-Genotyp der Tiere wurde per PCR-Test anhand von Haarwurzel- oder Vollblutproben bestimmt. Unter den insgesamt 12 SCC-erkrankten Pferden fanden sich neun mit okul\u00e4ren und drei mit nicht-okul\u00e4ren SCC. Sechs der neun Haflinger mit okul\u00e4rem SCC und einer der drei Haflinger mit nicht-okul\u00e4rem SCC waren homozygot f\u00fcr die DDB2-Variante. Von den 113 klinisch unauff\u00e4lligen Tieren waren 7/113 homozygot (6\u2009%) und 42/113 heterozygot (37\u2009%), was einer Allelfrequenz von 24,8\u2009% in der Kontrollkohorte entspricht. Das Risiko f\u00fcr das Auftreten des okul\u00e4ren SCC beim Haflinger ist mit dem homozygoten DDB2-Genotyp deutlich erh\u00f6ht. Allerdings tragen nicht alle SCC-erkrankten Tiere diese Genvariante und nicht alle DDB2-homozygoten Tiere entwickeln ein SCC, was sich mit der multifaktoriellen Genese der Erkrankung erkl\u00e4ren l\u00e4sst. Aufgrund der hohen Frequenz des unerw\u00fcnschten Allels empfehlen wir, den individuellen DDB2-Genotyp von Zuchttieren zu beachten, um so reinerbige Nachzucht mit stark erh\u00f6htem SCC-Risiko durch den Ausschluss von Risikoanpaarungen zu vermeiden.

Sur les 113 animaux cliniquement normaux, 7/113 \u00e9taient homozygotes (6\u2009%) et 42/113 \u00e9taient h\u00e9t\u00e9rozygotes (37\u2009%), ce qui correspond \u00e0 une fr\u00e9quence d\u2019all\u00e8le de 24,8\u2009% dans la cohorte de contr\u00f4le. Le risque de CE oculaire chez les Haflingers augmente de mani\u00e8re significative avec le g\u00e9notype DDB2 homozygote. Cependant, tous les animaux atteints de CE ne sont pas porteurs de cette variante g\u00e9n\u00e9tique et tous les animaux homozygotes DDB2 ne d\u00e9veloppent pas de CE, ce qui peut s\u2019expliquer par la gen\u00e8se multifactorielle de la maladie. En raison de la fr\u00e9quence \u00e9lev\u00e9e de l\u2019all\u00e8le ind\u00e9sirable, nous recommandons de tenir compte du g\u00e9notype DDB2 individuel des animaux reproducteurs afin d\u2019\u00e9viter une prog\u00e9niture homozygote pr\u00e9sentant un risque fortement accru de CE en excluant les accouplements \u00e0 haut risque. Gli SCC (carcinomi a cellule squamose) sono tra le neoplasie oculari pi\u00f9 comuni nei cavalli. Recenti studi hanno dimostrato che i cavalli Haflinger con un genotipo omozigote per una variante missenso nel gene DDB2 (damage specific DNA binding protein 2) presentano un significativo aumento del rischio di sviluppare SCC oculari. Gli obiettivi di questo studio erano di determinare la frequenza dell\u2019allele di rischio associato agli SCC nel gene DDB2 nelle popolazioni di cavalli Haflinger svizzere e austriache e convalidare la correlazione fenotipica precedentemente descritta. A tale scopo, sono stati inclusi nello studio cavalli Haflinger presentati in varie cliniche veterinarie in Svizzera (n = 21, di cui 11 casi di SCC), cavalli Haflinger tenuti privatamente (n = 52, di cui 1 caso di SCC) e cavalli Haflinger provenienti da un allevamento in Tirolo, Austria (n = 53). Il genotipo individuale del gene DDB2 degli animali \u00e8 stato determinato mediante un test PCR utilizzando campioni di radici dei peli o sangue intero. Dei 12 cavalli affetti da SCC, nove avevano SCC oculari e tre avevano SCC non oculari. Sei dei nove Haflinger con SCC oculari e uno dei tre Haflinger con SCC non oculari erano omozigoti per la variante DDB2. Dei 113 animali clinicamente normali, 7/113 erano omozigoti (6\u2009%) e 42/113 erano eterozigoti (37\u2009%), corrispondenti a una frequenza dell\u2019allele del 24,8\u2009% nella coorte di controllo. Il rischio di sviluppare SCC oculari nei cavalli Haflinger \u00e8 significativamente aumentato con il genotipo omozigote per il gene DDB2. Tuttavia, non tutti gli animali affetti da SCC portano questa variante genetica e non tutti gli animali DDB2 omozigoti sviluppano un SCC, il che pu\u00f2 essere spiegato dalla natura multifattoriale della malattia. A causa dell\u2019alta frequenza dell\u2019allele indesiderato, raccomandiamo di tenere conto del genotipo individuale del gene DDB2 negli animali da riproduzione al fine di evitare una discendenza omozigote con un elevato rischio di SCC, quindi escludendo gli accoppiamenti ad alto rischio.",

        "AbstractText": "The Hippo signaling axis is a tumor suppressor pathway that is activated by various extra-pathway factors to regulate cell differentiation and organ development. Recent studies have reported that autophosphorylation of the core kinase cassette stimulates activation of the Hippo signaling cascade. Here, we demonstrate that protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) contributes to inactivation of the Hippo signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer. We show that the Hippo pathway initiator serine/threonine kinase 3 (STK3, also known as MST2) of Hippo signaling pathway can be symmetrically di-methylated by PRMT5 at arginine-461 (R461) and arginine-467 (R467) in its SARAH domain. Methylation suppresses MST2 autophosphorylation and kinase activity by blocking its homodimerization, thereby inactivating Hippo signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer. Moreover, we also show that the specific PRMT5 inhibitor GSK3326595 re-activates the dysregulated Hippo signaling pathway and inhibits the growth of human pancreatic cancer xenografts in immunodeficient mice, thus suggesting potential clinical application of PRMT5 inhibitors in pancreatic cancer.",

The review provides an overview of the diagnosis of WM, with a particular focus on the role of immunophenotyping and genotyping. Demonstration of LPL with a bone marrow biopsy is essential to reach a definitive diagnosis of WM. However, MYD88L265P and a typical WM immunophenotypic profile are valuable for the differential diagnosis of WM and related diseases, such as marginal zone lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. These methodologies must be utilized across centers and with appropriate standards followed in the evaluation and reporting of sensitivities and specificities. The diagnostic and/or prognostic value of mutations in genes such as CXCR4 and TP53 that are currently not routinely evaluated in the diagnosis of WM should be explored.",

Materials & methods: A questionnaire survey on decision-making support was conducted. The level of clinician support was classified as 'supporting patients' 'decision-making process regarding cancer treatment', 'no support for patients' 'decision-making process regarding cancer treatment' or 'team-based support for patients' 'decision-making process regarding cancer treatment'. Results: Physicians estimated that 83.7% of patients made a cancer treatment decision within 1 week, but 45.4% of patients had difficulty making a decision. Conclusion: Medical personnel should support patients who have difficulty making decisions, establish a screening method to identify those needing support and develop a system providing decision-making support through interprofessional work. We conducted a survey to investigate issues related to the level of decision-making support provided by physicians, nurses, pharmacists medical social workers and psychiatric social workers involved in cancer care. The physicians reported that 83.7% of patients with cancer chose a treatment plan within 1 week, although 45.4% of patients had difficulty making a decision. These decision-making difficulties arose at the time of diagnosis, when having difficulty controlling adverse events and when cancer metastasis or recurrence occurred. Some medical providers supported patients who had particular difficulty in choosing their cancer treatment, others provided no support, while a third group orchestrated a team to support them in their decision-making. To improve the quality of decision-making support, interprofessional work should be promoted and screening tools to identify those who need support should be established.",

        "AbstractText": "Doctors (and sociologists) have a long history of struggling to understand why patients seek medical help yet resist treatment recommendations. Explanations for resistance have pointed to macrostructural changes, such as the rise of the engaged patient or decline of physician authority. Rather than assuming that concepts such as resistance, authority, or engagement are exogenous phenomena transmitted via conversational conduits, we examine how they are dynamically co-constituted interactionally. Using conversation analysis to analyze a videotaped interaction of an oncology patient resisting the treatment recommendation even though she might die without treatment, we show how sustained resistance manifests in and through her doctor's actions. This paradox, in which the doctor can both recommend life-prolonging care and condition resistance to it, has broad relevance beyond cancer treatment; it also can help us to understand other doctor-patient decisional conflicts, for instance, medication nonadherence, delaying emergent care, and vaccine refusal.",

        "AbstractText": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly important in liquid biopsy for cancer because they contain multiple biomarkers, including proteins and RNAs, and circulate throughout the body. Cancer cell-derived EVs are highly heterogeneous, and multiplexed biomarker detection techniques are required to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. In addition, in situ EV biomarker detection increases the efficiency of the detection process because EVs are difficult to handle. In this study, in situ simultaneous detection of EV surface proteins, programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and internal miRNA-21 (miR-21) analyzed by conventional flow cytometry was developed for a breast cancer liquid biopsy. However, the majority of EVs were not recognized by flow cytometry for biomarker detection because the size of EVs was below the detectable size range of the flow cytometer. To solve this problem, the formation of EV clusters was induced by 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE)-polyethylene glycol-DSPE during biomarker detection. Consequently, both PD-L1 and miR-21 detection signals from cancer cell-derived EVs were drastically increased, making them distinguishable from normal cell-derived EVs. The in situ simultaneous cancer biomarker detection from EV clusters analyzed by flow cytometry contributes to an increase in the sensitivity and accuracy of the EV-based liquid biopsy for cancer.",

A total of 452 postoperative patients with undifferentiated sarcoma in the trunk and extremity from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database were enrolled as the training cohort. We collected a group of 163 undifferentiated sarcoma patients from our center as the external validation cohort. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to screen survival-associated factors for the construction of the nomogram. Concordance-indexes (C-indexes), calibration curves, and receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) curves were applied for the discrimination and calibration of the nomogram. The cutoff value of nomogram-based total points was applied to stratify the risk of patients. A nomogram was developed incorporating four independent factors: age, tumor site, eighth AJCC stage, and radiotherapy. The nomogram showed good prognostic accuracy and excellent agreement in the training and validation cohort, with C-indexes of .701 (95% confidence interval [CI]: .683-.719) and .700 (95% CI: 0.659-.741), respectively. Furthermore, we identified the best cutoff value of nomogram total points (103.2) as the predicted risk and divided the patients into a high-risk group and a low-risk group. Significant differences in OS between the two groups were indicated in the training cohort and external validation cohort, showing the appreciable clinical validity and clinical utility of the nomogram (P < .001).

This randomized controlled study was conducted over 24\u2009months in four hospitals in Egypt. A sample of 90 patients was randomly assigned to either treatment group, with procedures including baseline examinations, a single postoperative instillation of chemotherapy, a 6-week induction cycle of the assigned drug, and regular follow-up cystoscopies and upper urinary tract imaging. Treatment results and side effects were monitored, with data analyzed via Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). No significant differences were observed in mean age or tumor characteristics (p\u2009>\u20090.05). However, adverse reactions were significantly higher in the BCG group, including cystitis (40% vs. 17.78%, p\u2009=\u20090.020), hematuria (24.44% vs. 4.44%, p\u2009=\u20090.007), overall local reactions (75.56% vs. 26.67%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), fever (13.33% vs. 2.22%, p\u2009=\u20090.049), and fatigue (17.78% vs. 2.22%, p\u2009=\u20090.014).

        "AbstractText": "Lung cancer is the leading global cause of cancer-related death, however, resistance to chemotherapy drugs remains a huge barrier to effective treatment. The elevated recruitment of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to tumour after chemotherapy has been linked to resistance of chemotherapy drugs. Nevertheless, the specific mechanism remains unclear. oxPAPC is a bioactive principal component of minimally modified low-density lipoproteins and regulates inflammatory response. In this work, we found that cisplatin, oxaliplatin and ADM all increased oxPAPC release in tumour. Treating macrophages with oxPAPC in vitro stimulated the secretion of MCP-1 and LTB4, which strongly induced monocytes and neutrophils chemotaxis, respectively. Injection of oxPAPC in vivo significantly upregulated the percentage of MDSCs in tumour microenvironment (TME) of wild-type LL2 tumour-bearing mice, but not CCL2-/- mice and LTB4R-/- mice. Critically, oxPAPC acted as a pro-tumor factor in LL2 tumour model. Indeed, cisplatin increased oxPAPC level in tumour tissues of WT mice, CCL2-/- and LTB4R-/- mice, but caused increased infiltration of Ly6Chigh monocytes and neutrophils only in WT LL2-bearing mice. Collectively, our work demonstrates cisplatin treatment induces an overproduction of oxPAPC and thus recruits MDSCs infiltration to promote the tumour growth through the MCP-1/CCL2 and LTB4/LTB4R pathways, which may restrict the effect of multiple chemotherapy. This provides evidence for a potential strategy to enhance the efficacy of multiple chemotherapeutic drugs in the treatment of lung cancer by targeting oxPAPC.",

There have been several couple-based psychological interventions, and yet the impact of this treatment modality on the mental health of PCa patients and their spouses is unclear. Consequently, a systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, LILACS, and Web of Science up to March 2023 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) addressing the impacts of couple-based psychological interventions on both PCa patients and their spouses. Besides, the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool was employed to evaluate the methodological quality and potential bias of the included studies. Moreover, statistical analysis and meta-analysis were performed utilizing Revman 5.4, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was employed to assess the certainty of evidence. A total of nine RCTs were included, utilizing anxiety, depression, distress, communication, and self-efficacy as outcome indicators to assess mental health. Results demonstrated that couple-based psychological interventions increased spouses' self-efficacy (WMD, 0.21; 95% CI: -0.00\u2009~\u20090.42; P\u2009=\u20090.05) and communication (SMD, 0.34; 95% CI: 0.09\u2009~\u20090.59; P\u2009=\u20090.009), while reducing their distress (SMD, -0.21; 95% CI: -0.40\u2009~\u2009-0.02; P\u2009=\u20090.03).

        "AbstractText": "Lipid oxidation is a universal degradative process of cell membrane lipids that is induced by oxidative stress and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) in multiple pathophysiological situations. It has been shown that certain oxidized lipids alter membrane properties, leading to a loss of membrane function. Alteration of membrane properties is thought to depend on the initial membrane lipid composition, such as the number of acyl chain unsaturations. However, it is unclear how oxidative damage is related to biophysical properties of membranes. We therefore set out to quantify lipid oxidation through various analytical methods and determine key biophysical membrane parameters using model membranes containing lipids with different degrees of lipid unsaturation. As source for RONS we used cold plasma that is currently developed as treatment for infections and cancer. Our data revealed complex lipid oxidation that can lead to two main permeabilization mechanisms. The first one appears upon direct contact of membranes with RONS and depends on the formation of truncated oxidized phospholipids. These lipids seem to be partly released from the bilayer, implying that they are likely to interact with other membranes and potentially act as signaling molecules. This mechanism is independent of lipid unsaturation, does not rely on large variations in lipid packing and is most probably mediated via short-living RONS. The second mechanism overtakes after longer incubation periods and depends probably on the continued formation of lipid oxygen adducts such as lipid hydroperoxides or ketones. This mechanism depends on lipid unsaturation and involves large variations in lipid packing. This study indicates that polyunsaturated lipids, that are present in mammalian membranes rather than in bacteria, do not sensitize membranes to instant permeabilization by RONS but could promote long term damage.",

        "AbstractText": "To evaluate the temporal and spatial distribution of the knowledge network about tumor microenvironment and prognoses and explore new research hot spots and trends. Articles and reviews on tumor microenvironment and prognoses in the Web of Science journal from January 1999 to April 2022 were included. We used the CiteSpace and VOSviewer software to analyze the knowledge network composed of journals, institutions, countries, authors, and keywords. Frontiers in Immunology, Cancers, and Frontiers in Oncology have published more than 10% of articles in this field. China and the United States have contributed the most articles. Fudan University and Sun Yat-Sen University are the most active institutions. The authors in this field work closely; Zhang Wei and Douglas have made outstanding contributions. The three main research areas of tumor microenvironment and prognoses are microenvironment, prognosis, and immunotherapy. Until 2020, the main keywords were endothelial growth factor and adhesion. In the past three years, survival analysis, immune cell infiltration, and prediction model have been used. It can be seen that the focus in this field has shifted from tumor cell behavior and directly related molecules to prognosis prediction and non-tumor cells in the microenvironment. The future research trend may be to study the changes in the tumor microenvironment to predict the prognosis and guide the treatment. VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and Microsoft Excel 2019 were used to conduct a comprehensive visual analysis of the research on tumor environment and prognoses and provide valuable reference materials for researchers.",

        "AbstractText": "For decades, immunotherapies have offered hope for patients with advanced cancer. However, they show distinct benefits and limited clinical effects. Tumor vaccines have the potential to prime tumor-antigen-specific T cells and induce broad subsets of immune responses, ultimately eradicating tumor cells. Here, we classify tumor vaccines by their anti-tumor mechanisms, which include boosting the immune system, overcoming tumor immunosuppression, and modulating tumor angiogenesis. We focus on multidimensional tumor vaccine strategies using combinations of two or three of the above mechanisms, as these are superior to single-dimensional treatments. This review offers a perspective on tumor vaccine strategies and the future role of vaccine therapies in cancer treatment.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Effect of different catheter pathways on wounds after minimally invasive radical prostatectomy: A meta-analysis.",
        "AbstractText": "Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in men. With the rapidly increasing surgical rate of minimally invasive radical prostatectomy, there is still controversy about how to use a urinary catheter post-operatively. Thus, we attempted to compare the post-operative wound-related outcomes through a meta-analysis of urethral catheterisation (UC) versus suprapubic catheterisation (SPC) after minimally invasive radical prostatectomy. As of August 2023, the authors conducted systematic searches in databases such as PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. The authors reviewed the relevant literature separately to determine comparisons between SPC and UC treatment after radical prostatectomy. A total of 395 subjects were enrolled in the five trials, met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Data collection and analysis revealed significant differences in catheter bother to patients for surgical trauma (MD, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.48, 1.48 p\u2009=\u20090.0001), with SPC causing less catheter bother to patients post-operatively; post-operative catheter-related problems (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 0.03, 326.1 p\u2009=\u20090.61), the POD1 of the post-operative period (MD, - 0.09; 95% CI, -0.75, 0.94 p\u2009=\u20090.83) and the POD3 of the post-operative period (MD, -0.49; 95% CI, -0.99, 0.01 p\u2009=\u20090.06); there was no statistically significant difference in wound pain. Compared with UC, SPC patients had less post-operative catheter distress. Thus, SPC is more beneficial in reducing post-operative wound discomfort in patients. The validity of the results remains to be tested in more and better studies.",

        "AbstractText": "As an important and serious condition impacting human health, the diagnosis, and treatment of tumours is clinically vital because tumour cell immune escape sustains tumour development. Programed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) on tumour cell surfaces binds to the programed death-1 (PD-1), inhibits T cell activation, and induces apoptosis, and incapacitates cells. This allows tumour cells to evade recognition and clearance by the immune system, thereby permitting tumour occurrence, and development and poor prognosis outcomes in patients with tumours. Currently, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy has become pivotal in tumour treatment. Pathogens, especially viruses, are important factors which induce many tumours. In this article, we examine associations between Epstein-Barr virus, human papilloma virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1-related tumours and PD-1/PD-L1 axis.",

        "AbstractText": "Conventional magnetic nanoagents in cancer hyperthermia therapy suffer from a low magnetic heating efficiency. To address this issue, researchers have pursued magnetic nanoparticles with topological magnetic domain structures, such as the vortex-domain structure, to enhance the magnetic heating performance of conventional nanoparticles while maintaining excellent biocompatibility. In this study, we synthesized hollow spherical Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 (MZF-HS) nanoparticles using a straightforward solvothermal method, yielding samples with an average outer diameter of approximately 350 nm and an average inner diameter of about 220 nm. The heating efficiency of the nanoparticles was experimentally verified, and the specific absorption rate (SAR) value of the hollow MZF was found to be approximately 1.5 times that of solid MZF. The enhanced heating performance is attributed to the vortex states in the hollow MZF structure as validated with micromagnetic simulation studies. In vitro studies demonstrated the lower cell viability of breast cancer cells (MCF-7, BT549, and 4T1) after MHT in the presence of MZF-HS. The synthesized MZF caused 51% cell death after MHT, while samples of MZF-HS resulted in 77% cell death. Our findings reveal that magnetic particles with a vortex state demonstrate superior heating efficiency, highlighting the potential of hollow spherical particles as effective heat generators for MHT applications.",

We evaluated the effect of food on its pharmacokinetics, and examined the pharmacokinetics of an oral suspension (OS) of disintegrated tablets, in a phase I, open-label, crossover three-period study (NCT04702698). Twelve healthy volunteers were randomized to one of six treatment sequences. They received a single dose of peposertib 100\u2009mg as film-coated tablets under fasted or fed conditions (\"tablet fasted\" or \"tablet fed\") or as an OS under fasted conditions (\"OS fasted\"), with washout between treatments. Using healthy volunteers was possible because, despite its mechanism of action being suppression of DNA repair, peposertib has shown no genotoxic effect in animals. A mild food effect was observed with peposertib tablets. Fed-to-fasted ratios were: area under the curve from time 0 to time t (AUC0-t ), 123.81% (90% confidence interval [CI]: 108.04, 141.87%); AUC from zero to infinity (AUC0-\u221e ), 110.28% (90% CI 100.71, 120.77%); and maximum concentration (Cmax ) 104.47% (90% CI: 79.15, 137.90%). Cmax was delayed under fed conditions (median time to maximum concentration [Tmax ] was 3.5\u2009h [tablet fed] vs. 1\u2009h [tablet fasted]). OS-to-tablet (fasted) ratios were: AUC0-t , 124.83% (90% CI: 111.50%, 139.76%); AUC0-\u221e , 119.05% (90% CI: 104.47, 135.67%); and Cmax 173.29% (90% CI: 135.78, 221.16%). Median Tmax was 0.5\u2009h (OS fasted) versus 1\u2009h (tablet). All treatments were well-tolerated in healthy volunteers. Peposertib tablets can be taken with or without food; if combined with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, the delay in Cmax must be considered to optimize the chemo- or radiosensitizing effect. The peposertib OS form represents an alternative route of administration in patients with specific cancers causing dysphagia. However, the OS form should be part of future dose optimization strategies in relevant settings.",

        "AbstractText": "The incidence and related death of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have increased over the past decades. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HCC pathogenesis are not fully understood. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) RP11-495P10.1 has been proven to be closely associated with the progression of prostate cancer, but its role and specific mechanism in HCC are still unknown. Here, we identify that RP11-495P10.1 is highly expressed in HCC tissues and cells and contributes to the proliferation of HCC cells. Moreover, this study demonstrates that RP11-495P10.1 affects the proliferation of HCC by negatively regulating the expression of nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group a member 3 (NR4A3). Glycometabolism reprogramming is one of the main characteristics of tumor cells. In this study, we discover that RP11-495P10.1 regulates glycometabolism reprogramming by changing the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), thus contributing to the proliferation of HCC cells. Furthermore, knockdown of RP11-495P10.1 increases enrichment of H3K27Ac in the promoter of NR4A3 by promoting the activity of PDH and the production of acetyl-CoA, which leads to the increased transcription of NR4A3. Altogether, RP11-495P10.1 promotes HCC cell proliferation by regulating the reprogramming of glucose metabolism and acetylation of the NR4A3 promoter via the PDK1/PDH axis, which provides an lncRNA-oriented therapeutic strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC.",

In this study, we apply 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues in patients with CRC to determine the microbial differences. A discovery cohort, including 30 patients with NI, 23 with VT, and 35 with double-negative CRC tissue, is utilized. Then, we analyze the relationship between the specific bacterial taxa and indicators of different dimensions in separate cohorts. In the discovery cohort, the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome distinctly differ between the tumor and nontumor tissues in the NI and VT groups. A high abundance of Cupriavidus is found to be related to a short survival time of NI CRC, while Herbaspirillum is a potential microbial biomarker predicting the prognosis of patients with CRC with NI or VT. Moreover, the abundance of Cupriavidus or Herbaspirillum is associated with some clinical patient characteristics and prognosis, respectively. In conclusion, this study is the first to comprehensively elaborate the differences in the gut microbiota of patients with CRC with different invasion statuses and to prove the relationship between some gut microbiota and clinical patient characteristics.",

        "AbstractText": "Cancer is considered a leading cause of mortality. This rising cancer death rate and several existing limitations like side effects, poor efficacies, and high cost of the present chemotherapeutic agents have increased the demand for more potent and alternative cancer treatments. This review elucidated a brief overview of Biochanin A (BCA) and its potentiality on various cancers with details of anticancer mechanism. According to our review, a number of studies including in silico, in vitro, pre-clinical, and clinical trials have tested to evaluate the efficacy of BCA. This compound is effective against 15 types of cancer, including breast, cervical, colorectal, gastric, glioblastoma, liver, lung, melanoma, oral, osteosarcoma, ovarian, pancreatic, pharynx, prostate, and umbilical vein cancer. The general anticancer activities of this compound are mediated via several molecular processes, including regulation of apoptosis, cell proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis, signaling, enzymatic pathways, and other mechanisms. Targeting both therapeutic and oncogenic proteins, as well as different pathways, makes up the molecular mechanism underlying the anticancer action. Many signaling networks and their components, such as EFGR, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, MAPK, MMP-2, MMP-9, PARP, Caspase-3/8/9, Bax, Bcl2, PDL-1, NF-\u03baB, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, JAK, STAT3, VEGFR, VEGF, c-MY, Cyclin B1, D1, E1 and CDKs, Snail, and E-cadherin proteins, can be regulated in cancer cells by BCA. Such kind of anticancer properties of BCA could be a result of its correct structural chemistry. The use of BCA-based therapies as nano-carriers for the delivery of chemotherapeutic medicines has the potential to be very effective. This natural compound synergises with other natural compounds and standard drugs, including sorafenib, 5-fluorouracil, temozolomide, doxorubicin, apigenin, and genistein. Moreover, proper use of this compound can reverse multidrug resistance through numerous mechanisms. BCA has better drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic properties and is nontoxic (eye, liver, kidney, skin, cardio) in human bodies. As having a wide range of cancer-fighting mechanisms, synergistic effects, and good pharmacokinetic properties, BCA can be used as a supplementary food until standard drugs are available at pharma markets.",

Despite extensive research into the relationship between alcohol consumption and cancer risk, the effect of light alcohol consumption on cancer risk remains a topic of debate. To contribute to this discourse, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis. Our systematic review aimed to investigate the associations between different levels of alcohol consumption and the risk of several cancer types. We focused on analyzing prospective associations using data from 139 cohort studies. Among them, 106 studies were included in the meta-analysis after a quantitative synthesis. Our analysis did not find a significant association between light alcohol consumption and all-cause cancer risk (relative risk [RR]=1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99-1.04), but we observed a dose-response relationship. Light alcohol consumption was significantly associated with higher risks of esophageal, colorectal, and breast cancers. Light to moderate drinking was associated with elevated risks of esophageal, colorectal, laryngeal, and breast cancers. Heavy drinking was also found to contribute to the risk of stomach, liver, pancreas, and prostate cancers, thereby increasing the risk of almost all types of cancer. Additionally, women generally had lower cancer risks compared to men. Our findings highlight that cancer risks extend beyond heavy alcohol consumption to include light alcohol consumption as well. These findings suggest that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption associated with cancer risk.

Information on participation in national screening programs, including breast cancer screening, general health, and gastric, colorectal, and cervical cancers, up to 2020 was collected. Screening participation rates within the first 2- and 5-year post-diagnosis were calculated by diagnosis year and fitted with joinpoint regression models to assess temporal trends. Overall, the participation rate in breast cancer screening within 2 years post-diagnosis increased from 10.9% to 14.0% from 2009-2016, with an annual percentage change (APC) of 3.7% (p<0.05).

Nevertheless, there remains limited clarity regarding our understanding of the tumor microenvironment and metabolic characteristics associated with it. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are the predominant transmembrane transporters found in organisms. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the role of ABC transporters in breast cancer. Transcriptome data from breast cancer patients were downloaded from the TCGA database. ABC transporter-related genes were obtained from the Genecards database. By LASSO regression, ABC-associated prognostic signature was constructed in breast cancer. Subsequently, immune microenvironment analysis was performed. Finally, cell experiments were performed to verify the function of ABCB7 in the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. Using the ABC transporter-associated signature, we calculated a risk score for each breast cancer patient. Patients with breast cancer were subsequently categorized into high-risk and low-risk groups, utilizing the median risk score as the threshold. Notably, patients in the high-risk group exhibited significantly worse prognosis (P<0.05). Additionally, differences were observed in terms of immune cell infiltration levels, immune correlations, and gene expression of immune checkpoints between the two groups. Functional experiments conducted on breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 demonstrated that ABCB7 knockdown significantly diminished cell activity, proliferation, invasion, and migration. These findings emphasize the significance of understanding ABC transporter-mediated metabolic and transport characteristics in breast cancer, offering promising directions for further research and potential therapeutic interventions.",

Although it most commonly involves the mucosal epithelial lining of the upper respiratory tract, on rare occasions, it can also involve lung parenchyma. RRP carries the risk of malignant transformation, most often to non-small-cell squamous lung cancer. Here, we present the case of a 32-year-old pregnant female with a past medical history of RRP who developed mild respiratory distress during her immediate postpartum period. This prompted imaging of the chest which revealed right lower lobe hypodensities with extensive hilar and perihilar lymphadenopathy. Histopathology of the bronchial specimen showed squamous cell carcinoma with 100% programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Gross examination of the patient's placenta showed multiple tan-colored nodules which was confirmed on histopathological examination as multifocal regions of squamous cell carcinoma metastatic from the lung. The patient underwent a staging positron emission tomography (PET) scan which showed hypermetabolic regions in the right middle and lower lobes of the lung, with avidity in the right paratracheal region and an enhancing lesion in the left breast. Biopsy from the breast lesion was also positive for squamous cell carcinoma and PD-L1. She was diagnosed with Stage IVB (T1c, N3, M1c) non-small-cell squamous lung cancer and was started on pembrolizumab. Carboplatin and paclitaxel were added after an initial mixed response to therapy. The patient was non-compliant with her updated treatment regimen as well as with outpatient follow-up visits. A restaging PET scan demonstrated an inadequate response to the amended immunotherapy/chemotherapy regimen. Ultimately, she passed away within one and a half years of her initial diagnosis. Malignant transformation of papillomatous lesions into squamous cell cancer is infrequent, and the occurrence of metastasis to the breast and/or placenta is exceptionally rare. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of placental and breast metastasis of squamous cell lung cancer in a patient with RRP.",

        "AbstractText": "Obesity is a global health concern, necessitating effective weight-loss interventions. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of semaglutide, a pharmacotherapeutic option, with bariatric surgery, a commonly utilized surgical intervention, for weight reduction. A systematic review of clinical trials, including the STEP (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People) trials, sustain trials, pioneer trials, and the STAMPEDE (Surgical Treatment and Medications Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently) trial, was conducted to evaluate the outcomes of these interventions. The analysis of the clinical trials revealed that semaglutide demonstrated significant weight reduction in participants. However, adverse effects such as gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, increased pulse rate, and rare cases of thyroid cancer were observed. Long-term effects showed partial weight regain and a return of certain cardiometabolic variables to baseline levels after semaglutide withdrawal. Comparatively, bariatric surgery, as demonstrated in the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) consortium and supported by the STAMPEDE trial, exhibited higher efficacy in weight reduction and the management of obesity-induced complications such as diabetes. The STAMPEDE trial demonstrated that bariatric surgery, specifically Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), led to a significantly higher percentage of patients achieving desired diabetes treatment targets compared to medical therapy alone. While bariatric surgery showed superior efficacy, it also carried a higher risk of complications. In contrast, semaglutide presented a noninvasive alternative with significant weight reduction and lower incidences of adverse effects. In conclusion, this study highlights that bariatric surgery, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, remains a highly effective intervention for weight loss and management of obesity-induced complications. However, semaglutide represents a valuable noninvasive alternative, offering significant weight reduction and lower risks of adverse effects. The choice between these interventions should be based on individual patient characteristics and a comprehensive assessment of the risk-benefit profile.",

Methodology The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed on 75 frozen tissue and FNA samples each from 19 cases of follicular thyroid hyperplasia\u00a0(FTH), 10 nodular goiters (NGs), 17 follicular thyroid adenomas (FTAs), eight follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs), 12 follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinomas (FVPTCs), and nine classic papillary thyroid carcinomas (CPTCs) that were diagnosed according to the 2017 WHO classification of thyroid neoplasms. The GDF-15 mRNA expression in all these cases was assessed and compared with the control thyroid tissue samples. One-way analysis of variance and the Kruskal-Wallis test were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 software to determine the significance of differences in the GDF-15 mRNA levels among various thyroid lesions. Results A higher GDF-15 mRNA expression was noted in the malignant thyroid neoplasms including FTC, FVPTC, and CPTC in comparison to FTA, with a fold change between the malignant and benign groups being more than 244.18 times. A difference in the fold change was noted between FTH and FTA with an increase in GDF-15 mRNA level in the latter, which was statistically not significant. Conclusions The fact that GDF-15 mRNA was studied both on fine-needle aspiration cytologic and the frozen tissue material and that the majority of the lesions studied were follicular-patterned establishes the GDF-15 as a potential marker not only for diagnosing malignant thyroid neoplasms of the follicular epithelium but also in distinguishing benign and malignant follicular-patterned neoplasms of the thyroid.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Evaluation of Bone and Soft Tissue Tumors of the Shoulder Girdle.",
        "AbstractText": "The shoulder girdle comprises the scapula, clavicle, proximal humerus, and the soft tissues surrounding these structures. Bone and soft tissue tumors are notably more prevalent in the lower extremity than in the upper extremity. However, the shoulder ranks as the third most common site for primary tumors, following the hip-pelvis and knee. This study conducted a retrospective examination of patients who presented with pain and swelling in the shoulder and its vicinity. The evaluation was carried out using a multidisciplinary approach by the Bone and Soft Tissue Tumors Council. The study included 224 patients diagnosed with a tumoral lesion in the shoulder girdle between 2004 and 2021. Among these patients, 22 were assessed to have lesions other than tumors, while 105 (51.98%) had benign lesions, and 97 had malignant lesions. The most prevalent benign lesions were cystic bone lesions (30) and soft tissue lipomas (10). The primary form of malignant lesion was metastatic tumors (49). Pathologies in the shoulder girdle may manifest through pain, palpable swelling, pathological fractures, or may be incidentally detected via radiological imaging. Notably, pain, hypercalcemia, and pathological fractures are significant indicators, especially in cases of bone metastases, which often follow a highly fatal course when involving long bones. The musculoskeletal system is the third most common site for metastasis, following the lungs and liver. Hence, particular attention should be directed toward metastatic concerns in the shoulder and its surrounding area.",

        "AbstractText": "Chronic illnesses are a major threat to global population health through the lifespan into older age. Despite world-wide public health goals, there has been a steady increase in chronic and non-communicable diseases (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders) and strong growth in mental health disorders. In 2010, 67% of deaths worldwide were due to chronic diseases and this increased to 74% in 2019, with accelerated growth in the COVID-19 era and its aftermath. Aging and wellbeing across the lifespan are positively impacted by the presence of effective prevention and management of chronic illness that can enhance population health. This paper provides a short overview of the journey to this current situation followed by discussion of how we may better address what the World Health Organization has termed the \"tsunami of chronic diseases.\" In this paper we advocate for the development, validation, and subsequent deployment of integrated: 1. Polygenic and multifactorial risk prediction tools to screen for those at future risk of chronic disease and those with undiagnosed chronic disease. 2. Advanced preventive, behavior change and chronic disease management to maximize population health and wellbeing. 3. Digital health systems to support greater efficiencies in population-scale health prevention and intervention programs. It is argued that each of these actions individually has an emerging evidence base. However, there has been limited research to date concerning the combined population-level health effects of their integration. We outline the conceptual framework within which we are planning and currently conducting studies to investigate the effects of their integration.",

The study was conducted by a descriptive and longitudinal follow-up method on 102 thyroid carcinoma patients at 103 Military Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam. All patients were identified with the BRAF V600E gene mutation by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The rate of BRAF V600E gene mutation in patients with thyroid cancer was 60.8%. Patients with BRAF V600E gene mutation had a significantly higher rate of positive cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and Ki67 markers than those without the mutation (COX-2: odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20092.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20091.27-6.74, P\u2009=\u2009.011; Ki67: OR\u2009=\u20093.41; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.31-8.88, P\u2009=\u2009.01).

This study aims to explore the expression of PDL1 in stage III breast cancer (BC) and its correlation with clinical outcome. The protein expression of PDL1 in tumor tissues was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The correlations between PDL1 and clinicopathological variables were performed by \u03c7\u00b2-tests or Fisher's exact tests. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis of the potential prognostic factors. Survival curves were estimated based on Kaplan-Meier analyses, and Log Rank test was used to contrast factors influencing the survival outcome. On the basis of the semiquantitative scoring method for PDL1 expression, the patients were divided into low PDL1 expression group (109 cases) and high PDL1 expression group (107 cases). PDL1 expression was correlated with positive lymph nodes, positive axillary lymph nodes, postoperative radiotherapy, and CK5/6 expression (P < 0.05). The PDL1 expression in tumor tissues was discovered to be a potential prognostic risk factor with the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) for stage III BC. Moreover, patients with high PDL1 expression showed longer lifetime (DFS and OS) compared to those with low PDL1 expression in total patient population (P < 0.05). Moreover, the nomogram showed that the prediction line is in good agreement with the reference line for postoperative 1-, 3-, and 5-year lifetime. The DCA curve showed that the 3- and 5-year lifetime by nomogram had so much better divination of the clinical application than only by PDL1. PDL1 is a latent prognostic factor in stage III BC and is closely related to some clinicopathological features. PDL1 expression in tumor tissues is significantly associated with better lifetime rate in stage III BC.",

        "AbstractText": "Background: Patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer (EC) typically have limited treatment options and poor long-term survival outcomes following first-line therapy. Real-world treatment patterns and survival outcomes data are limited for patients in this setting. Objectives: The objective of this retrospective study was to describe real-world demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and overall survival among patients in the United States with primary advanced or recurrent EC who initiated at least 1 line of therapy (LOT). Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of primary advanced or recurrent EC in a real-world database from January 1, 2013, to July 31, 2021, were included. The date for inclusion was the date of EC diagnosis documentation; patients were indexed for treatment patterns and outcomes at the start of the first LOT and at the start of each subsequent LOT they initiated. Data were stratified by subgroups of patients who had mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors. Results: A total of 1961 patients who received at least 1 LOT were included. Most patients in this cohort, and the dMMR/MSI-H subgroup, received a platinum combination as first-line treatment, with carboplatin-paclitaxel being the most common regimen. Only 53% of patients who received first-line treatment subsequently received second-line therapy. Of the patients who received at least 1 LOT, use of immunotherapy in the second-line setting was more common in the dMMR/MSI-H subgroup. Median overall survival ranged from 14.1 to 31.8 months across the 5 most frequently used first-line treatment regimens in the \u22651 LOT cohort and became shorter with each subsequent LOT. Discussion: The use of platinum-based chemotherapy for first-line treatment of advanced or recurrent EC predominates in the real-world setting, despite the poor long-term survival outcomes associated with most of these regimens. Conclusions: Patients with recurrent/advanced EC have a poor prognosis, highlighting the need for therapies with more durable benefits.",

        "AbstractText": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive form of primary brain tumor. Complete surgical resection of GBM is almost impossible due to the infiltrative nature of the cancer. While no evidence for recent selection events have been found after diagnosis, the selective forces that govern gliomagenesis are strong, shaping the tumor's cell composition during the initial progression to malignancy with late consequences for invasiveness and therapy response. We present a mathematical model that simulates the growth and invasion of a glioma, given its ploidy level and the nature of its brain tissue micro-environment (TME), and use it to make inferences about GBM initiation and response to standard-of-care treatment. We approximate the spatial distribution of resource access in the TME through integration of in-silico modelling, multi-omics data and image analysis of primary and recurrent GBM. In the pre-malignant setting, our in-silico results suggest that low ploidy cancer cells are more resistant to starvation-induced cell death. In the malignant setting, between first and second surgery, simulated tumors with different ploidy compositions progressed at different rates. Whether higher ploidy predicted fast recurrence, however, depended on the TME. Historical data supports this dependence on TME resources, as shown by a significant correlation between the median glucose uptake rates in human tissues and the median ploidy of cancer types that arise in the respective tissues (Spearman r = -0.70; P = 0.026). Taken together our findings suggest that availability of metabolic substrates in the TME drives different cell fate decisions for cancer cells with different ploidy and shapes GBM disease initiation and relapse characteristics.",

        "AbstractText": "Cancer patients often experience changes in mental health, prompting an exploration into whether nerves infiltrating tumors contribute to these alterations by impacting brain functions. Using a male mouse model for head and neck cancer, we utilized neuronal tracing techniques and show that tumor-infiltrating nerves indeed connect to distinct brain areas via the ipsilateral trigeminal ganglion. The activation of this neuronal circuitry led to behavioral alterations represented by decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced wheel running. Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened activity, as indicated by increased calcium mobilization. Correspondingly, the specific brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated cFos and delta FosB expression in tumor-bearing mice, alongside markedly intensified calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts. The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons in tumor-bearing mice led to decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor. While antalgic treatment successfully restored behaviors involving oral movements to normalcy in tumor-bearing mice, it did not have a similar therapeutic effect on voluntary wheel running. This discrepancy points towards an intricate relationship, where pain is not the exclusive driver of such behavioral shifts. Unraveling the interaction between the tumor, infiltrating nerves, and the brain is pivotal to developing targeted interventions to alleviate the mental health burdens associated with cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "Among the numerous changes associated with the transformation to cancer, cellular metabolism is one of the first discovered and most prominent[1, 2]. However, despite the knowledge that nearly every cancer is associated with the strong upregulation of various metabolic pathways, there has yet to be much clinical progress on the treatment of cancer by targeting a single metabolic enzyme directly[3-6]. We previously showed that inhibition of glycolysis through lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) deletion in cancer cells of origin had no effect on the initiation or progression of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma[7], suggesting that these cancers are metabolically flexible enough to produce the necessary metabolites required for sustained growth in the absence of glycolysis. Here we focused on glutaminolysis, another metabolic pathway frequently implicated as important for tumorigenesis in correlative studies. We genetically blocked glutaminolysis through glutaminase (GLS) deletion in cancer cells of origin, and found that this had little effect on tumorigenesis, similar to what we previously showed for blocking glycolysis. Tumors with genetic deletion of glutaminolysis instead upregulated lactate consumption and utilization for the TCA cycle, providing further evidence of metabolic flexibility. We also found that the metabolic flexibility observed upon inhibition of glycolysis or glutaminolysis is due to post-transcriptional changes in the levels of plasma membrane lactate and glutamine transporters. To define the limits of metabolic flexibility in cancer initiating hair follicle stem cells, we genetically blocked both glycolysis and glutaminolysis simultaneously and found that frank carcinoma was not compatible with abrogation of both of these carbon utilization pathways. These data point towards metabolic flexibility mediated by regulation of nutrient consumption, and suggest that treatment of cancer through metabolic manipulation will require multiple interventions on distinct pathways.",

We previously showed that a hypomorphic Mre11 mutant mouse strain ( Mre11 ATLD1/ATLD1 ) was highly susceptible to oncogene induced breast cancer. Here we used a mammary organoid system to examine which Mre11 dependent responses are tumor suppressive. We found that Mre11 ATLD1/ATLD1 organoids exhibited an elevated interferon stimulated gene (ISG) signature and sustained changes in chromatin accessibility. This Mre11 ATLD1/ATLD1 phenotype depended on DNA binding of a nuclear innate immune sensor, IFI205. Ablation of Ifi205 in Mre11 ATLD1/ATLD1 organoids restored baseline and oncogene-induced chromatin accessibility patterns to those observed in WT . Implantation of Mre11 ATLD1/ATLD1 organoids and activation of oncogene led to aggressive metastatic breast cancer. This outcome was reversed in implanted Ifi205 -/- Mre11 ATLD1/ATLD1 organoids. These data reveal a connection between innate immune signaling and tumor suppression in mammary epithelium. Given the abundance of aberrant DNA structures that arise in the context of genome instability syndromes, the data further suggest that cancer predisposition in those contexts may be partially attributable to tonic innate immune transcriptional programs.",

The development of improved lipid-based carriers of PTX is an important objective to generate chemotherapeutics with fewer side effects. The lipids 1,2-dioleoyl- sn -glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and glyceryl monooleate (GMO) show propensity for fusion with other lipid membranes, which has led to their use in lipid vectors of nucleic acids. We hypothesized that DOPE and GMO could enhance PTX delivery to cells through a similar membrane fusion mechanism. As an important measure of drug carrier performance, we evaluated PTX solubility in cationic liposomes containing GMO or DOPE. Solubility was determined by time-dependent kinetic phase diagrams generated from direct observations of PTX crystal formation using differential-interference-contrast optical microscopy. Remarkably, PTX was much less soluble in these liposomes than in control cationic liposomes containing univalent cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) and 1,2-dioleoyl- sn -glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), which are not fusogenic. In particular, PTX was not substantially soluble in GMO-based cationic liposomes. The fusogenicity of DOPE and GMO is related to the negative spontaneous curvature of membranes containing these lipids, which drives formation of nonlamellar self-assembled phases (inverted hexagonal or gyroid cubic). We used synchrotron small-angle x-ray scattering to determine whether PTX solubility is governed by lipid membrane structure (condensed with DNA in pellet form) or by local intermolecular interactions. The results suggest that local intermolecular interactions are of greater importance and that the negative spontaneous curvature-inducing lipids DOPE and GMO are not suitable components of lipid carriers for PTX delivery regardless of carrier structure.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of mutating S284 within the alpha-4 helix of KIF18A, which was previously identified as a phosphorylated residue. Mutations in S284 cause relocalization of KIF18A from the plus-ends of spindle microtubules to the spindle poles. Furthermore, KIF18A S284 mutants display loss of KIF18A function and fail to support proliferation in CIN tumor cells. Interestingly, similar effects on KIF18A localization and function were seen after treatment of CIN cells with KIF18A inhibitory compounds that are predicted to interact with residues within the alpha-4 helix. These data implicate the KIF18A alpha-4 helix as an effective target for inhibition and demonstrate that small molecules targeting KIF18A selectively limit CIN tumor cell proliferation and result in phenotypically similar effects on mitosis at the single cell level compared to genetic perturbations.",

        "AbstractText": "Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most prevalent brain cancer in children. Four subgroups of MB have been identified; of these, Group 3 is the most metastatic. Its genetics and biology remain less clear than the other groups, and it has a poor prognosis and few effective treatments available. Tumor hypoxia and the resulting metabolism are known to be important in the growth and survival of tumors but, to date, have been only minimally explored in MB. Here we show that Group 3 MB tumors do not depend on the canonical transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) to mount an adaptive response to hypoxia. We discovered that HIF-1\u03b1 is rendered inactive either through post-translational methylation, preventing its nuclear localization specifically in Group 3 MB, or by a low expression that prevents modulation of HIF-target genes. Strikingly, we found that HIF-2 takes over the role of HIF-1 in the nucleus and promotes the activation of hypoxia-dependent anabolic pathways. The exclusion of HIF-1 from the nucleus in Group 3 MB cells enhances the reliance on HIF-2's transcriptional role, making it a viable target for potential anticancer strategies. By combining pharmacological inhibition of HIF-2\u03b1 with the use of metformin, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor to block respiration, we effectively induced Group 3 MB cell death, surpassing the effectiveness observed in Non-Group 3 MB cells. Overall, the unique dependence of MB cells, but not normal cells, on HIF-2-mediated anabolic metabolism presents an appealing therapeutic opportunity for treating Group 3 MB patients with minimal toxicity.",

        "AbstractText": "Methylation of histone 3 lysine 36 (H3K36me) has emerged as an essential epigenetic component for the faithful regulation of gene expression. Despite its importance in development, disease, and cancer, how the molecular agents collectively shape the H3K36me landscape is unclear. We use a mouse mesenchymal stem cell model to perturb the H3K36me deposition machinery and infer the activities of the five most prominent players: SETD2, NSD1, NSD2, NSD3, and ASH1L. We find that H3K36me2 is the most abundant of the three methylation states and is predominantly deposited at intergenic regions by NSD1, and partly by NSD2. In contrast, H3K36me1/3 are most abundant within exons and are positively correlated with gene expression. We demonstrate that while SETD2 deposits most H3K36me3, it also deposits H3K36me2 within transcribed genes. Additionally, loss of SETD2 results in an increase of exonic H3K36me1, suggesting other H3K36 methyltransferases (K36MTs) prime gene bodies with lower methylation states ahead of transcription. Through a reductive approach, we uncover the distribution patterns of NSD3- and ASH1L-catalyzed H3K36me2. While NSD1/2 establish broad intergenic H3K36me2 domains, NSD3 deposits H3K36me2 peaks on active promoters and enhancers. Meanwhile, the activity of ASH1L is restricted to the regulatory elements of developmentally relevant genes, and our analyses implicate PBX2 as a potential recruitment factor. Within genes, SETD2 deposits both H3K36me2/3, while the other K36MTs are capable of depositing H3K36me1/2 independently of SETD2 activity. For the deposition of H3K36me1/2, we find a hierarchy of K36MT activities where NSD1>NSD2>NSD3>ASH1L. While NSD1 and NSD2 are responsible for most genome-wide propagation of H3K36me2, the activities of NSD3 and ASH1L are confined to active regulatory elements.",

Direct OC2 targets include the glucocorticoid receptor and the NE splicing factor SRRM4, among others. OC2 regulates gene expression by promoter binding, enhancement of chromatin accessibility, and formation of novel super-enhancers. OC2 also activates glucuronidation genes that irreversibly disable androgen, thereby evoking phenotypic heterogeneity indirectly by hormone depletion. Pharmacologic inhibition of OC2 suppresses lineage plasticity reprogramming induced by the AR signaling inhibitor enzalutamide. These results demonstrate that OC2 activation promotes a range of drug resistance mechanisms associated with treatment-emergent lineage variation in PC.

Early detection of HGOC usually leads to a cure, yet it remains a clinical challenge with over 90% HGOCs diagnosed at advanced stages. This is mainly because conventional biomarkers are not sensitive to detect the microscopic yet metastatic early HGOC lesions. In this study, we sequenced the blood T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of 466 ovarian cancer patients and controls, and systematically investigated the immune repertoire signatures in HGOCs. We observed quantifiable changes of selected TCRs in HGOCs that are reproducible in multiple independent cohorts. Importantly, these changes are stronger during stage I. Using pre-diagnostic patient blood samples from the Nurses' Health Study, we confirmed that HGOC signals can be detected in the blood TCR repertoire up to 4 years proceeding conventional diagnosis. Our findings may provide the basis of an immune-based HGOC early detection criterion. We made an unprecedented discovery that a strong and quantifiable change in the blood TCR repertoire occurs 4 to 2 years before high grade ovarian cancers could be diagnosed with conventional clinical tests.

Our studies of human tissues, with validation in a large external data set, revealed that cancer cell-intrinsic activation of MYC signaling was the top up-regulated pathway in human cancers, representing a common denominator across the well-known molecular and pathological heterogeneity of human prostate cancer. Likewise, numerous non-malignant cell states in the tumor microenvironment (TME), including non-cancerous epithelial, immune, and fibroblast cell compartments, were conserved across individuals, raising the possibility that these cell types may be a sequelae of the convergent MYC activation in the cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we employed a GEMM of prostate epithelial cell-specific MYC activation in two mouse strains. Cell communication network and pathway analyses suggested that MYC oncogene-expressing neoplastic cells, directly and indirectly, reprogrammed the TME during carcinogenesis, leading to the emergence of cascading cell state alterations in neighboring epithelial, immune, and fibroblast cell types that paralleled key findings in human prostate cancer. Importantly, among these changes, the progression from a precursor-enriched to invasive-cancer-enriched state was accompanied by a cell-intrinsic switch from pro-immunogenic to immunosuppressive transcriptional programs with coinciding enrichment of immunosuppressive myeloid and Treg cells in the immune microenvironment. These findings implicate activation of MYC signaling in reshaping convergent aspects of the TME of prostate cancer as a common denominator across the otherwise well-documented molecular heterogeneity of human prostate cancer.",

        "ArticleTitle": "The accuracy of anal self- and companion exams among sexual minority men and transgender women: The Prevent Anal Cancer Palpation Study.",
        "AbstractText": "Squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (SCCA) annual incidence among sexual minority men (SMM) with and without HIV is 85/100,000 and 19/100,000 persons, respectively, which is significantly higher than the overall incidence (2/100,000). Since SCCA tumours average \u226530 mm at diagnosis, we assessed the accuracy of individuals to self-detect anal abnormalities. The study enrolled 714 SMM and transgender women (SMM/TW), aged 25 to 81 years, in Chicago, Illinois and Houston, Texas during 2020-2022. Individuals were taught the anal self- and companion examinations (ASE/ACE). Then, a clinician performed a digital anal rectal examination (DARE) before participants conducted the ASE or ACE. Accuracy was measured along with factors associated with ASE/ACE and DARE concordance. The median age was 40 years (interquartile range, 32-54), 36.8% were living with HIV, and 47.0%, 23.4%, and 23.0% were non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic. Clinicians detected 245 individuals with abnormalities (median diameter 3 mm). Sensitivity and specificity of the ASE/ACE was 59.6% (95%CI 53.5-65.7%) and 80.2% (95%CI 76.6-83.8%), respectively. Overall concordance was 0.73 (95% CI 0.70-0.76) between ASE/ACE and DARE and increased with increasing anal canal lesion size (p=0.02). However, concordance was lower for participants aged \u226555 years (compared to 25-34 years) and when the ASE/ACE trainer was a lay person rather than a clinician. SMM/TW who complete an ASE or ACE are likely to detect SCCA at an early stage when malignant lesions are much smaller than the current median dimension at presentation of \u226530 mm. National Cancer Institute. Evidence before this study: While squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (SCCA) incidence is substantially elevated in people with HIV, there are currently no consensus recommendations on how to screen for it, nor is there widespread technological infrastructure for one prevailing method, high-resolution anoscopy. In the absence of screening programs, the size of SCCA tumours at diagnosis are > 30 mm. We searched PubMed for articles between January 1, 2000 and June 15, 2023 using the search terms 'anus neoplasm' and 'self-examination'. We found no studies assessing the accuracy of self-examinations to detect anal masses other than our prior feasibility study.Added value of this study: The primary goal of the Prevent Anal Cancer Palpation Study was to assess the accuracy of lay self-examinations and companion examinations to recognise abnormalities in the anal region. Clinicians conducted a digital anal rectal examination and recorded all lesions observed at the perianus or anal canal. The median size of lesions was 3 mm. Participants conducted lay examinations and these results were judged against a clinician's examination. The sensitivity and specificity of the lay examinations, for any lesion at the anal canal or perianal region was 59.6% and 80.1%, respectively. As lesions increased in size, concordance increased between clinician's exam and the lay exam.Implications of all the available evidence: It is now known that high-resolution anoscopy can reduce the risk for SCCA but the infrastructure using this technology is very limited in high-resource settings and almost non-existent in low resource settings, especially where HIV prevalence is highest. The evidence suggests that self- and partner examination of the anal region is feasible and that lay persons can detect lesions that are much smaller than the prevailing size of SCCA tumours.",

Here, we developed a new bioinformatic tool to detect transposon-fusion transcripts in RNA-sequencing data and performed a pan-cancer analysis of 10,257 cancer samples across 34 cancer types as well as 3,088 normal tissue samples. We identified 52,277 cancer-specific fusions with \u223c30 events per cancer and hotspot loci within transposons vulnerable to fusion formation. Exonization of intronic transposons was the most prevalent genic fusions, while somatic L1 insertions constituted a small fraction of cancer-specific fusions. Source L1s and HERVs, but not Alus showed decreased DNA methylation in cancer upon fusion formation. Overall cancer-specific L1 fusions were enriched in tumor suppressors while Alu fusions were enriched in oncogenes, including recurrent Alu fusions in EZH2 predictive of patient survival. We also demonstrated that transposon-derived peptides triggered CD8+ T-cell activation to the extent comparable to EBV viruses. Our findings reveal distinct epigenetic and tumorigenic mechanisms underlying transposon fusions across different families and highlight transposons as novel therapeutic targets and the source of potent neoantigens.",

        "AbstractText": "Cisplatin is a common chemotherapy drug with a nearly universal side effect of ototoxicity. The cellular mechanisms underlying cisplatin ototoxicity are poorly understood. Efforts in drug development to prevent or reverse cisplatin ototoxicity have largely focused on pathways of oxidative stress and apoptosis. An effective treatment for cisplatin ototoxicity, sodium thiosulfate, is associated with reduced survival in disseminated hepatoblastoma, highlighting the need for more specific drugs. The unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of noise-induced hearing loss and cochlear synaptopathy in vivo , and these pathways have been implicated broadly in cisplatin cytotoxicity. This study sought to determine whether the UPR can be targeted to prevent cisplatin ototoxicity. Neonatal cochlear cultures and HEK cells were exposed to cisplatin and UPR-modulating drugs, and UPR marker gene expression and cell death measured. Treatment with ISRIB, a drug that activates eif2B and downregulates the pro-apoptotic PERK/CHOP pathway of the UPR, was tested in an in vivo mouse model of cisplatin ototoxicity and well as a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell-based assay of cisplatin cytotoxicity. Cisplatin exhibited a biphasic, non-linear dose-response of cell death and apoptosis that correlated with different patterns of UPR marker gene expression in HEK cells and cochlear cultures. ISRIB treatment protected against cisplatin-induced hearing loss and hair-cell death, but did not impact cisplatin's cytotoxic effects on HNSCC cell viability. These findings demonstrate that targeting the pro-apoptotic PERK/CHOP pathway with ISRIB can mitigate cisplatin ototoxicity without reducing anti-cancer cell effects, suggesting that this may be a viable strategy for drug development.",

Targeting peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes offers a promising strategy for immunotherapy due to its specificity and effectiveness against cancer. In this work, we exploit the acidic tumor micro-environment to selectively deliver antigenic peptides to cancer cells using pH(low) insertion peptides (pHLIP). We demonstrated that the delivery of MHC binding peptides directly to the cytoplasm of melanoma cells resulted in the presentation of antigenic peptides on MHC, and subsequent activation of T cells. This work highlights the potential of pHLIP as a vehicle for targeted delivery of antigenic peptides and their presentation via MHC-bound complexes on cancer cell surfaces for activation of T cells with implications for enhancing anti-cancer immunotherapy.",

        "AbstractText": "Immune-based therapies induce durable remissions in subsets of patients across multiple malignancies. However, there is limited efficacy of immunotherapy in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), manifested by an enrichment of immunosuppressive (M2) tumor- associated macrophages (TAM) in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME). Therefore, therapeutic strategies to overcome TAM-mediated immunosuppression are critically needed in mCRPC. Here we discovered that NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), an innate immune sensing protein, is highly expressed in TAM from metastatic PC patients treated with standard-of-care androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Importantly, ex vivo studies revealed that androgen receptor (AR) blockade in TAM upregulates NLRP3 expression, but not inflammasome activity, and concurrent AR blockade/NLRP3 agonist (NLRP3a) treatment promotes cancer cell phagocytosis by immunosuppressive M2 TAM. In contrast, NLRP3a monotherapy was sufficient to enhance phagocytosis of cancer cells in anti-tumor (M1) TAM, which exhibit high de novo NLRP3 expression. Critically, combinatorial treatment with ADT/NLRP3a in a murine model of advanced PC resulted in significant tumor control, with tumor clearance in 55% of mice via TAM phagocytosis. Collectively, our results demonstrate NLRP3 as an AR-regulated \"macrophage phagocytic checkpoint\", inducibly expressed in TAM by ADT and activated by NLRP3a treatment, the combination resulting in TAM-mediated phagocytosis and tumor control.",

Proteasome inhibitors have emerged as effective cancer therapeutics, but how they work mechanistically remains unclear. Here, using integrative genomic analysis, we discovered unexpected reprogramming of the chromatin landscape and RNAPII transcription initiation in breast cancer cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. The cells acquired dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility at specific genomic loci termed Differentially Open Chromatin Regions (DOCRs). DOCRs with decreased accessibility were promoter proximal and exhibited unique chromatin architecture associated with divergent RNAPII transcription. Conversely, DOCRs with increased accessibility were primarily distal to transcription start sites and enriched in oncogenic super enhancers predominantly accessible in non-basal breast tumor subtypes. These findings describe the mechanisms by which the proteasome modulates the expression of gene networks intrinsic to breast cancer biology.

        "AbstractText": "There is tremendous need for improved prostate cancer (PCa) models. The mouse prostate does not spontaneously form tumors and is anatomically and developmentally different from the human prostate. Engineered mouse models lack the heterogeneity of human cancer and rarely establish metastatic growth. Human xenografts represent an alternative but rely on an immunocompromised host. Accordingly, we generated PCa murine xenograft models with an intact human immune system (huNOG and huNOG-EXL mice) to test whether humanizing tumor-immune interactions would improve modeling of metastatic PCa and the impact of hormonal and immunotherapies. These mice maintain multiple human cell lineages, including functional human T-cells and myeloid cells. In 22Rv1 xenografts, subcutaneous tumor size was not significantly altered across conditions; however, metastasis to secondary sites differed in castrate huNOG vs background-matched immunocompromised mice treated with enzalutamide (enza). VCaP xenograft tumors showed decreases in growth with enza and anti-Programed-Death-1 treatments in huNOG mice, and no effect was seen with treatment in NOG mice. Enza responses in huNOG and NOG mice were distinct and associated with increased T-cells within tumors of enza treated huNOG mice, and increased T-cell activation. In huNOG-EXL mice, which support human myeloid development, there was a strong population of immunosuppressive regulatory T-cells and Myeloid-Derived-Suppressor-Cells (MDSCs), and enza treatment showed no difference in metastasis. Results illustrate, to our knowledge, the first model of human PCa that metastasizes to clinically relevant locations, has an intact human immune system, responds appropriately to standard-of-care hormonal therapies, and can model both an immunosuppressive and checkpoint-inhibition responsive immune microenvironment.",

We leverage information on the phylogenetic tree structure to flexibly aggregate rare features. We demonstrate through simulation studies that TARO accurately recovers a low-rank coefficient matrix and identifies relevant features.

Our analyses revealed multiple neojunctions that recur across patients and either exhibited intratumor heterogeneity or, in some cases, were tumor-wide. We identified CD8+ T-cell clones specific for neoantigens derived from tumor-wide and conserved neojunctions in GNAS and RPL22 , respectively. TCR-engineered CD8 + T-cells targeting these mutations conferred neoantigen-specific tumor cell eradication. Furthermore, we revealed that cancer-specific dysregulation in splicing factor expression leads to recurrent neojunction expression.

        "AbstractText": "Currently there are no biomarkers to identify resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with hormone-naive prostate cancer. 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC) in the gene body are associated with gene activation and are critical for epigenomic regulation of cancer progression. To evaluate whether 5hmC signature in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) predicts early ADT resistance. Serial plasma samples from 55 prostate cancer patients receiving ADT were collected at three timepoints including baseline (prior to initiating ADT, N=55), 3-month (after initiating ADT, N=55), and disease progression (N=15) within 24 months or 24-month if no progression was detected (N=14). 20 of the 55 patients showed disease progression during the 24-month follow-up. The remaining 35 patients showed no progression in the same follow-up period. cfDNA (5-10ng) was used for selective chemical labeling (hMe-Seal) sequencing to map 5hmC abundance across the genome. Read counts in gene bodies were normalized with DESeq2. Differential methylation and gene set enrichment analyses were performed to identify the 5hmC-enriched genes and biological processes that were associated with disease progression. Kaplan-Meir analysis was utilized to determine the association of 5hmC signatures with progression-free survival. 5hmC-sequencing generated an average of 18.6 (range 6.03 to 42.43) million reads per sample with 98% (95-99%) mappable rate. Baseline sample comparisons identified significant 5hmC difference in 1,642 of 23,433 genes between 20 patients with progression and 35 patients without progression (false discovery rate, FDR<0.1). Patients with progression showed significant enrichments in multiple hallmark gene sets with androgen responses as the top enriched gene set (FDR=1.19E-13). Interestingly, this enrichment was driven by a subgroup of patients with disease progression featuring a significant 5hmC hypermethylation of the gene sets involving AR , FOXA1 and GRHL2 . To quantify overall activities of these gene sets, we developed a gene set activity score algorithm using a mean value of log2 ratios of gene read counts in an entire gene set. We found that the activity scores in these gene sets were significantly higher in this subgroup of patients with progression than in the remaining patients regardless of the progression status. Furthermore, the high activity scores in these gene sets were associated with poor progression-free survival (p <0.05). Longitudinal analysis showed that activity scores in this subgroup with progression were significantly reduced after 3-month ADT but returned to high levels when the disease was progressed. 5hmC-sequencing in cfDNA identified a subgroup of prostate cancer patients with preexisting activation (5hmC hypermethylation) of gene sets involving AR , FOXA1 and GRHL2 before initiating ADT. Activity scores in these gene sets may serve as sensitive biomarkers to determine treatment resistance, monitor disease progression and potentially identify patients who would benefit from upfront treatment intensification. More studies are needed to validate this initial finding. There are no clinical tests to identify prostate cancer patients who will develop early resistance to androgen deprivation therapy within 24 months. In this study, we evaluated cell-free DNA epigenomic modification in blood and identified significant enrichment of 5-hydroxymethylation in androgen response genes in a subgroup of patients with treatment resistance. High level 5-hydroxylmethylation in these genes may serve as a discriminative biomarker to diagnose patients who are likely to experience early failure during androgen deprivation therapy.",

Current fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) systems, however, rely on bulky and rigid optics that incur performance-limiting trade-offs between sensitivity and maneuverability. Moreover, many FGS systems are incapable of multiplexed imaging. As a result, clinical FGS is currently limited to millimeter-scale detection of a single fluorescent target. Here we present a scalable, lens-less fluorescence imaging chip, VISION, capable of highly sensitive and multiplexed detection within a compact form factor. Central to VISION is a novel optical frontend design combining a low-numerical-aperture fiber optic plate (LNA-FOP) and a multi-bandpass interference filter, which is directly integrated on a custom-designed image sensor. The LNA-FOP acts as a planar collimator to improve resolution and compensate for the angle-sensitivity of the interference filter, enabling high-resolution and multiplexed fluorescence imaging without lenses. We show VISION is capable of highly sensitive detection of tumor foci of less than 100 cells at near video framerates and, as proof of principle, can simultaneously visualize both tumor and nerves in ex vivo prostate tissue.",

        "AbstractText": "Cancer cells expand rapidly in response to altered intercellular and signalling interactions to achieve hallmarks of cancer. Impaired cell polarity combined with activated oncogenes is known to promote several hallmarks of cancer e.g., activating invasion by increased activity of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and sustained proliferative signalling by increased activity of Hippo effector Yorkie (Yki). Thus, JNK, Yki, and their downstream transcription factors have emerged as synergistic drivers of tumour growth through pro-tumour signalling and intercellular interactions like cell-competition. However, little is known about the signals that converge onto JNK and Yki in tumour cells that enable the tumour cells to achieve hallmarks of cancer. Here, using mosaic models of cooperative oncogenesis ( Ras V12 , scrib - ) in Drosophila , we show that Ras V12 , scrib - tumour cells grow by activation of a previously unidentified network comprising Wingless (Wg), Dronc, JNK and Yki. We show that Ras V12 , scrib - cells show increased Wg, Dronc, JNK, and Yki signalling, and all of these signals are required for the growth of Ras V12 , scrib - tumours. We report that Wg and Dronc converge onto a JNK-Yki self-reinforcing positive feedback signal-amplification loop that promotes tumour growth. We found that Wg-Dronc-Yki-JNK molecular network is specifically activated in polarity-impaired tumour cells and not in normal cells where apical basal polarity is intact. Our findings suggest that identification of molecular networks may provide significant insights about the key biologically meaningful changes in signalling pathways, and paradoxical signals that promote Tumourigenesis.",

Claudin is one of the primary proteins that make up tight junctions, and it plays crucial roles in anti-inflammatory and antitumor responses as well as the maintenance of water and electrolyte balance. Decreased expression of claudin results in the disruption of tight junction structures and the activation of downstream signaling pathways, which can lead to tumor formation. The origin of Claudin-low breast cancer is still in dispute. Claudin-low breast cancer is characterized by low expression of Claudin3, 4, 7, E-cadherin, and HER2 and high expression of Vimentin, Snai 1/2, Twist 1/2, Zeb 1/2, and ALDH1, as well as stem cell characteristics. The clinical onset of claudin-low breast cancer is at menopause age, and its histological grade is higher. This subtype of breast cancer is more likely to spread to lymph nodes than other subtypes. Claudin-low breast cancer is frequently accompanied by increased invasiveness and a poor prognosis. According to a clinical retrospective analysis, claudin-low breast cancer can achieve low pathological complete remission. At present, although several therapeutic targets of claudin-low breast cancer have been identified, the effective treatment remains in basic research stages, and no animal studies or clinical trials have been designed. The origin, molecular biological characteristics, pathological characteristics, treatment, and prognosis of CLBC are extensively discussed in this article.

While a first preclinical murine tumor type showed significant improved control with hypoxic tumor boosts, a more thorough investigation of efficacy from boosting hypoxic subvolumes defined by electron paramagnetic resonance oxygen imaging (EPROI) is necessary. The present study confirms improved hypoxic tumor control results in three different tumor types using a clonogenic assay and explores potential confounding experimental conditions. Three murine tumor models were used for multi-modal imaging and radiotherapy: MCa-4 mammary adenocarcinomas, SCC7 squamous cell carcinomas, and FSa fibrosarcomas. Registered T2-weighted MRI tumor boundaries, hypoxia defined by EPROI as pO2 \u2264 10 mmHg, and X-RAD 225Cx CT boost boundaries were obtained for all animals. 13 Gy boosts were directed to hypoxic or equal-integral-volume oxygenated tumor regions and monitored for regrowth. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess local tumor control probability (LTCP). The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the hazard ratio of tumor progression of Hypoxic Boost vs. Oxygenated Boost for each tumor type controlling for experimental confounding variables such as EPROI radiofrequency, tumor volume, hypoxic fraction, and delay between imaging and radiation treatment. An overall significant increase in LTCP from Hypoxia Boost vs. Oxygenated Boost treatments was observed in the full group of three tumor types (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The effects of tumor volume and hypoxic fraction on LTCP were dependent on tumor type. The delay between imaging and boost treatments did not have a significant effect on LTCP for all tumor types. This study confirms that EPROI locates resistant tumor hypoxic regions for radiation boost, increasing clonogenic LTCP, with potential enhanced therapeutic index in three tumor types.

Due to the altered path and intensity of sonication penetrating the skull, the focus and intensity in the skull are difficult to determine, making the use of ultrasound therapy for cancer treatment experimental and not widely available. The deficiency can be effectively addressed by numerical simulation methods, which enable the optimization of sonication modulation parameters and the determination of precise transducer positioning. A 3D skull model was established using binarized brain CT images. The selection of the transducer matrix was performed using the radius positioning (RP) method after identifying the intracranial target region. Simulations were performed, encompassing acoustic pressure (AP), acoustic field, and temperature field, in order to provide compelling evidence of the safety of tFUS in sonication-induced thermal effects. It was found that the angle of sonication path to the coronal plane obtained at all precision and frequency models did not exceed 10\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 to the transverse plane. The results of thermal effects illustrated that the peak temperatures of tFUS were 43.73\u00b0C, which did not reach the point of tissue degeneration. Once positioned, tFUS effectively delivers a Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) stimulation that targets tumors with diameters of up to 3.72\u2009mm in a one-off. The original precision model showed an attenuation of 24.47\u2009\u00b1\u20096.13\u2009mm in length and 2.40\u2009\u00b1\u20091.42\u2009mm in width for the FWHM of sonication after penetrating the skull.

It has been suggested that when time is limited for precise transducer positioning, fixing the transducer on the horizontal surface of the target region can also yield positive results for stimulation. This framework used a new transducer localization method to offer a reliable basis for further research and offered new methods for the use of tFUS in brain tumor-related research.",

        "AbstractText": "Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a commonly used tumor marker in cancer screening. However, it has also been associated with metabolic alterations. Hepatic steatosis, the accumulation of fat in liver cells, is associated with various cardiovascular risk factors. This study investigated the risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) in individuals with elevated CEA levels, hepatic steatosis, and their co-occurrence. The study cohort comprised 5,580 Korean adults who underwent health examinations between November 2006 and June 2010. Data regarding baseline CEA levels, hepatic steatosis status, and development of IHD were collected. Hepatic steatosis was defined as more than two findings: deep attenuation, vascular blurring, and increased liver echogenicity on abdominal ultrasound. Participants were divided into four groups based on their CEA and hepatic steatosis status: no hepatic steatosis and low CEA (group 1), no hepatic steatosis and elevated CEA (group 2), low CEA and hepatic steatosis (group 3), and elevated CEA and hepatic steatosis (group 4). A total of 226 (4.1%) participants developed IHD during the follow-up period. Participants with elevated CEA levels and hepatic steatosis (group 4) had the highest cumulative incidence of IHD in comparison to other groups (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The combined effect of elevated CEA levels and hepatic steatosis showed significantly greater area under the receiver operating characteristic curve than hepatic steatosis alone (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Furthermore, participants with elevated CEA and hepatic steatosis (group 4) had higher risk of developing IHD compared to those with low CEA and no hepatic steatosis (group 1) (hazard ratio: 1.63, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-2.55, p\u2009=\u20090.034). Co-occurrence of elevated CEA levels and hepatic steatosis increases the risk of IHD. Comprehensive risk assessment is crucial to guide interventions and improve cardiovascular health in individuals with both the conditions.",

        "AbstractText": "This study aimed to elucidate the effects of long-term day and night shifts on liver function and lipid metabolism in a group of nurses. This cross-sectional study in December 2019 was based on a group of nurses. A total of 1,253 physically healthy caregivers were included, including 1231 women and 22 men. A total of 886 nurses had long-term shift work (working in a rotating system for >1 year). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate factors related to long-term shift work. We observed differences in liver and kidney indicators between the non-night and night shift groups. The ROC curve revealed that CHO (AUC: 62.4%), LDLC (AUC: 62%), and GLUO (AUC: 61.5%) were more related to the night shift. Logistic regression analysis showed that night shift work was associated significantly with CREA (log (OR) = -0.02, 95% CI: -0.04 to -0.01), CHO (log (OR) = -0.38, 95% CI: -0.67 to -0.09), and GLUO (log (OR) = -0.35, 95% CI: -0.56 to -0.17). This correlation was observed only for CHO and LDHC (CHO: log (OR) = -0.55, 95% CI: -0.98 to -0.12; LDLC: log (OR) = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.32, 1.4) after age standardization. After using propensity score matching, we did not find evidence to support that the indicators differed between night and non-night shift groups. Our study observed an association of long-term night work with abnormal liver and kidney function and dyslipidemia, but the difference was not significant after strict age matching. Although these findings may support interventions for long-term night shift nurses, more detailed studies are needed to confirm.",

Senescent cells undergo altered gene expression and release inflammatory mediators collectively termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which significantly contributes to a spectrum of age-related disorders, including cancer. In the context of carcinogenesis, the SASP produced by senescent cells has been implicated in the promotion of epithelial cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the most common form of oral cancer. Senescent cells within the tumor microenvironment release factors that amplify the growth and invasiveness of neighboring cancer cells. Senotherapeutics, including senolytics and senomorphics, emerge as promising modalities to target senescent cells and their associated inflammatory factors, thereby opening novel avenues for augmenting the efficacy of cancer treatments. Here, we review the general aspects of cellular senescence, focusing on the relation between senescence-related inflammation with cancer development.

        "AbstractText": "Lentiviral vectors (LV) have become the dominant tool for stable gene transfer into lymphocytes including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) gene delivery to T cells, a major breakthrough in cancer therapy. Yet, room for improvement remains, especially for the latest LV generations delivering genes selectively into T cell subtypes, a key requirement for in vivo CAR T cell generation. Toward improving gene transfer rates with these vectors, whole transcriptome analyses on human T lymphocytes are conducted after exposure to CAR-encoding conventional vectors (VSV-LV) and vectors targeted to CD8+ (CD8-LV) or CD4+ T cells (CD4-LV). Genes related to quiescence and antiviral restriction are found to be upregulated in CAR-negative cells exposed to all types of LVs. Down-modulation of various antiviral restriction factors, including the interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) is achieved with rapamycin as verified by mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Strikingly, rapamycin enhances transduction by up to 7-fold for CD8-LV and CD4-LV without compromising CAR T cell activities but does not improve VSV-LV. When administered to humanized mice, CD8-LV results in higher rates of green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene delivery. Also in vivo CAR T cell generation is improved in kinetics and tumor control, however to a moderate extent, leaving room for improvement by optimizing the rapamycin administration schedule. The data favor multi-omics approaches for improvements in gene delivery.",

        "AbstractText": "Naringenin is widely recognized for its notable attributes, including anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and immunomodulatory activities. However, its specific implications for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the underlying mechanisms remain to be explored. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and pharmacological mechanism of Naringenin in the treatment of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). A CIA model was established in DBA/1 mice, and various doses of Naringenin were administered orally to assess its impact on RA. The study also involved lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells to further evaluate the effects of Naringenin. Mechanistic studies were conducted to elucidate the signaling pathways involved in Naringenin's actions. Naringenin significantly alleviated foot inflammation in DBA/1 CIA mice and attenuated the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum. It also enhanced antioxidant capacity in the CIA model. In vitro studies with LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells demonstrated that Naringenin attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Mechanistic studies confirmed that Naringenin activated autophagy and increased autophagic flux. Blocking autophagy, either by silencing Atg5 or inhibiting autophagolysosome using chloroquine, effectively counteracted the impact of Naringenin on pro-inflammatory cytokines. Further exploration revealed that Naringenin activated the AMPK/ULK1 signaling pathway, and inhibition of AMPK reversed the initiation of autophagy and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion induced by Naringenin. This study unveils a novel mechanism by which Naringenin may be used to treat RA. It demonstrates the therapeutic efficacy of Naringenin in a CIA model by reducing inflammation, modulating cytokine levels, and enhancing antioxidant capacity. Moreover, the activation of autophagy through the AMPK/ULK1 signaling pathway appears to play a critical role in Naringenin's anti-inflammatory effects. These findings suggest potential strategies for the development of anti-rheumatic medications based on Naringenin.",

In this study, 100 patients diagnosed as recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer in our hospital and 100 patients without recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer in the same period were selected. According to the treatment plan, the recurrent patients were divided into conventional therapy group (Paclitaxel and Carboplatin) and combined therapy group (Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, and olaparib). The levels of serum inflammatory factors were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The peripheral blood T-lymphocyte subsets in each group were detected by flow cytometry. Compared with nonrecurrent patients, recurrent patients have higher serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) levels (p\u2009<\u2009.05), and lower interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) level and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio. After adjusting for confounding factors, the results showed that the serum IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 levels were influencing factors of recurrence in epithelial ovarian cancer patients. The area under the receiver operating curve and the sensitivity of serum TNF-\u03b1 in predicting ovarian cancer recurrence were higher than those of IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3. After secondary chemotherapy and/or olaparib maintenance treatment, the IL-6 (p\u2009<\u2009.001) and TNF-\u03b1 (p\u2009<\u2009.001) levels in combined therapy group were lower than those in the conventional therapy, whereas the IFN-\u03b3 level (p\u2009<\u2009.001), the CD4+ T-cell proportion (p\u2009=\u2009.0069) and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio (p\u2009=\u2009.0201) were higher than those in the conventional therapy. The serum IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 levels were closely related to the recurrence of ovarian cancer.

A total of 531 subjects who received physical examination in our center from April 2019 to December 2019 were enrolled in the study. All subjects were tested for G17, pepsinogen I (PGI), pepsinogen II (PGII), PGI/PGII ratio (PGR), H. pylori, serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The difference of G17 secretion in different subjects and its correlation with PG were analyzed to investigate H. pylori infection and expound the effects of inflammatory indicators on G17. There was no significant difference in G17 secretion level in people with different sex, age and BMI (p\u2009>\u2009.05).

We assessed the impact of ePLND on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and the distribution of recurrences (locoregional and distant recurrences). The secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). We performed propensity score matching using covariates associated with the extent of PLND on univariable logistic regression analysis. The association of the extent of PLND with RFS and OS was investigated using Cox regression models. Of 969 cN+ patients, 510 were 1:1 matched on propensity scores. Median time to recurrence was 8 months (IQR 4-16), and median follow-up of alive patients was 30 months (IQR 13-51).

However, the mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction during cancer progression are far from being clarified. Here, it is demonstrated that the expression level of succinyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase GDP-forming subunit \u03b2 (SUCLG2) can affect the overall succinylation of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells. Succinylome analysis shows that the deletion of SUCLG2 can upregulate the succinylation level of mitochondrial proteins and inhibits the function of key metabolic enzymes by reducing either enzymatic activity or protein stability, thus dampening mitochondrial function in LUAD cells. Interestingly, SUCLG2 itself is also succinylated on Lys93, and this succinylation enhances its protein stability, leading to the upregulation of SUCLG2 and promoting the proliferation and tumorigenesis of LUAD cells. Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) desuccinylates SUCLG2 on Lys93, followed by tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21)-mediated ubiquitination through K63-linkage and degradation in the lysosome. The findings reveal a new role for SUCLG2 in mitochondrial dysfunction and clarify the mechanism of the succinylation-mediated protein homeostasis of SUCLG2 in LUAD, thus providing a theoretical basis for developing anti-cancer drugs targeting SUCLG2.",

The ability to draw meaningful conclusions from EMA research depends upon participant compliance with assessment completion. Most EMA studies provide financial compensation for compliance, but little empirical evidence addresses the impact of reinforcement parameters on the level of compliance. The purpose of this study-within-a-trial was to determine the effects of varying the amount and frequency of reinforcement on EMA compliance in a clinical sample of individuals seeking treatment for cigarette smoking. In the parent clinical trial, participants were asked to complete 9 weeks of EMA (1 daily Morning Assessment and 4 daily Random Assessments). Following a 5-week Standard Payment phase for EMA compliance, 61 individuals seeking treatment for cigarette smoking enrolled in the larger clinical trial were randomized to receive Standard ($1 per assessment, paid biweekly), Frequent ($1 per assessment, paid 3 times per week), or Large ($2 per assessment, paid biweekly) payments for EMA compliance during a 4-week Payment Manipulation Phase. Overall, receiving Frequent or Large payments did not improve EMA compliance compared to Standard payments, Ps\u2005>\u2005.30. Varying frequency and amount of remuneration for EMA compliance did not generally improve compliance in an ongoing clinical trial, raising further questions about the importance of reinforcement parameters in promoting EMA compliance. Previous studies have addressed the idea that monetary compensation for participation in research is an effective way to encourage individuals to complete the studies. However, there has been limited exploration as whether the amount and frequency of compensation has an influence on participant adherence. We recruited adults who were seeking cigarette smoking treatment and asked them to complete multiple assessments each day on a smartphone app for 9 weeks. Following completion of the assessments, participants were given monetary compensation. A change after 5 weeks led to some persons receiving $1 per assessment paid three times a week (Frequent Payment Group), while others received $2 per assessment paid biweekly (Large Payment Group), and some continued to receive $1 per assessment paid biweekly (Standard Payment Group) for the next 4 weeks. We found that the experimental payment variations did not significantly change compliance with the assessments. These preliminary findings serve as a benchmark for further research.",

We conducted a retrospective study using tissue samples at relapse for patients with R/R DLBCL (n\u2009=\u200945) and evaluated the clinical impact of PD-1 expression on tumour-infiltrating non-malignant cells (microenvironmental PD-1, mPD-1). In addition, corresponding 27 samples at diagnosis were analysed to evaluate the changes in PD-1/PD-L1 expression in the TME after chemotherapy. Patients with mPD-1+ DLBCL showed significantly better overall survival compared with patients with mPD-1- DLBCL (hazard ratio, 0.30, p\u2009=\u20090.03). Among patients with mPD-1- DLBCL, those positive for neoplastic or microenvironmental PD-L1 (nPD-L1+ or mPD-L1+ ) showed significantly worse outcomes. Microenvironmental PD-1 and PD-L1 expression has high correlation at relapse, although none was found at diagnosis. We determined the clinical impact of microenvironmental PD-1 expression and its relationship with neoplastic or microenvironmental expression of PD-L1 in patients with R/R DLBCL. The expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in the TME dramatically changes during the chemotherapy. Therefore, evaluating TME at relapse, not at diagnosis is useful to predict the outcomes of R/R DLBCL patients.",

        "AbstractText": "The brain is constituted of heterogeneous types of neuronal and non-neuronal cells, which are organized into distinct anatomical regions, and show precise regulation of gene expression during development, aging\u00a0and function. In the current database release, STAB2 provides a systematic cellular map of the human and mouse brain by integrating recently published large-scale single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing datasets from diverse regions and across lifespan. We applied a hierarchical strategy of unsupervised clustering on the integrated single-cell transcriptomic datasets to precisely annotate the cell types and subtypes in the human and mouse brain. Currently, STAB2 includes 71 and 61 different cell subtypes defined in the human and mouse brain, respectively. It covers 63 subregions and 15 developmental stages of human brain, and 38 subregions and 30 developmental stages of mouse brain, generating a comprehensive atlas for exploring spatiotemporal transcriptomic dynamics in the mammalian brain. We also augmented web interfaces for querying and visualizing the gene expression in specific cell types. STAB2 is freely available at https://mai.fudan.edu.cn/stab2.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Time trends in human papillomavirus prevalence and genotype distribution in vulvar carcinoma in Norway.",
        "AbstractText": "Approximately 25%-43% of all vulvar carcinomas are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). In many countries, vulvar carcinoma incidence rates are increasing, possibly due to greater HPV exposure. However, studies exploring changes in HPV prevalence and genotype distribution in vulvar carcinoma over time are scarce. Our aim was to evaluate time trends in HPV prevalence and genotype distribution in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma in an unselected, nationwide sample of Norwegian women. Further, we explored clinical and histopathological aspects in relation to HPV status and investigated whether HPV status was associated with survival. All vulvar squamous cell carcinoma cases from 1970-1975 and 2000-2005 were extracted from the Cancer Registry of Norway and corresponding tissue blocks were retrieved. After detailed histology review, HPV testing was conducted using real-time TaqMan PCR. Overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed to estimate hazard ratios adjusted for age at diagnosis, stage and diagnostic period. Histological review was performed on 352 vulvar squamous cell carcinoma cases. We were able to obtain valid HPV analysis results for 282 cases, Overall, 29.8% (95% CI 24.5%-35.5%) of cases were high-risk HPV (hrHPV)-positive. When comparing the two periods, we found that the percentage of hrHPV-positive tumors increased significantly from 23% (95% CI 16.0%-31.4%) in 1970-1975 to 35.3% (95% CI 27.8%-43.3%) in 2000-2005 (P\u2009=\u20090.025). The predominant genotypes were HPV 16 (73%), HPV 33 (21%), and HPV 18 (6%), with similar distributions in both periods. In the more recent cohort, several additional genotypes were detected: HPV 6, 11, 39, 45, 52, 58 and 66 were found in smaller percentages, ranging from 1.8% to 3.6%. In univariate analysis, patients with HPV-positive tumors showed improved overall survival compared with patients with HPV-negative tumors (hazard ratio [HR]\u20090.65, 95% CI 0.48-0.86). The prevalence of HPV in vulvar squamous cell carcinomas in Norway was significantly higher in 2000-2005 than in 1970-1975. The three predominant genotypes were HPV 16, 33 and 18 in both time periods. However, several other HPV genotypes have emerged over the last decades. HPV-positivity was associated with better overall survival.",

        "AbstractText": "G-quadruplexes (G4s) are non-canonical four-stranded structures and are emerging as novel genetic regulatory elements. However, a comprehensive genomic annotation of endogenous G4s (eG4s) and systematic characterization of their regulatory network are still lacking, posing major challenges for eG4 research. Here, we present EndoQuad (https://EndoQuad.chenzxlab.cn/) to address these pressing issues by integrating high-throughput experimental data. First, based on high-quality genome-wide eG4s mapping datasets (human: 1181; mouse: 24; chicken: 2) generated by G4 ChIP-seq/CUT&Tag, we generate a reference set of genome-wide eG4s. Our multi-omics analyses show that most eG4s are identified in one or a few cell types. The eG4s with higher occurrences across samples are more structurally stable, evolutionarily conserved, enriched in promoter regions, mark highly expressed genes and associate with complex regulatory programs, demonstrating higher confidence level for further experiments. Finally, we integrate millions of functional genomic variants and prioritize eG4s with regulatory functions in disease and cancer contexts. These efforts have culminated in the comprehensive and interactive database of experimentally validated DNA eG4s. As such, EndoQuad enables users to easily access, download and repurpose these data for their own research. EndoQuad will become a one-stop resource for eG4 research and lay the foundation for future functional studies.",

        "AbstractText": "To explore the current situation, influencing factors and pathways of safety behaviour of nurses in tumour specialized hospitals, in order to provide a theoretical basis for managers to manage and train nurses, improve their safety behaviour level and ensure medical safety. An anonymous cross-sectional survey. A total of 2147 nurses from Grade A cancer hospitals in 15 provinces of China were selected by a convenient sampling method. Questionnaires were collected through the Questionnaire Star platform. Nurses' safety behaviour was measured using the nurse Safety Behaviour Scale, Self-efficacy by the General Self-efficacy Scale, and nurses' occupational burnout was measured by the occupational Burnout Scale, and work engagement through the the Work Engagement Scale. Structural equation modelling was used to test the relationship among nurses' safety behaviour, general self-efficacy, occupational burnout and work engagement. SPSS25.0 software was used to test the relationship among the safety behaviour of nurses, general self-efficacy, occupational burnout and work engagement. The total score of safety behaviour of nurses was 55.45\u2009\u00b1\u20096.879, the total score of general self-efficacy was 31.39\u2009\u00b1\u20095.729, the total score of occupational burnout was 44.99\u2009\u00b1\u200926.587, and the total score of work engagement was 38.48\u2009\u00b1\u200913.433; the scores of the Nurse Safety Behaviour Scale, Self-Efficacy Scale, and Work Engagement Scale were positively correlated (all p\u2009<\u2009.001); the occupational burnout scale was negatively correlated with the scores of self-efficacy scale, work engagement scale and nurse safety behaviour scale (all p\u2009<\u2009.001); Structural equation model analysis shows that self-efficacy and work engagement have a direct positive impact on nurse safety behaviour(\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.103, \u03b2\u2009=\u2009.096, all p\u2009<\u2009.001); Occupational burnout has a direct negative impact on self-efficacy, work engagement and nurse safety behaviour(\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-.371, \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-.413, \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-.328 all p\u2009<\u2009.001). Bootstrap analysis showed that occupational burnout and job involvement had a significant chain mediating effect between self-efficacy and the safety behaviour of nurses (95% CI: 0.148-0.21). The total effect of self-efficacy on the safety behaviour of nurses was 0.283 (p\u2009<\u2009.001, 95% CI: 0.225-0.301), the direct effect was 0.096 (p\u2009<\u2009.001, 95% CI: 0.042-0.15), and the indirect effect was 0.179 (p\u2009<\u2009.001, 95% CI: 0.085-0.215), The mediating effect accounted for 63.3% of the total effect size. Occupational burnout and work engagement play a partial mediating role between self-efficacy and nurse safety behaviour. It is necessary to strengthen training on nurse safety culture awareness, improve the nurse self-efficacy and work engagement, reduce nurse occupational burnout, and thereby improve the level of nurses' safety behaviour.",

        "AbstractText": "The definition of oligometastasis is still controversial. Cytoreductive nephrectomy and metastasectomy are important approaches in selected patients with oligometastasis for improving survival. We aimed to present our laparoscopic metastasectomy experience in a rare case of contralateral adrenal metastasis in an oligometastatic kidney tumor. A 52-year-old male patient was admitted to our clinic with the diagnosis of an incidental right renal mass. On contrast-enhanced abdominal CT revealed a mass reaching approximately 8 cm in diameter in the right kidney located in the middle pole. On contrast-enhanced thorax, CT showed a metastatic lesion in the left main bronchus bifurcation. The patient underwent an open radical nephrectomy with the diagnosis of an oligometastatic right renal mass. His pathology was reported as clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The patient was referred to the medical oncology clinic for immunotherapy. The metastatic lesion in the lung completely regressed in the follow-up of the patient who was started on Chek point inhibitors. However, he was referred to our clinic after an incidental metachronous mass was detected in the contralateral left adrenal in FDG PET/CT (SUVmax: 6.7) in 1st year. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was performed to reevaluate and for mass characterization, and a 4 cm mass was observed in the left contralateral adrenal. Laparoscopic metastasectomy was performed for the left adrenal mass. No recurrence or adrenal insufficiency developed in the 6-month follow-up after discharge. Transperitoneal adrenalectomy is a minimally invasive method that can be safely performed in metastatic adrenal masses. Although contralateral adrenal metastasis is rare in ccRCC, it should be kept in mind that adrenal metastasis may develop in the late period in patients with a history of renal cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "Resveratrol, a polyphenolic phytoalexin found in a wide range of plants, including grapes, berries, and peanuts, is an extensively researched phytochemical with unique pharmacological capabilities and amazing potential to affect many targets in various cancers. Resveratrol's anti-cancer activities are due to its targeting of a variety of cellular and molecular mechanisms and crucial processes involved in cancer pathogenesis, such as the promotion of growth arrest, stimulation of apoptosis, suppression of cell proliferation, induction of autophagy, regulating oxidative stress and inflammation, and improving the influence of some of the other chemotherapeutic agents. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that modulate gene expression by degrading mRNA or inhibiting translation. MiRNAs serve critical roles in a wide range of biological activities, and disruption of miRNA expression is strongly linked to cancer progression. Recent research has shown that resveratrol has anti-proliferative and/or pro-apoptotic properties via modulating the miRNA network, which leads to the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, the activation of apoptosis, or the increase of traditional cancer therapy effectiveness. As a result, employing resveratrol to target miRNAs will be a unique and potential anticancer approach. Here, we discuss the main advances in the modulation of miRNA expression by resveratrol, as well as the several miRNAs that may be influenced by resveratrol in different types of cancer and the significance of this natural drug as a promising strategy in cancer treatment.",

The complexity of brain tumors, including their location, infiltrative nature, and intricate tumor microenvironment (TME), contributes to the difficulties in achieving a complete cure. The primary objective of brain cancer therapy is to effectively treat brain tumors and improve the patient's quality of life. Nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as promising tools in this regard. They can be designed to deliver therapeutic drugs to the brain tumor site while also incorporating imaging agents. The NPs with the 10-200 nm range can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB) and facilitate drug bioavailability. NPs can be designed by several methods to improve the pharmaceutical and pharmacological aspects of encapsulated therapeutic agents. NPs can be developed in various dosage forms to suit different administration routes in brain cancer therapy. The unique properties and versatility of NPs make them essential tools in the fight against brain tumors, offering new opportunities to improve patient outcomes and care. Having the ability to target brain tumors directly, overcome the BBB, and minimize systemic side effects makes NPs valuable tools in improving patient outcomes and care. The review highlights the challenges associated with brain tumor treatment and emphasizes the importance of early detection and diagnosis. The use of NPs for drug delivery and imaging in brain tumors is a promising approach to improving patient outcomes and quality of life. The versatility and unique properties of NPs make them valuable tools in the fight against brain tumors, and NPs have the potential to revolutionize healthcare.",

The use of superparamagnetic nanoparticles in breast cancer research and treatment has gained considerable attention in recent years. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) can be used to construct nanocarriers since they possess superior properties such as superparamagnetism, easy surface functionalization to attach ligands, and non-immunogenic. MNPs are superior carriers that are used to target cancer cells without harming the normal cells in the body, which leads to therapeutic efficacy in the body. Along with their established anticancer potential and enhanced drug concentration at endosomal pH, the superparamagnetic property of MNPs was further exploited for their applications in reticuloendothelial uptake, drug delivery, medical imaging, and theranostics applications in breast cancer. Moreover, the clinical translational of MNPs, along with future prospects and key challenges in vivo, have been duly presented in the final review. The scientists preferred the ongoing research in MNPs due to their high biocompatibility and ease of targeting at molecular and cellular levels.

Herein, we aimed to explore mutationrelated predictive biomarkers in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), which could help develop clinical immunotherapy strategies and screen beneficial populations. Co-occurrence and mutually exclusive analysis was conducted on the TCGA-LUSC cohort. Correlations between the gene mutation status and tumor mutation burden (TMB) levels, and neo-antigen levels were analyzed by Wilcoxon test. Kaplan-Meier method was employed to analyze the progression-free survival (PFS) of lung cancer patients with immunotherapy. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to investigate the functional changes affected by TP53mut/TTNmut. The immune cell infiltration landscape in co-mutation subgroups was analyzed using CIBERSORT. 1) TP53, TTN, CSMD3, MUC16, RYR2, LRP1B, USH2A, SYNE1, ZFHX4, FAM135B, KMT2D, and NAV3 were frequently mutated in LUSC patients. 2) TMB levels in highly mutated groups were higher than that in wild type groups. 3) There were higher neoantigen levels in mutation group compared to the wild-type group, and LUSC patients in mutation group had longer PFS. 4) TP53mut/TTNmut co-mutation group exhibited higher TMB levels and better response to immunotherapy. 5) A host of immune-related signaling pathways was inhibited in TP53mut/TTNmut subgroup. 6) There were more T follicular helper cells and NK cells were in TP53mut/TTNmut subgroup than in the WT subgroup.

        "ArticleTitle": "The construction of hierarchical assemblies with in situ generation of chemotherapy drugs to enhance the efficacy of chemodynamic therapy for multi-modal anti-tumor treatments.",
        "AbstractText": "The effectiveness of chemodynamic therapy (CDT) in cancer treatment is limited by insufficient endogenous H2O2 levels in tumor tissue and an increasing ratio of high valence metal ions. To overcome these challenges, a novel nanotherapeutic approach, named GOx-CuCaP-DSF, has been proposed. This approach involves the design of nanotherapeutics that aim to self-supply H2O2 within cancer cells and provide a supplement of low valence metal ions to enhance the performance of CDT. GOx-CuCaP-DSF nanotherapeutics are engineered by incorporating glucose oxidase (GOx) into Ca2+-doped calcium phosphate (CaP) nanoparticles and loading disulfiram (DSF) through surface adsorption. Under the tumor microenvironment, GOx catalyzes the conversion of tumor-overexpressed glucose (Glu) to liberate H2O2. The degradation of CaP further lowers the pH, facilitating the release of Cu2+ ions and DSF. The rapid reaction between Cu2+ and DSF leads to the generation of Cu+, increasing the Cu+/Cu2+ ratio and promoting the Cu+-based Fenton reaction, which enhances the efficiency of CDT. Simultaneously, DSF undergoes conversion to diethyldithiocarbamate acid (ET), forming a copper(II) complex (Cu(II)ET) by strong chelation with Cu ions. This Cu(II)ET complex, a potent chemotherapeutic drug, exhibits a synergistic therapeutic effect in combination with CDT. Moreover, the elevated Cu+ species resulting from DSF reaction promotes the aggregation of toxic mitochondrial proteins, leading to cell cuproptosis. Overall, the strategy of integrating the chemodynamic therapy efficiency of the Fenton reaction with the activation of efficacious cuproptosis using a chemotherapeutic drug presents a promising avenue for enhancing the effectiveness of multi-modal anti-tumor treatments.",

Sinapic acid is a phenolic acid that occurs naturally and is known to exhibit cytotoxic action in a variety of cancer cell types. In the present study, we utilized cell cytotoxicity assays to assess the cytotoxic potential of sinapic acid on various breast cancer subtypes. In addition, we assessed the cell migration rate, cell apoptosis, and cell cycle phases. Moreover, we utilized multiple system biology tools to predict the potential targets, and molecular docking was performed on the hub targets followed by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. Cytotoxicity assay was performed on cell lines MCF7, T47D, MDA-MB-468, and SKBR3 at different time exposures of 24, 48, and 96\u2009h. Our results revealed sinapic acid to be potent on MCF7 and T47D cell lines. The cell cycle analysis and cell apoptotic assays revealed sinapic acid to cause cell death by apoptosis majorly in the G0/G1 phase. Computational biology revealed KIF18B and VKORC1 to possess the highest binding affinity of -6.5 and -7.5\u2009kcal/mol; displayed stable trajectories on MD run. The cytotoxicity of sinapic acid on luminal A cell lines may be due to the modulation of VKORC1 and KIF18B with major cell death in the G0/G1 phase.

The analyses were first obtained from measurements on a pelvic phantom and on 19 patients treated for bone metastasis. The phantom study consisted of applying known offsets and evaluating the ETX level of accuracy, where results were compared with kV-cone beam computed tomography (kV-CBCT). Two groups of patients, 10 spinal and 9 nonspinal SBRT cases, were analyzed to evaluate ETX imaging for different bone localisations. A comparison was made between kV-CBCT and ETX prior to the treatment fractions. During treatments, two other kV-CBCT/ETX image pairs were also acquired and a total of 224 shifts were compared. A second study, using the ETX monitoring module, analyzed the intrafraction motion of 8 other patients. In the phantom study, the root mean square (RMS) of the translational and rotational discrepancies between ETX and kV-CBCT were\u2009<\u20090.6\u2005mm and\u2009<\u20090.4\u00b0, respectively.

In the nonspinal group, three patients (2 scapulas and 1 humerus) did not have consistent shift values with ETX due to a lack of anatomical information. When ETX monitoring was used during irradiation, the setup errors measured were on average less than 1\u2005mm/1\u00b0. The results obtained validated the use of ETX for 6D image guidance during bone SBRT. Real-time tracking of the target position improves the accuracy of the irradiation. This strategy allowed for faster correction of out-of-tolerance positioning errors. The registration of bone lesions with poor anatomical information is a limitation of this 2D-kV imaging system.",

However, this study found that RNF6 has a clear localization in the nucleus of GC, indicating a role other than ubiquitin ligase. Further chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis revealed that RNF6 has DNA binding and transcriptional regulatory effects and is involved in important pathways such as tumor cell cycle and apoptosis. Cyclin A1 (CCNA1) and CREB binding protein (CREBBP) are downstream targets for RNF6 transcription regulation in GC. RNF6 binds to the promoter region of CCNA1/CREBBP and is actively regulating their expression in GC cells. Silencing CCNA1/CREBBP partially reversed the promoting effect of RNF6 overexpression on the biological function of GC cells.

        "AbstractText": "Inconsistent findings have emerged from epidemiological research investigating the association between vitamin B6 and the risk of gastric cancer. To obtain a more precise assessment, we conducted a comprehensive search of published data and performed a meta-analysis. PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched. A total of 12 studies (5 prospective cohort and 7 case-control studies) involving 5,692 cases and 814,157 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that high intake of vitamin B6 may reduce the odds of gastric cancer (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.73-0.95, p\u2009=\u20090.006). However, this association was only observed in the case-control studies (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.51-0.89, p\u2009=\u20090.006) but not in the cohort studies (RR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.94-1.08, p\u2009=\u20090.819). Additionally, the negative association between vitamin B6 intake and gastric cancer risk was found in the United States of America (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.62-0.82, p\u2009=\u200910-4), but not in Europe (OR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.74-1.05, p\u2009=\u20090.169) or the other regions (OR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.66-1.13, p\u2009=\u20090.280). In conclusion, there is not sufficient evidence to assume that vitamin B6 intake is associated with gastric cancer risk, which needs further confirmation.",

        "AbstractText": "Using information and communication technologies to seek, discuss, and share health-related information influences people's trust and knowledge of several health practices. However, we know little about the associations between individuals' information and communication technology use and their perceptions of trust and knowledge of clinical trials. Examining these associations may lead to the identification of target audiences and channels for developing effective educational interventions and campaigns about clinical trials. In this study, we analyzed Health Information National Trends Survey data to document perceptions of clinical trial-related knowledge and trust that were recently added as questions in this annual national survey of US adults. We also examined correlates of these clinical trial perceptions that included sociodemographic factors and individuals' use of information and communication technologies to seek health information, discuss such information with their healthcare providers, and share the information in their network. More than 90% of participants had no or limited perceived knowledge about clinical trials. Knowledge was higher among those who seek or discuss health-related information online. Differences in perceived knowledge and trust emerged for some racial/ethnic subgroups and other demographic factors. Providers were considered the most trusted source of information (73.6%), followed by health organizations (19.4%) and social support (7.1%). Trust in health organizations compared to health providers was higher among those who used online resources to share health information online with others. Trust in social support was significantly higher among those who used information and communication technologies to communicate about health. Based on these findings, we recommend developing online resources about clinical trials to be distributed through social media. These resources should facilitate a dialogue and be targeted to several groups considering their information and communication technologies' use.",

The molecular mechanisms of triterpenes isolated from P. pycnantha leaves were investigated in vitro on HeLa, MCF-7, HT-29, and KMST-6 cells. The compounds activated several markers associated with apoptosis, viz., phosphatidylserine translocation, caspase activation, oxidative stress, and topoisomerase I inhibition. Compounds 1 and 5 were non-selective, whereas compounds 2, 3, and 4 showed potential as cancer-specific agents by selectively inducing apoptosis only on cancer cells. Theoretical studies on the interactions of compound 1 with caspases -3 and -9 and topoisomerase I were carried out through a molecular docking study and illustrated that compound 1 had an equal binding affinity with the caspases and topoisomerase I comparable to that of camptothecin.

The benefits of IRT include the fact that it is noninvasive, quick, dependable, non-contact, capable of creating several recordings in a short period of time, and secure for both patients and medical professionals. We aimed to determine the predictive value of IRT for identifying and evaluating any interventional procedure in patients affected by peripheral artery disease (PAD) of any severity. We searched the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and PubMed on the topic of IRT and PAD until January 20,2023. We excluded gray literature as it is lacking credibility for not undergoing a peer-reviewed process. The search strategy includes the medical topic headings for \"infrared thermal imaging\" and \"peripheral vascular disorders.\" The primary outcome of this systematic review was the variation in tissue perfusion in PAD patients. Each technique's technical characteristics and therapeutic use within PAD must be described in each included study. This systematic review included 2 case reports and 3 observational studies. By comparing the temperatures of PAD patients hands, legs, and feet, IRT might prove to be an unduly valuable tool for treating vascular illnesses, especially in light of the knowledge gained from the temperature distribution maps. This noninvasive method demonstrated encouraging results in the detection of various areas of foot perfusion and the screening of PAD, and it gave good findings in gauging the effects of any type of intervention.",

The study explored the clinical application value of the HBV gene basal core promoter (BCP) region 1762/1764 combined with gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and its isozyme II (GGTII) in PLC. From June 2017 to June 2021, 145 hepatitis B surface antigen-positive and HBV DNA-positive patients were enrolled in the Third People Hospital of Zigong. Of them, 67 were chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 30 were liver cirrhosis patients, and 48 were patients with hepatitis B-associated PLC. The HBV BCP 1762/1764 mutation was detected through the amplification refractory mutation system fluorescence PCR method, and GGTII was detected using the double-antibody sandwich method. The results showed that the serum GGT activity, GGTII level, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity, AST/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio, GGT/ALT ratio, and GGT/AST ratio were significantly different between the PLC and CHB groups. Statistically significant differences in serum GGT activity, AST activity, and GGT/ALT ratio were observed between the PLC and LC groups. The BCP 1762/1764 mutation rate between the PLC and CHB groups was statistically significant. The GGTII level in the early PLC (stage I + II) group and the advanced PLC (stage III + IV) group was higher than that in the N-PLC group. Serum GGT activity in the early PLC and advanced PLC groups was higher than that in the N-PLC group. The area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic curve of GGT and GGTII for diagnosing PLC was 0.775 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.697, 0.854]) and 0.608 (95% CI [0.512, 0.704]), respectively. The area under curve of GGT and GGTII for diagnosing early PLC was 0.732 (95% CI [0.620, 0.845]) and 0.579 (95% CI [0.452, 0.706]), respectively. HBV gene BCP 1762/1764 mutation, GGT, and GGTII may be related to PLC occurrence. The HBV gene BCP region 1762/1764 combined with GGT has certain clinical diagnostic values for PLC and early PLC.

Currently, the treatment of GC still relies on early surgical resection, and comprehensive treatment is needed for patients with metastatic GC. Anikis-related genes (ANRGs) have been shown to affect tumor metastasis. Exploring the role of ANRGs in GC will help us understand the mechanism of tumor metastasis; screening precise targets and selecting appropriate chemotherapeutics will help individualize the treatment of GC patients. In this study, we established a prognostic scoring model based on ANRGs and explored their association with GC patient prognosis, immune microenvironment, chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity, and small molecule compounds. Our findings revealed that a gene signature composed of ANXA5, CCN1, EGF, VTN, and ZBTB7A accurately predicted GC patient prognosis. Patients in the low-risk group had better outcomes, higher macrophage M1 infiltration, and higher tumor mutation burden. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of Ponatinib (ap.24534), Motesanib (amg.706), and Navitoclax (abt.263) were lower in the high-risk group, indicating that patients in the high-risk group were more sensitive to these chemotherapy drugs, meaning with better clinical outcomes. In addition, we screened the small molecule compound SGC-CBP30 that can inhibit ANXA5 and CCN1, and these results help individualized treatment of GC patients. Our study identified key genes based on ANRGs and developed a novel gene signature for predicting the prognosis of GC patients and understanding the relationship between immunity and tumor mutation burden. Additionally, we identified chemotherapeutic drugs that can guide GC treatment and elucidated the binding affinity between specific targeted drugs and distinct protein sites, providing novel insights for the precise treatment of GC patients.",

PCBP1-AS1 is a valuable tumor-associated LncRNA that plays different biological roles in different cancers. Overall, it can both promote and inhibit the development of cancer. For example, abnormally high expression in castration-resitant prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical cancer, glioma, and colorectal cancer promotes the proliferation and progression of these cancers; in contrast, PCBP1-AS1 inhibits cancer proliferation, metastasis, invasion, and recurrence when highly expressed in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and lung adenocarcinoma.

However, the role of kinesin family member C2 (KIFC2) in tumors, particularly its prognostic value in COAD, remains poorly understood. Our bioinformatics analysis of the cancer genome atlas and GEO databases revealed significantly higher expression of KIFC2 in COAD, correlating with a worse prognosis in the cancer genome atlas-COAD and GSE17536 cohorts. Additionally, differentially expressed genes in COAD were enriched in immune-related pathways, and patients with higher KIFC2 expression showed fewer activated CD4 + T cells. These findings suggest KIFC2 as a potential prognostic biomarker for COAD, warranting further validation in clinical studies.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Identification of immune-related hub genes contributing to the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and remission of ulcerative colitis by integrated bioinformatic analyses.",
        "AbstractText": "The inflammatory disease ulcerative colitis (UC) is multifaceted, immune-mediated, chronic, and relapsing, which is considered to be mainly driven by dysregulated mucosal immune response. The remission of the inflammatory response is a marker of mucosal healing, relating to the low risk of hospitalizations, colorectal cancer, and colectomy. In spite of this, it is still unclear what the key immunological mechanism is which contributes to UC. Here, we explored the immune mechanism and related key genes underlying the state of inflammation in UC. Co-expression networks were constructed based on the expression profiles of immune-related genes in GSE179285. Using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis and Protein-protein interactions analysis, common hub genes were identified in the module of interest. Then, screening of real hub genes, significantly differentially expressing in inflamed UC, was carried out by Differential Expression Genes Analysis of GSE75214, GSE53306, and GSE6731datasets and immunohistochemistry of clinical samples. The diagnosis Capacity of the hub gene was identified by \"glm\" function in R. The potential key immune-related mechanisms were investigated using functional enrichment analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Bioinformatics tools were used to predict potential upstream transcription factors (TF), including the UCSC genome browser, correlation analyses, and JASPAR browser. The analysis revealed the blue module, consisting of 227 immune-related genes, showed the highest correlation with inflamed UC. And then, forty-three common candidates were distinguished. S100A9 was identified within the key module as a real hub gene with good diagnostic performance. The immune genes in the blue module were markedly enriched in the Cytokine-Cytokine receptor interaction. S100A9 most likely gets involved NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathway. SPI1 showed the strongest likelihood to be the regulator. S100A9 was identified as the real immune-related hub gene for inflamed UC. Both diagnosis and remission may be aided by its high expression in the inflamed UC.",

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer (BRCA) is a common malignancy worldwide that is associated with a high mortality rate. Despite recent improvements in diagnosis and treatment, there is an urgent need to investigate the processes underlying cancer progression and identify novel prognostic indicators. Anoikis, which plays a role in the development of human malignant tumors, has been gaining increasing interest from researchers. However, the potential role of anoikis-related genes (ANRGs) in the advancement of BRCA remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to assess the predictive value of ANRGs in BRCA, construct a prognostic model based on ANRGs, and explore the tumor microenvironment in different prognostic score groups. This study utilized data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases to collect clinical information and RNA sequencing data from patients with BRCA. Information on ANRGs was gathered from GeneCards and Harmonizome portals. A risk score model based on ANRGs was created using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox (LASSO) regression analysis. Additionally, the study explored the tumor microenvironment and enriched pathways in different risk groups. Finally, a novel ANRG-based nomogram is developed. A total of 142 differentially expressed genes associated with survival were identified, of which 5 genes were selected to create the ANRG signature. The risk score based on this signature proved to be an independent prognostic factor. Further analysis revealed that different risk subgroups exhibited variations in the tumor microenvironment and drug sensitivities. Subsequently, a nomogram was developed using risk scores and clinicopathological factors. The decision curve analysis results suggest that patients with BRCA might derive clinical treatment benefits from utilizing this prognostic model. Based on the results of this study, the ANRG signature and nomograph established can be used for clinical decision-making in patients with BRCA.",

However, role of DS-cell cycle-dependent protein 1 (DSCC1) and GINS1 in gastric carcinoma remains unclear. The gastric carcinoma datasets GSE79973 and GSE118916 were downloaded from gene expression omnibus. Multiple datasets were merged and batched. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened and weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed. Functional enrichment analysis, gene set enrichment analysis and immune infiltration analysis were performed. Construction and analysis of protein-protein interaction Network. Survival analysis and comparative toxicogenomics database were performed. A heat map of gene expression was drawn. Target Scan screen miRNAs regulating DEGs. Two thousand forty-four DEGs were identified. According to gene ontology analysis, in biological process, they were mainly enriched in cell migration, transforming growth factor \u03b2 receptor signaling pathway, angiogenesis, and steroid metabolism process. In cellular component, they were mainly enriched in extracellular vesicles, basement membrane, endoplasmic reticulum lumen, and extracellular space. In molecular function, they focused on extracellular matrix structural components, protein binding, platelet-derived growth factor binding, and catalytic activity. In Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes, they were mainly enriched in protein digestion and absorption, metabolic pathways, fatty acid degradation, Glycerophospholipid metabolism, ether lipid metabolism. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were mainly enriched in transforming growth factor \u03b2 receptor signaling pathway, steroid metabolism process, basement membrane, endoplasmic reticulum lumen, structural components of extracellular matrix, platelet-derived growth factor binding, Glycerophospholipid metabolism, ether lipid metabolism. The results of immune infiltration analysis showed that expression of T cell CD4 memory resting was lower in the samples of gastric cancer. The core genes (TRIP13, CHEK1, DSCC1, GINS1) are protective factors, their expression shows a downward trend with increase of risk score. Comparative toxicogenomics database analysis showed that TRIP13, CHEK1, DSCC1, GINS1 were related to gastric tumors, gastric diseases, tumors, inflammation, and necrosis. DSCC1 and GINS1 are highly expressed in gastric cancer. Higher expression levels of DSCC1 and GINS1, worse the prognosis.",

This study aimed to evaluate the utility of the systemic immune inflammatory index (SII), a novel index that more accurately depicts inflammatory and immunological balance, in distinguishing between XGC and GBC. This retrospective study included 33 XGC, 22 GBC patients diagnosed according to histopathological findings and 33 age-sex-matched healthy controls at Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, General Surgery Department. The demographic, clinical and laboratory findings were recorded. Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, platelet to lymphocyte ratio, monocyte to lymphocyte ratio and SII were calculated from preoperative complete blood count parameters. The receiver operating characteristic curve was performed to evaluate the utility of SII in differentiating GBC and XGC. A P value\u2005<\u2005.05 was accepted as statistically significant. The preoperative neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, monocyte to lymphocyte ratio, platelet to lymphocyte ratio and SII were significantly higher in patients with GBC compared to XGC patients and healthy controls (P\u2005<\u2005.001, P\u2005=\u2005.001, P\u2005=\u2005.001, P\u2005<\u2005.001, respectively). When receiver operating characteristic analysis was made, the optimal cutoff value of SII was 640 for differential diagnosis of XGC and GBC preoperatively with a sensitivity of 77.3% and a specificity of 66.7%, among which the positive likelihood ratio was 2.32, and Youden index was 0.44 (P\u2005=\u2005.006). The positive predictive value was 60.7%, the negative predictive value was 81.5%, and the diagnostic accuracy was 79.9%. SII may be a valuable, practical, and affordable method to differentiate between XGC and GBC, in addition to clinical and radiological signs, prior to surgery. When supported by prospective trials with a larger study population, distinguishing GBC from XGC using SII preoperatively may lead to a change in the management practice of GBC.",

Most cases of colonic MALT lymphoma are diagnosed at an early stage. Therefore, the clinical features of advanced-stage colonic MALT lymphoma have seldom been reported, and the endoscopic findings are not well established. In this study, we report the clinical and endoscopic characteristics of stage IV colonic MALT lymphoma and highlight the importance of repeat biopsy to figure out this rare disease. The patient was a 68-year-old male complaining of hematochezia and lower left quadrant abdominal pain for the past 3 days. The patient had 3 masses and friable mucosal lesions in the colon. With the first colonoscopy and biopsy, he was initially diagnosed as having eosinophilic colitis. However, the first treatment with steroids did not show any response. Because of atypical clinical features and colonoscopic findings, a second colonoscopy and a repeat biopsy were performed, and the results were consistent with colonic MALT lymphoma arising in the colon. The patient was finally diagnosed with stage IV colonic MALT lymphoma accompanied by multiple distant metastases. The patient started to receive chemotherapy with a combination regimen of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone. The follow-up study after 3 months showed stable disease status based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors. This case report presents atypical clinical characteristics and colonoscopic findings of stage IV colonic MALT lymphoma.

Primary mesenteric abscesses are extremely rare. If not diagnosed and treated in a timely manner, it may lead to serious consequences; computerized tomography is highly beneficial for the diagnosis of this disease; timely surgical intervention, judicious use of antibiotics, and adequate nutritional support are crucial in the management of this disease. A 59-year-old male patient from China was admitted to hospital for intermittent abdominal pain accompanied by poor appetite for 10 days. One week before admission, the patient had been infected with corona virus disease 2019. Past history includes type 2 diabetes and post-operative gastric cancer. The emergency abdominal computerized tomography examination results of the patient suggested that the mesentery was cloudy with a large amount of effusion and visible bubble. Mesentery abscess was considered, but duodenal perforation could not be excluded. We adopted exploratory laparotomy to further clarify the diagnosis. Intraoperatically, after fully exposing the duodenum, we found extensive abscess formation in the mesentery, but no duodenal perforation. After operation, the patient developed duodenal leakage and was treated with gastric tube and jejunal nutrition tube. Postoperatively, due to poor general condition, the patient was transferred to intensive care unit; after anti-infective treatment, the condition improved on the 5th postoperative day, and duodenal leakage appeared on the 9th postoperative day, and conservative treatment was ineffective, and the patient eventually died. Primary mesenteric abscess is a local tissue infectious disease. Whereas we should consider the physical basic condition of the patient during therapeutic process. We believe adequate postoperative drainage, rational use of antibiotics based on bacterial culture, early ambulation after surgery, and adequate nutritional support might be key points for successful therapy.",

In this study, we retrospectively evaluated 853 patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer and followed up at our hospital between 2017 and 2022. The probability of metastasis in the most common tumor group, the non-special type of invasive carcinoma was significantly higher than that in other tumor groups. We formed our groups according to estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and Ki67 status. In addition, when we compared the receptor groups, no significant difference was found between the receptor groups (Table 1). When the entire breast cancer cohort was considered, the association of serosal metastasis was statistically significantly higher in the ER and/or PR (+) and, HER2 (-) receptor subgroup than in all other receptor groups (P < .006), and the association of visceral metastasis/visceral + serosal metastasis with the ER and/or PR (+) and, HER2 (-) receptor subgroup was significantly higher than that in all other receptor groups (P < .001) (Table 2).

        "AbstractText": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterised by a heterogeneous clinical course. Patients can often receive sequential treatments, yet these typically yield diminishing periods of disease control, raising questions about optimal therapy sequencing. Novel agents, such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies and bispecific antibodies, show promise in relapsed MCL, but are often reserved for later treatment lines, which may underserve patients with aggressive disease phenotypes who die early in the treatment journey. To assess the problem of patient attrition from lymphoma-related death limiting sequential treatment, we performed a multicentre retrospective cohort analysis of 389 patients treated at Australian and UK centres over a 10-year period. Deaths from MCL increased after each treatment line, with 7%, 23% and 26% of patients dying from uncontrolled MCL after first, second and third lines respectively. Patients with older age at diagnosis and early relapse after induction therapy were at particular risk of death after second-line treatment. This limitation of sequential treatment by lymphoma-related death provides support for the trial of novel therapies in earlier treatment lines, particularly in high-risk patient populations.",

Traditionally, bone marrow cellularity is estimated semiquantitatively through microscopic examination of core biopsy specimens harvested from the iliac crest of the pelvic bone. Bone marrow cellularity is then designated as hypercellular, normocellular, or hypocellular based on the patient's age. This assessment can have significant clinical impact, but the variation in the age-adjusted normocellularity range is not sufficiently characterized because of a lack of study data, especially in older patients (those older than 70 years of age). This study further established the normal range of bone marrow cellularity, particularly in older adults. In this study, 570 benign staging and healthy donor bone marrows from patients 1 year to 93 years of age were analyzed for cellularity. Linear regression modeling demonstrates that cellularity in adults declines approximately 3% per decade, including after the seventh decade of life. The 90% reference interval for normocellularity in United States is 30% to 75% for those aged 18 to 90 years. The findings revealed a more stable and slower rate of decline in cellularity with age in adults than the widely used linear model of \"100% minus the patient age in decades.\" Normocellularity is better modeled based on age group. In those younger than 20 years of age, normocellularity ranges from 45% to 85% (mean [SD], 65% [20%]), as defined by Friebert et al in 1998. Based on our study finding of a little less than 3% decline per decade of age, the following is our recommendation for normocellularity range: For individuals 20 to 40 years of age, it ranges from 40% to 70% (mean [SD], 55% [15%]); for individuals 40 to 60 years of age, it ranges from 35% to 65% (mean [SD], 50% [15%]); and for individuals older than 60 years of age, it ranges from 30% to 60% (mean [SD], 45% [15%]).

Glymphatic flow in the whole brain and the olfactory bulb was analyzed using model-derived parameters of arrival time, infusion rate, clearance rate, and residual that describe the dynamics of CSF tracer over time. 3D dynamic T1WI data identified reduced glymphatic influx and clearance, indicating an impaired glymphatic system due to GBM. Kinetic modeling and quantitative analyses consistently indicated significantly reduced infusion rate, clearance rate, and increased residual of CSF tracer in GBM rats compared to control rats, suggesting restricted glymphatic flow in the brain with GBM. In addition, our results identified compromised perineural pathway along the optic nerves in GBM rats. Our study demonstrates the presence of GBM-impaired glymphatic response in the rat brain and impaired perineural pathway along the optic nerves. Reduced glymphatic waste clearance may lead to the accumulation of toxic waste solutes and pro-inflammatory signaling molecules which may affect the progression of the GBM.",

        "AbstractText": "Chronic non-healing wounds pose a global health challenge. Under optimized conditions, skin wounds heal by the formation of scar tissue. However, deregulated cell activation leads to persistent inflammation and the formation of granulation tissue, a type of premature scar tissue without epithelialization. Regenerative cells from the wound periphery contribute to the healing process, but little is known about their cellular fate in an inflammatory, macrophage-dominated wound microenvironment. We examined CD45-/CD31-/CD34+ preadipocytes and CD68+ macrophages in human granulation tissue from pressure ulcers (n=6) using immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry. In vitro, we studied macrophage-preadipocyte interactions using primary human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) exposed to conditioned medium harvested from IFNG/LPS (M1)- or IL4/IL13 (M2)-activated macrophages. Macrophages were derived from THP1 cells or CD14+ monocytes. In addition to confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, ASCs were analyzed for metabolic (OXPHOS, glycolysis), morphological (cytoskeleton), and mitochondrial (ATP production, membrane potential) changes. Angiogenic properties of ASCs were determined by HUVEC-based angiogenesis assay. Protein and mRNA levels were assessed by immunoblotting and quantitative RT-PCR. CD45-/CD31-/CD34+ preadipocytes were observed with a prevalence of up to 1.5% of total viable cells in human granulation tissue. Immunofluorescence staining suggested a spatial proximity of these cells to CD68+ macrophages in vivo. In vitro, ASCs exposed to M1, but not to M2 macrophage secretome showed a pro-fibrotic response characterized by stress fiber formation, elevated alpha smooth muscle actin (SMA), and increased expression of integrins ITGA5 and ITGAV. Macrophage-secreted IL1B and TGFB1 mediated this response via the PI3K/AKT and p38-MAPK pathways. In addition, ASCs exposed to M1-inflammatory stress demonstrated reduced migration, switched to a glycolysis-dominated metabolism with reduced ATP production, and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL1B, IL8, and MCP1. Notably, M1 but not M2 macrophages enhanced the angiogenic potential of ASCs. Preadipocyte fate in wound tissue is influenced by macrophage polarization. Pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages induce a pro-fibrotic response in ASCs through IL1B and TGFB1 signaling, while anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages have limited effects. These findings shed light on cellular interactions in chronic wounds and provide important information for the potential therapeutic use of ASCs in human wound healing.",

        "AbstractText": "Mammary physiology is distinguished in containing adult stem/progenitor cells that are actively amending the breast tissue throughout the reproductive lifespan of women. Despite their importance in both mammary gland development, physiological maintenance, and reproduction, the exact role of mammary stem/progenitor cells in mammary tumorigenesis has not been fully elucidated in humans or animal models. The implications of modulating adult stem/progenitor cells in women could lead to a better understanding of not only their function, but also toward possible breast cancer prevention led us to evaluate the efficacy of rapamycin in reducing mammary stem/progenitor cell activity and malignant progression markers. We analyzed a large number of human breast tissues for their basal and luminal cell composition with flow cytometry and their stem and progenitor cell function with sphere formation assay with respect to age and menopausal status in connection with a clinical study (NCT02642094) involving a low-dose (2\u00a0mg/day) and short-term (5-7\u00a0days) treatment of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus. The expression of biomarkers in biopsies and surgical breast samples were measured with quantitative analysis of immunohistochemistry. Sirolimus treatment significantly abrogated mammary stem cell activity, particularly in postmenopausal patients. It did not affect the frequency of luminal progenitors but decreased their self-renewal capacity. While sirolimus had no effect on basal cell population, it decreased luminal cell population, particularly in postmenopausal patients. It also significantly diminished prognostic biomarkers associated with breast cancer progression from ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive breast cancer including p16INK4A, COX-2, and Ki67, as well as markers of the senescence-associated secretary phenotype, thereby possibly functioning in preventing early breast cancer progression. Overall, these findings indicate a link from mTOR signaling to mammary stem and progenitor cell activity and cancer progression.

        "AbstractText": "The novel concept of microwave dynamic therapy (MDT) solves the problem of incomplete tumor eradication caused by non-selective heating and uneven temperature distribution of microwave thermal therapy (MWTT) in clinic, but the poor delivery of microwave sensitizer and the obstacle of tumor hypoxic microenvironment limit the effectiveness of MDT. Herein, we engineer a liquid metal-based nanozyme LM@ZIF@HA (LZH) with eutectic Gallium Indium (EGaIn) as the core, which is coated with CoNi-bimetallic zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF) and hyaluronic acid (HA). The flexibility of the liquid metal and the targeting of HA enable the nanozyme to be effectively endocytosed by tumor cells, solving the problem of poor delivery of microwave sensitizers. Due to the catalase-like activity, the nanozyme catalyze excess H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment to generate O2, alleviating the restriction of the tumor hypoxic microenvironment and promoting the production of ROS under microwave irradiation. In vitro cell experiments, the nanozyme has remarkable targeting effect, oxygen production capacity, and microwave dynamic effect, which effectively solves the defects of MDT. In the constructed patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, the nanozyme achieves excellent MDT effect, despite the heterogeneity and complexity of the tumor model that is similar to the histological and pathological features of the patient. The tumor volume in the LZH\u2009+\u2009MW group is only about 1/20 of that in the control group, and the tumor inhibition rate is as high as 95%. The synthesized nanozyme effectively solves the defects of MDT, improves the targeted delivery of microwave sensitizers while regulating the hypoxic microenvironment of tumors, and achieves excellent MDT effect in the constructed PDX model, providing a new strategy for clinical cancer treatment.",

No targeted therapies are reported as efficient until now. The extracellular matrix, in particular the fibronectin type I motif IGDQ, plays a major role in regulating cell migration prior metastasis formation. This motif interacts with specific integrins inducing their activation and the migratory signal transduction.Here, we characterized the migratory phenotype of MDA-MB-231 cells, using functionalized IGDQ-exposing surfaces, and compared it to integrin A5 and integrin B3 knock-down cells. A multiomic analysis was developed that highlighted the splicing factor SRSF6 as a putative master regulator of cell migration and of integrin intracellular trafficking. Indacaterol-induced inhibition of SRSF6 provoked: i) the inhibition of collective and IGDQ-mediated cell migration and ii) ITGA5 sequestration into endosomes and lysosomes. Upon further studies, indacaterol may be a potential therapy to prevent cell migration and reduce metastasis formation in breast cancer. Video Abstract.",

Data-Independent Acquisition was used to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analysis and machine learning algorithms (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression) were used to identify candidate genes for diagnosing CRC with S. japonicum infection. To assess the diagnostic value, the nomogram and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were developed. A total of 115 DEPs were screened, the DEPs that were discovered were mostly related with biological process in generation of precursor metabolites and energy,energy derivation by oxidation of organic compounds, carboxylic acid metabolic process, oxoacid metabolic process, cellular respiration aerobic respiration according to the analyses. Enrichment analysis showed that these compounds might regulate oxidoreductase activity, transporter activity, transmembrane transporter activity, ion transmembrane transporter activity and inorganic molecular entity transmembrane transporter activity. Following the development of PPI network and LASSO, 13 genes (hsd17b4, h2ac4, hla-c, pc, epx, rpia, tor1aip1, mindy1, dpysl5, nucks1, cnot2, ndufa13 and dnm3) were filtered, and 3 candidate hub genes were chosen for nomogram building and diagnostic value evaluation after machine learning.

LncRNA ASBEL has been identified as oncogene and an anti-sense transcript of tumor-suppressor gene of BTG3 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Herein, multicomponent self-assembled polyelectrolyte nanocomplexes (CANPs) based on the polyelectrolytes of bioactive hyaluronic acid (HA) and chitosan hydrochloride (CS) were designed and prepared for the collaborative modulation of oncogenic lncRNA ASBEL with antago3, an oligonucleotide antagonist targeting lncRNA ASBEL and hydrophobic curcumin (Cur) co-delivery for synergetic TNBC therapy. Antago3 and Cur co-incorporated CANPs were achieved via a one-step assembling strategy with the cooperation of noncovalent electrostatic interactions, hydrogen-bonding, and hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, the multicomponent assembled CANPs were ulteriorly decorated with a near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) Cy-5.5 dye (FCANPs) for synchronous NIRF imaging and therapy monitoring performance. Resultantly, MDA-MB-231 cells proliferation, migration, and invasion were efficiently inhibited, and the highest apoptosis ratio was induced by FCANPs with coordination patterns. At the molecular level, effective regulation of lncRNA ASBEL/BTG3 and synchronous regulation of Bcl-2 and c-Met pathways could be observed. As expected, systemic administration of FCANPs resulted in targeted and preferential accumulation of near-infrared fluorescence signal and Cur in the tumor tissue. More attractively, systemic FCANPs-mediated collaborative modulating lncRNA ASBEL/BTG3 and Cur co-delivery significantly suppressed the MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor growth, inhibited metastasis and extended survival rate with negligible systemic toxicity.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are novel diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for\u00a0cancers. The miRNA miR-3195 is aberrantly expressed in multiple types of tumors. However, the expression levels and biological functions of miR-3195 in OS remain unclear. Two Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets (GSE69470 and GSE16088) were used to analyze differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs in osteosarcoma cell lines and OS tissues. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the expression levels of miR-3195 and the SRY-box transcription factor 4 (SOX4) mRNA in OS tissues\u00a0and\u00a0cell lines. The relationship between miR-3195 and the 3'-upstream region (3'-UTR) in the SOX4 mRNA (predicted through bioinformatics) was analyzed using Pearson's correlation analysis and confirmed by a dual-luciferase reporter gene experiment.\u00a0Cell counting kit-8 assays, colony formation assays, flow cytometry, wound healing assays, transwell assays, and western blotting were performed to explore the effects of miR-3195 levels on SOX4 affected OS cell biological behavior. Our results revealed that miR-3195 was the most down-regulated miRNA and SOX4 was the most up-regulated mRNA by Bioinformatic analysis. It was further confirmed miR-3195 had low expression, and SOX4 had high expression levels in clinical OS tissue samples; the expression levels of both genes were negatively correlated with each other in OS tissues.

Cytokines play key roles in immunodeficiencies, autoimmune diseases, allergies, and cancer. Although \u03b3c is considered an assistant receptor to transmit cytokine signals and is an indispensable receptor in the immune system, its regulatory mechanism is not yet well understood. This study focused on the molecular mechanisms that \u03b3c expression in T cells is regulated under T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. The \u03b3c expression in TCR-stimulated T cells was determined by flow cytometry, western blot and quantitative RT-PCR. The regulatory mechanism of \u03b3c expression in activated T cells was examined by promoter-luciferase assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. NFAT1 and NF\u03baB deficient cells generated using CRISPR-Cas9 and specific inhibitors were used to examine their role in regulation of \u03b3c expression. Specific binding motif was confirmed by \u03b3c promotor mutant cells generated using CRISPR-Cas9. IL-7Tg\u03b3cTg mice were used to examine regulatory role of \u03b3c in cytokine signaling. We found that activated T cells significantly upregulated \u03b3c expression, wherein NFAT1 and NF\u03baB were key in transcriptional upregulation via T cell receptor stimulation. Also, we identified the functional binding site of the \u03b3c promoter and the synergistic effect of NFAT1 and NF\u03baB in the regulation of \u03b3c expression. Increased \u03b3c expression inhibited IL-7 signaling and rescued lymphoproliferative disorder in an IL-7Tg animal model, providing novel insights into T cell homeostasis. Our results indicate functional cooperation between NFAT1 and NF\u03baB in upregulating \u03b3c expression in activated T cells. As \u03b3c expression also regulates \u03b3c cytokine responsiveness, our study suggests that \u03b3c expression should be considered as one of the regulators in \u03b3c cytokine signaling and the development of T cell immunotherapies.

Thus, identifying efficient prognostic factors and understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms in GC are essential for improving patient outcomes. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of RECK (reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs) in the prognostic significance and molecular mechanisms of its biological function in GC. Multiple bioinformatics strategies were performed to detect the potential functions and prognostic efficiency of RECK in GC. Rescue experiments revealed that the molecular mechanism by which RECK in inhibited tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion was mediated by ERK/MAPK signaling in AGS and HGC-27 cells. Using integrated bioinformatics analysis and western blot assay, we investigated the potential interaction between CALD1 and RECK. Our findings revealed significantly decreased RECK expression in GC samples compared to normal samples and RECK was identified as a promising predictor for the prognosis of GC patients. Moreover, upregulation of RECK demonstrated a distinctly positive association with a high-immunity and low-metastasis microenvironment in GC. Mechanistically, the antitumour effects of RECK on hampering tumor cell growth, migration, and invasion were mediated by the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway. In addition, we also illustrated that RECK inhibited the phosphorylation of CALD1 mediated by decreased phosphorylation of ERK. RECK is a promising prognostic biomarker and may shape a high-tumor-immunity and low-metastasis microenvironment in patients with GC. Moreover, RECK exerted its tumor-suppressive effects by the inactivation of ERK/MAPK signaling in GC cells.",

To ensure functional adaption, bladder cells rely on high biomechanical compliance, nevertheless aging or chronic pathological conditions can modify this plasticity. Obviously the cytoskeletal network plays an essential role, however the contribution of other, closely entangled, intracellular organelles is currently underappreciated. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lies at a crucial crossroads, connected to both nucleus and cytoskeleton. Yet, its role in the maintenance of cell mechanical stability is less investigated. To start exploring these aspects, T24 bladder cancer cells were treated with the ER stress inducers brefeldin A (10-40nM BFA, 24\u00a0h) and thapsigargin (0.1-100nM TG, 24\u00a0h). Without impairment of cell motility and viability, BFA and TG triggered a significant subcellular redistribution of the ER; this was associated with a rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton. Additional inhibition of actin polymerization with cytochalasin D (100nM CytD) contributed to the spread of the ER toward cell periphery, and was accompanied by an increase of cellular stiffness (Young\u00b4s modulus) in the cytoplasmic compartment. Shrinking of the ER toward the nucleus (100nM TG, 2\u00a0h) was related to an increased stiffness in the nuclear and perinuclear areas. A similar short-term response profile was observed also in normal human primary bladder fibroblasts. In sum, the ER and its subcellular rearrangement seem to contribute to the mechanical properties of bladder cells opening new perspectives in the study of the related stress signaling cascades.

The present study examined whether prognosis is influenced by pathological prognostic factors using radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens from low-risk patients. We evaluated diagnostic accuracy by examining biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival with respect to clinical and pathological prognostic factors in 419 all-risk patients who underwent RP. Clinical prognostic factors included age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, PSA density, and risk stratification, while pathological prognostic factors included grade group, lymphovascular space invasion, extraprostatic extension, surgical margins, seminal vesicle invasion, intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDCP), and pT. In a subsequent analysis restricted to 104 low-risk patients, survival curves were estimated for pathological prognostic factors using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank and generalized Wilcoxon tests. In the overall risk analysis, the presence of pathological prognostic factors significantly shortened BCR-free survival (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Univariable analysis revealed that PSA density, risk categories, and pathological prognostic factors were significantly associated with BCR-free survival, although age and PSA were not.

Diagnosis, treatment adherence, medication, and vegetative functionality is determined from the medical records of the patients. In the 3rd part of the project, the results of the study will be discussed with patients, relatives, health care professionals and the patient advisory board regarding implementation. This study is the first to investigate whether individualized VR videos have additional benefits over generic VR nature videos on symptom relief, well-being, treatment satisfaction, and adherence in patients with palliative cancer care. A strength of the study is that we can incorporate the results of each part of the project into the subsequent project parts. However, the generalizability might be limited as this is a single-centred study.

        "AbstractText": "This study aimed to evaluate an a-priori multicriteria plan optimization algorithm (mCycle) for locally advanced breast cancer radiation therapy (RT) by comparing automatically generated VMAT (Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy) plans (AP-VMAT) with manual clinical Helical Tomotherapy (HT) plans. The study included 25 patients who received postoperative RT using HT. The patient cohort had diverse target selections, including both left and right breast/chest wall (CW) and III-IV node, with or without internal mammary node (IMN) and Simultaneous Integrated Boost (SIB). The Planning Target Volume (PTV) was obtained by applying a 5\u00a0mm isotropic expansion to the CTV (Clinical Target Volume), with a 5\u00a0mm clip from the skin. Comparisons of dosimetric parameters and delivery/planning times were conducted. Dosimetric verification of the AP-VMAT plans was performed. The study showed statistically significant improvements in AP-VMAT plans compared to HT for OARs (Organs At Risk) mean dose, except for the heart and ipsilateral lung. No significant differences in V95% were observed for PTV breast/CW and PTV III-IV, while increased coverage (higher V95%) was seen for PTV IMN in AP-VMAT plans. HT plans exhibited smaller values of PTV V105% for breast/CW and III-IV, with no differences in PTV IMN and boost. HT had an average (\u00b1\u2009standard deviation) delivery time of (17\u2009\u00b1\u20098) minutes, while AP-VMAT took (3\u2009\u00b1\u20091) minutes. The average \u03b3 passing rate for AP-VMAT plans was 97%\u00b11%. Planning times reduced from an average of 6\u00a0h for HT to about 2\u00a0min for AP-VMAT. Comparing AP-VMAT plans with clinical HT plans showed similar or improved quality. The implementation of mCycle demonstrated successful automation of the planning process for VMAT treatment of locally advanced breast cancer, significantly reducing workload.",

        "AbstractText": "Ras-GTPase-activating protein binding protein 1 (G3BP1) is an oncogenic factor, which highly expressed in a variety of cancers. In recent years, G3BP1 has been reported to promote the development of prostate cancer by inhibiting the degradation of AR through inhibiting SPOP. However, whether G3BP1 contributes in a similar manner to the abnormal accumulation of ER\u03b1, which is also an important target for hormone therapy, remains unknown. This article addresses this issue and explores potential mechanisms. Bioinformatics tools were used for G3BP1 expression analysis, survival analysis, and clinical association analysis. Immunohistochemical staining was used to examine the correlation between G3BP1 and ER\u03b1 in EC patients. In addition, western blot and co-immunoprecipitation were used to detect the half-life of G3BP1 and mutant, and the effect of G3BP1 and mutant on the ubiquitination and degradation of ER\u03b1 mediated by SPOP. Then, the oncogenic functions of G3BP1 dependent on the SPOP/ER\u03b1 axis were determined by CCK8 cell proliferation assay, colony formation assay and cell migration assay. Finally, we established the EC cells treated or untreated with fulvestrant, exploring the possibility of fulvestrant combined with the reduction of G3BP1 to improve the efficacy of fulvestrant. G3BP1 is abnormally high expressed and characterized by high-frequency mutation in EC. In addition, there is a positive correlation between G3BP1 protein and ER\u03b1 protein. Mechanistically, both G3BP1 and mutant, the latter is displaying the longer half-life, competitively bind SPOP with ER\u03b1, thereby inhibiting SPOP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of ER\u03b1. Functionally, G3BP1 and mutant promote the proliferation and migration of EC cells by regulating the G3BP1/SPOP/ER\u03b1 axis. However, fulvestrant can reverse the cancer-promoting effects of G3BP1 and mutant. G3BP1 and its mutant positively regulate ER\u03b1 signaling pathway by inhibiting SPOP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of ER\u03b1, indicating the promising effect of fulvestrant on the suppression the occurrence and development of EC with high expressed G3BP1 and G3BP1 mutants.

        "AbstractText": "Black Americans suffer disparities in risk for cardiometabolic and other chronic diseases. Findings from the Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) cohort have shown associations of plant-based dietary patterns and healthy lifestyle factors with prevention of such diseases. Hence, it is likely that racial differences in metabolic profiles correlating with disparities in chronic diseases are explained largely by diet and lifestyle, besides social determinants of health. Untargeted plasma metabolomics screening was performed on plasma samples from 350 participants of the AHS-2, including 171 Black and 179 White participants, using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and a global platform of 892 metabolites. Differences in metabolites or biochemical subclasses by race were analyzed using linear regression, considering various models adjusted for known confounders, dietary and/or other lifestyle behaviors, social vulnerability, and psychosocial stress. The Storey permutation approach was used to adjust for false discovery at FDR\u2009<\u20090.05. Linear regression revealed differential abundance of over 40% of individual metabolites or biochemical subclasses when comparing Black with White participants after adjustment for false discovery (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05), with the vast majority showing lower abundance in Blacks. Associations were not appreciably altered with adjustment for dietary patterns and socioeconomic or psychosocial stress. Metabolite subclasses showing consistently lower abundance in Black participants included various lipids, such as lysophospholipids, phosphatidylethanolamines, monoacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, and long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids, among other subclasses or lipid categories. Among all biochemical subclasses, creatine metabolism exclusively showed higher abundance in Black participants, although\u00a0among metabolites within this subclass, only creatine showed differential abundance after adjustment for glomerular filtration rate. Notable metabolites in higher abundance in Black participants included methyl and propyl paraben sulfates, piperine metabolites, and a considerable proportion of acetylated amino acids, including many previously found associated with glomerular filtration rate. Differences in metabolic profiles were evident when comparing Black and White participants of the AHS-2 cohort. These differences are likely attributed in part to dietary behaviors not adequately explained by dietary pattern covariates, besides other environmental or genetic factors. Alterations in these metabolites and associated subclasses may have implications for the prevention of chronic diseases in Black Americans.",

        "AbstractText": "Resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is a significant issue in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), as it is in the majority of cancer types. An important deficiency in immunooncology today is the lack of a predictive factor to identify this patient group. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are a type of cell that contributes to immunotherapy resistance by inhibiting T cell activity. While it accumulates in the tumor microenvironment and blood, it can also accumulate in lymphoid organs such as the spleen and cause splenomegaly. Therefore we aimed to evaluate the effect of increase in splenic volume, which can be considered as an indirect indicator of increased MDSC cells, on survival outcomes in mRCC patients. We analyzed 45 patients with mRCC who received nivolumab as a second-line or subsequent therapy. Splenic volume was analyzed from baseline imaging before starting nivolumab and from control imaging performed within the first 6 months of treatment initiation. Additionally, we analyzed how patients' body mass index (BMI), IMDC risk score, ECOG performance status, nephrectomy status, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and sites of metastasis. Median splenic volume change was 10% (ranging from -\u200922% to +\u2009117%) during follow-up. Change in splenic volume was found to be associated with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) (p\u2009=\u20090.025, 0.04). The median PFS in patients with increased splenic volume was 5 months, while it was 17 months in patients without increased splenic volume. (HR 2.1, 95% CI (1-4), p\u2009=\u20090.04). The median OS in patients with increased splenic volume was 9 months, while it was 35 months in patients without increased splenic volume (HR 2.7, 95% CI (1.1-6.2), p\u2009=\u20090.025). In four patients with decreased splenic volume, neither PFS nor OS could reach the median value. Log-rank p value in respectively (0.015, 0.035), The group in which an increase in volume was accompanied by a high NLR had the shortest survival rate. Basal splenic volume was analyzed separately. However, neither PFS nor OS differed significantly. Our findings suggest that the change in splenic volume throughout immunotherapy regimens may be utilized to predict PFS and OS in mRCC patients undergoing treatment.",

We analyzed data from 2914 cancer survivors who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2007-2018) and followed up with them until December 31, 2019. Sedentary behavior was assessed by self-reported daily hours of sitting, and vitamin D status was measured by serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels. Among 2914 cancer survivors, vitamin D deficiency was more prevalent in those with prolonged daily sitting time.

        "AbstractText": "Prostate cancer is currently the second most lethal malignancy in men worldwide due to metastasis and invasion in advanced stages. Studies have revealed that androgen deprivation therapy can induce stable remission in patients with advanced prostate cancer, although most patients will develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in 1-2\u00a0years. Docetaxel and enzalutamide improve survival in patients with CRPC, although only for a short time, eventually patients develop primary or secondary resistance, causing disease progression or biochemical relapse. The gene expression profiles of docetaxel-sensitive or -resistant prostate cancer cell lines, namely GSE33455, GSE36135, GSE78201, GSE104935, and GSE143408, were sequentially analyzed for differentially expressed genes and progress-free interval significance. Subsequently, the overall survival significance and clinic-pathological features were analyzed by the R package. The implications of hub genes mutations, methylation in prostate cancer and the relationship with the tumor immune cell infiltration microenvironment were assessed with the help of cBioPortal, UALCAN and TISIDB web resources. Finally, effects of the hub genes on the progression and drug resistance in prostate cancer were explored using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, cell phenotype, and drug sensitivity. Glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1) was tentatively identified by bioinformatic analysis as an hub gene for the development of drug resistance, including docetaxel and enzalutamide, in prostate cancer. Additionally, GAD1 expression, mutation and methylation were significantly correlated with the clinicopathological features and the tumor immune microenvironment. RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, cell phenotype and drug sensitivity experiments further demonstrated that GAD1 promoted prostate cancer progression and decreased the therapeutic effect of docetaxel or enzalutamide. This research confirmed that GAD1 was a hub gene in the progression and development of drug resistance in prostate cancer. This helped to explain prostate cancer drug resistance and provides new immune-related therapeutic targets and biomarkers for it.",

Herein, we estimated the current (2018) and future (2030) federal direct healthcare costs of colorectal cancer in the Brazilian Unified Health System attributable to red and processed meat consumption. Considering reduced red and processed meat consumption, we also projected attributable costs of colorectal cancer in 2040. We retrieved information on red and processed meat consumption from two nationally representative dietary surveys, the Household Budget Survey 2008-2009 and 2017-2018; relative risks for colorectal cancer from a meta-analysis; direct healthcare costs of inpatient and outpatient procedures in adults\u2009\u2265\u200930\u00a0years with colorectal cancer (C18-C20) from 2008-2019 by sex. Attributable costs of colorectal cancer were calculated via comparative risk assessment, assuming a 10-year lag. In 2018, US$ 20.6 million (8.4%) of direct healthcare costs of colorectal cancer were attributable to red and processed meat consumption. In 2030, attributable costs will increase to US$ 86.6 million (19.3%). Counterfactual scenarios of reducing red and processed meat consumption in 2030 suggested that US$ 2.2 to 11.9 million and US$ 13 to 74 million could be saved in 2040, respectively. Red and processed meat consumption has an escalating economic impact on the Brazilian Unified Health System.

An improved FPN network for brain tumor segmentation is proposed to improve the segmentation effect of brain tumor. Aiming at the problem that the traditional full convolutional neural network (FCN) has weak processing ability, which leads to the loss of details in tumor segmentation, this paper proposes a brain tumor image segmentation method based on the improved feature pyramid networks (FPN) convolutional neural network. In order to improve the segmentation effect of brain tumors, we improved the model, introduced the FPN structure into the U-Net structure, captured the context multi-scale information by using the different scale information in the U-Net model and the multi receptive field high-level features in the FPN convolutional neural network, and improved the adaptability of the model to different scale features. Performance evaluation indicators show that the proposed improved FPN model has 99.1% accuracy, 92% DICE rating and 86% Jaccard index. The performance of the proposed method outperforms other segmentation models in each metric. In addition, the schematic diagram of the segmentation results shows that the segmentation results of our algorithm are closer to the ground truth, showing more brain tumour details, while the segmentation results of other algorithms are smoother. The experimental results show that this method can effectively segment brain tumor regions and has certain generalization, and the segmentation effect is better than other networks.

Pancreatic cancer cells were treated with L. casei & L. reuteri and co-cultured with macrophages in a transwell system in vitro. Pancreatic cancer xenograft model was established and L. casei & L. reuteri was used to treat mice in vivo. MTT, CCK-8 assay or immunohistochemical staining were used to determine the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells or tumor tissues. Transwell assay was applied to test the migration and invasion of pancreatic cells. RT-qPCR was utilized to assess TLR4 and MyD88 expressions in pancreatic cells or tumor tissues. WB, immunofluorescence staining, or flow cytometry was used to evaluate the M1/M2 polarization of macrophages. Besides, the composition of gut microbiota of tumor-bearing mice was determined by 16\u00a0S rRNA sequencing, and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) untargeted metabolomics was used to evaluate the metabolic profiles of feces. L. casei & L. reuteri inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion of pancreatic cancer cells and pancreatic cancer cell-induced M2 polarization of macrophages by suppressing TLR4.

Para-meningeal rhabdomyosarcoma in head and neck (PM-HNRMS) is less applicable for surgery due to the anatomic reason. PM-HNRMS has a poor prognosis in children. However, its clinical outcomes remain unclear in adults due to the rarity. Further, there is almost no detailed data about salvage therapy. We retrospectively examined the adult patients with PM-HNRMS treated at institutions belonging to the Kyushu Medical Oncology Group from 2009 to 2022. We evaluated the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of the patients who received a first-line therapy. We also reviewed the clinical outcomes of patients who progressed against a first-line therapy and received salvage therapy. Total 11 patients of PM-HNRMS received a first-line therapy. The characteristics were as follows: median age: 38\u00a0years (range 25 - 63\u00a0years), histology (alveolar/spindle): 10/1, and risk group (intermediate/high): 7/4. As a first-line therapy, VAC and ARST0431-based regimen was performed in 10 and 1 patients, respectively. During a first-line therapy, definitive radiation for all lesions were performed in seven patients. The median PFS was 14.2\u00a0months (95%CI: 6.0 - 25.8\u00a0months): 17.1\u00a0months (95%CI: 6.0 - not reached (NR)) for patients with stage I-III and 8.5\u00a0months (95%CI: 5.2 - 25.8\u00a0months) for patients with stage IV. The 1-year and 3-year PFS rates were 54.5% and 11.3% for all patients.

The 5-year OS rate was 48.5% for all patients. Among seven patients who received salvage therapy, three are still alive, two of whom remain disease-free for over 4\u00a0years after completion of the last therapy. Those two patients received multi-modal therapy including local therapy for all detected lesions. The cure rate of adult PM-HNRMS is low in spite of a first-line therapy in this study.

        "AbstractText": "Adropin is encoded by the energy homeostasis-associated (ENHO) gene and widely present in liver, pancreas, heart, kidney, brain, and vascular tissues. Abnormal adropin is associated with metabolic, inflammatory, immune, and central nervous disorders. Whether adropin is involved in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) is still unclear. Here, decreased adropin expression of tumor-nest cells in advanced-stage CRC was demonstrated. Adropin expressed by carcinoma cells was negatively correlated with macrophage infiltration in the matrix of CRC tissues. However, tumor macrophages enhanced adropin expression and were positively correlated with tumor invasion and metastasis. ENHO gene transfection into colon cancer (MC38) cells inhibited tumor growth in vivo, accompanying the increase of M1 macrophages. Treatment with low-dose adropin (<\u2009100 ng/mL) on macrophages ex vivo directly increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species for inflammasome activation. Furthermore, ENHO-/- mice had less M1 macrophages in vivo, and ENHO-/- macrophages were inert to be induced into the M1 subset ex vivo. Finally, low-dose adropin promoted glucose utilization, and high-dose adropin enhanced the expression of CPT1\u03b1 in macrophages. Therefore, variations of adropin level in carcinoma cells or macrophages in tumor tissues are differently involved in CRC progression. Low-dose adropin stimulates the antitumor activity of macrophages, but high-dose adropin facilitates the pro-tumor activity of macrophages. Increasing or decreasing the adropin level can inhibit tumor progression at different CRC stages.",

Particularly in cancer research, when reducing the number of features, i.e., genes, it is important to select the most informative features/potential biomarkers that could affect the diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, researchers continuously try to explore more efficient ways to reduce the large number of features/genes to a small but informative subset before the classification task. Hybrid methods have been extensively investigated for this purpose, and research to find the optimal approach is ongoing. Social network analysis is used as a part of a hybrid method, although there are several issues that have arisen when using social network tools, such as using a single environment for computing, constructing an adjacency matrix or computing network measures. Therefore, in our study, we apply a hybrid feature selection method consisting of several machine learning algorithms in addition to social network analysis with our proposed network metric, called the corrected degree of domesticity, in a single environment, R, to improve the support vector machine classifier's performance. In addition, we evaluate and compare the performances of several combinations used in the different steps of the method with a simulation experiment. The proposed method improves the classifier's performance compared to using the whole feature set in all the cases we investigate. Additionally, in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, our approach improves classification performance compared to several approaches in the literature. When using the corrected degree of domesticity as a network degree centrality measure, it is important to use our correction to compare nodes/features with no connection outside of their community since it provides a more accurate ranking among the features. Due to the nature of the hybrid method, which includes social network analysis, it is necessary to investigate possible combinations to provide an optimal solution for the microarray data used in the research.",

Logistic regression models explored cross-sectional relationships at the 3HC between HRQoL and objective global cognitive function (n\u2009=\u20094435; poor cognition\u2009=\u2009lowest performance decile). The cohort was examined as a whole and by age-group (50-69, \u2265\u200970), considering socio-demographics and co-morbidity. Higher MCS scores were associated with lower chance of incident dementia (Hazard Ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20090.74, 95% CI 0.68-0.81) and lower odds of poor cognition (Odds Ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20090.82, 0.76-0.89), with findings similar by age-group. Higher PCS scores were not associated with dementia in the whole cohort (HR\u2009=\u20090.93, 0.84-1.04) or considering age-groups; and were only associated with poor cognition in younger participants (OR\u2009=\u20090.81, 0.72-0.92). Similarly, associations between higher scores on subscales pertaining to mental, but not physical, HRQoL and lower dementia incidence were observed. Lower mental HRQoL precedes dementia diagnosis in middle-aged and older British adults.",

        "AbstractText": "Arsenic and antimony are metalloids with profound effects on biological systems and human health. Both elements are toxic to cells and organisms, and exposure is associated with several pathological conditions including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. At the same time, arsenic- and antimony-containing compounds are used in the treatment of multiple diseases. Although these metalloids can both cause and cure disease, their modes of molecular action are incompletely understood. The past decades have seen major advances in our understanding of arsenic and antimony toxicity, emphasizing genotoxicity and proteotoxicity as key contributors to pathogenesis. In this review, we highlight mechanisms by which arsenic and antimony cause toxicity, focusing on their genotoxic and proteotoxic effects. The mechanisms used by cells to maintain proteostasis during metalloid exposure are also described. Furthermore, we address how metalloid-induced proteotoxicity may promote neurodegenerative disease and how genotoxicity and proteotoxicity may be interrelated and together contribute to proteinopathies. A deeper understanding of cellular toxicity and response mechanisms and their links to pathogenesis may promote the development of strategies for both disease prevention and treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Myelomonocytic and monocytic acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subtypes are intrinsically resistant to venetoclax-based regimens. Identifying targetable vulnerabilities would limit resistance and relapse. We previously documented the synergism of venetoclax and cardiac glycoside (CG) combination in AML. Despite preclinical evidence, the repurposing of cardiac glycosides (CGs) in cancer therapy remained unsuccessful due to a lack of predictive biomarkers. We report that the ex vivo response of AML patient blasts and the in vitro sensitivity of established cell lines to the hemi-synthetic CG UNBS1450 correlates with the ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 1 (ATP1A1)/BCL2 like 1 (BCL2L1) expression ratio. Publicly available AML datasets identify myelomonocytic/monocytic differentiation as the most robust prognostic feature, along with core-binding factor subunit beta (CBFB), lysine methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A) rearrangements, and missense Fms-related receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations. Mechanistically, BCL2L1 protects from cell death commitment induced by the CG-mediated stepwise triggering of ionic perturbation, protein synthesis inhibition, and MCL1 downregulation. In vivo, CGs showed an overall tolerable profile while impacting tumor growth with an effect ranging from tumor growth inhibition to regression. These findings suggest a predictive marker for CG repurposing in specific AML subtypes.",

Induction of progenitor identity and cell plasticity, for example, epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity, are critical outcomes of reactivated embryonic programs. In this Review, we describe molecular players governing reactivated embryonic genetic programs, their role during disease progression, their similarities and differences and lineage reversion in pathology and discuss associated therapeutics and drug-resistance mechanisms across many organs. We also discuss the diversity of reactivated programs in different disease contexts.

In a randomized phase II-like preclinical trial in patient-derived xenografts, imetelstat effectively diminishes AML burden and preferentially targets subgroups containing mutant NRAS and oxidative stress-associated gene expression signatures. Unbiased, genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 editing identifies ferroptosis regulators as key mediators of imetelstat efficacy. Imetelstat promotes the formation of polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids, causing excessive levels of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress.

The current status of docetaxel and cabazitaxel in the treatment sequence for metastatic prostate cancer needs to be clarified. Overview of the existing literature regarding approval, dosage and new combination options for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Taxanes represent one, but no longer the only treatment option for mCRPC. Previously, monotherapy was standard of care in the first and second line for mCRPC; nowadays taxanes are thrusted in the background due to new encouraging drug options. Based on the promising data of docetaxel in triple therapy setting for hormone-sensitive stage, its role as monotherapy in mCRPC needs to be clarified. Cabazitaxel is an alternative to PSMA radioligand therapy after failure of novel hormonal therapy (NHT) and docetaxel. Therapy adherence for taxanes can be significantly improved by dosage adjustments. Both treatment-related neuroendocrine prostate cancer (t-NEPC) and aggressive variant of prostate cancer (AVPC) represent a\u00a0challenge for experienced uro-oncologists. Here, the combination of taxane plus platinum represents a\u00a0promising option. Taxanes are indicated in different stages of metastatic prostate cancer. Their use, particularly in combination with other drugs, appears to be promising. Traditional sequential taxane monotherapy regimens will be challenged by novel systemic therapy approaches. HINTERGRUND: Seit 2\u00a0Jahrzehnten werden Taxane in der Monotherapie des metastasierten Prostatakarzinoms eingesetzt.

Der Beitrag gibt eine \u00dcbersicht der vorhandenen Literatur bez\u00fcglich Zulassung, Dosierung und neuer Therapieoptionen beim metastasierten kastrationsresistenten Prostatakarzinom (mCRPC). Taxane stellen eine, aber nicht mehr DIE Therapieoption beim mCRPC dar. Vormals DER Standard als Monotherapie in der Erst- und Zweitlinie bei mCRPC, stehen Taxane aufgrund neuer vielversprechender Medikamentenoptionen nicht mehr im prim\u00e4ren Vordergrund. Aufgrund der Einsatzm\u00f6glichkeit von Docetaxel im hormonsensitiven Stadium gilt es, seinen sinnvollen Einsatz als Monotherapie beim mCRPC zu kl\u00e4ren. Cabazitaxel ist eine Alternative zur PSMA-Radioligandentherapie (\u201eprostate-specific membrane antigen\u201c) nach Versagen von NHT (neue hormonelle Therapie) und Docetaxel. Durch Anpassung der Medikamentendosis an die Komorbidit\u00e4ten des mCRPC-Patienten kann die Therapieakzeptanz deutlich verbessert werden. Sowohl das behandlungsinduzierte neuroendokrine Prostatakarzinom (t-NEPC) als auch die aggressiven Prostatakarzinomvarianten (AVPC) stellen eine Herausforderung f\u00fcr erfahrene Uroonkolog*innen dar. Hier ist die Kombination aus Taxan plus Platinderivat eine vielversprechende Option. Taxane haben ihre Indikation in verschiedenen Stadien des metastasierten Prostatakarzinoms.

Although liver resection with thrombectomy is the only curative treatment, there is no consensus on the therapeutic options for managing these rare cases. The patient was a 67-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor thrombus in the right atrium. In February 2003, cavo-atrial thrombectomy was first performed using cardiopulmonary bypass with heparinization and cardiac arrest. After thrombectomy, right hepatectomy was performed. The total operative time was 10\u00a0h 48\u00a0min. Moreover, the total blood loss was 7267\u00a0mL. The patient recovered uneventfully except for right pleural effusion. He was cancer-free for approximately 9\u00a0years. A new lesion in the remnant liver was detected in March 2012. He underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, followed by sequential administration of sorafenib and sunitinib. Radiation therapy was also administered. Eventually, the patient expired 6\u00a0years after recurrence.

However, circRNAs have not been systematically identified in breast cancer (BC) as crucial regulators in multitudinous biological processes. This study is conducted to explore novel circRNAs in BC and the corresponding mechanisms of their action. The circRNA expression profile and RNA-sequencing data about BC were respectively downloaded from public database. Differentially expressed circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs were identified by fold change filtering. The competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) network was established based on the relationship between circular RNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of the overlapped genes were carried out to predict the potential functions and mechanisms of circRNAs in BC. The CytoHubba plugin in Cytoscape was applied to identify the hub genes from the PPI regulatory network. Kaplan-Meier plotter was used to perform survival analysis of these hub genes further. Real-time PCR was performed to test the expression of circRNA in BC tissues. Cell function studies including transwell analysis and CCK-8 analysis were used to investigate circRNAs' biological functions. A total of seven circRNAs exhibiting differential expression were identified in this study. After the intersection between the predicted target miRNA and the down-regulated differential miRNAs (DEmiRNAs), circRNA-miRNA interactions involving 3 circRNAs and 4 miRNAs were identified. Venn diagram was utilized to intersect the predicted target genes of the 4 miRNAs and the down-regulated differential genes in BC, and 149 overlapped genes were screened out ulteriorly. Additionally, we built a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and selected six hub genes. Moreover, the survival data of BC patients suggested that low expression of ADIPOQ, LPL and LEP were significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Results from real-time PCR indicated that hsa_circ_0000375 was significantly down-regulated in breast cancer tissues. Functional in vitro experiments showed that over-expression of hsa_circ_0000375 can restrain proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of breast cancer cells. Further verification indicated that hsa_circ_0000375 exerted its anti-oncogene effect via sponge of miR-7706.

However, how the ferroptosis surveillance system is regulated during cancer development remains largely unknown. Here, we report that the YTHDC1-mediated m6A epigenetic regulation of FSP1 alleviates the FSP1-dependent ferroptosis suppression that partially contributes to the tumor suppressive role of YTHDC1 in lung cancer progression. YTHDC1 knockdown promoted the lung tumor progression and upregulated FSP1 protein level that resulted in ferroptosis resistance of lung cancer cells. Silencing FSP1 abrogated YTHDC1 knockdown-induced proliferation increase and ferroptosis resistance. Mechanistically, YTHDC1 binding to the m6A sites in the FSP1 3'-UTR recruited the alternative polyadenylation regulator CSTF3 to generate a less stable shorter 3'-UTR contained FSP1 mRNA, whereas YTHDC1 downregulation generated the longer 3'-UTR contained FSP1 mRNA that is stabilized by RNA binding protein HuR and thus led to the enhanced FSP1 protein level.

We identified and validated PPARGC1A, DUSP1, APOBEC3A, AIRE, HDAC11, HMGB2 and APOBEC3B as prognostic biomarkers for the risk model construction. The model was also related to immune cell infiltration, and the expression of CD48, CTLA4, HHLA2, TNFSF9 and TNFSF15 was higher in high-risk group. HCC patients in the high-risk group were more sensitive to Axitinib, Docetaxel, Erlotinib, and Metformin. In this study, we construct a prognostic model of immune-associated chromatin regulators, which provides new ideas and research directions for the accurate treatment of HCC.",

        "AbstractText": "In the present study, we present comparative outcomes of radical prostatectomy after whole-gland therapy (wg-SRARP) and focal gland therapy (f-SRARP). The study assessed 339 patients who underwent salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (SRARP); 145 patients who had primary focal therapy and 194 patients who had primary whole-gland treatment. SRARP was performed in all cases using a standardized technique developed at respective institutes with the da Vinci Xi Surgical System. Our primary endpoint was the comparison of the functional and oncological outcomes between the groups. Cox proportional hazard was used to study the functional and oncological outcomes. The median total operative time for f-SRARP was 18\u00a0min higher than wg-RARP (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Higher rates of nerve-sparing were performed in f-SRARP (focal vs whole gland; bilateral-15.2% vs 9.3%; unilateral 49% vs 28.4%; p\u2009<\u20090.001). wg-SRARP had higher rates of ISUP 5 (26.3% vs 19.3%; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and deferred ISUP score due to altered pathology (14.8% vs 0.7; p\u2009<\u20090.001), while f-SRARP had higher rates of ISUP 4 (11.7% vs 10.7%; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and\u2009\u2265\u2009pT3a (64.8% vs 51.6%; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Positive margins were significantly higher with f-SRARP (26.2% vs 10.3%; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Functional outcomes were poor in both the groups. However, postoperative continence was higher and faster in patients who had f-SRARP compared to wg-SRARP (69% vs. 54.6%; p\u2009=\u20090.013). We could not identify statistically significant difference in postoperative potency recovery and biochemical recurrence. We present the largest multi-institutional analyses of f-SRARP and wg-SRARP. SRARP is challenging wherein patients have adverse pathological features and increased surgical complexity irrespective of the primary treatment. Focal therapy group had higher rates of nerve-sparing, however, with increased positive surgical margins. Both groups had poor functional outcomes regardless of nerve-sparing degree, indicating significant ipsilateral and contralateral damage to tissues surrounding the prostate during primary treatment. We believe that this analysis is crucial for counseling patients regarding expected outcomes before performing a salvage treatment following ablative therapy failure.",

We evaluate the impact of the surgical approach on 30-day outcomes in PC patients who underwent NAT. Patients with PC who had NAT followed by MIPD or open pancreatoduodenectomy (OPD) were identified from a pancreatectomy-targeted dataset (2014-2020) of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Comparisons were made between MIPD and OPD within NAT groups. A total of 5588 patients were analyzed. Of those, 4907 underwent OPD and 476 underwent MIPD. In addition, 3559 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone and 1830 received neoadjuvant chemoradiation. In the chemotherapy-alone group, the MIPD subgroup had lower rates of any complication (38.2% vs. 45.8%, P = 0.005), but there were no differences in mortality (2.1% for MIPD vs 1.9% for OPD, P=0.8) or serious complication (11.8% for MIPD vs 15% for OPD, P=0.1). On multivariable analysis, MIPD was independently predictive of lower rates of any complication (OR: 0.74, 95% CI 0.6-0.93, P = 0.0009), CR-POPF (OR: 0.58, 95% CI 0.35-0.96, P = 0.04), and shorter LOS (estimate: -1.03, 95% CI -1.73 to -0.32, P = 0.004). In the chemoradiation group, patients undergoing MIPD had higher rates of preoperative diabetes (P < 0.05), but there were no significant differences in any outcomes between the two approaches in this group. MIPD is safe and feasible after NAT. Patients having neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone followed by MIPD had lower rates of complications, shorter LOS, and fewer CR-POPFs compared to OPD.",

        "AbstractText": "Tailored axillary surgery (TAS) is a novel surgical concept for clinical node-positive breast cancer. It consists of the removal of the sentinel lymph nodes (LNs), as well as palpably suspicious nodes. The TAS technique can be utilized in both the upfront and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) setting. This study assessed whether/how imaging-guided localization (IGL) influenced TAS. This was a prospective observational cohort study preplanned in the randomized phase-III OPBC-03/TAXIS trial. IGL was performed at the surgeon's discretion for targeted removal of LNs during TAS. Immediate back-up axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) followed TAS according to TAXIS randomization. Five-hundred patients were included from 44 breast centers in six countries, 151 (30.2%) of whom underwent NACT. IGL was performed in 84.4% of all patients, with significant variation by country (77.6-100%, p < 0.001). No difference in the median number of removed (5 vs. 4, p = 0.3) and positive (2 vs. 2, p = 0.6) LNs by use of IGL was noted. The number of LNs removed during TAS with IGL remained stable over time (p = 0.8), but decreased significantly without IGL, from six (IQR 4-6) in 2019 to four (IQR 3-4) in 2022 (p = 0.015). An ALND was performed in 249 patients, removing another 12 (IQR 9-17) LNs, in which a median number of 1 (IQR 0-4) was positive. There was no significant difference in residual nodal disease after TAS with or without IGL (68.0% vs. 57.6%, p = 0.2). IGL did not significantly change either the performance of TAS or the volume of residual nodal tumor burden. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03513614.",

Dysregulation of both VEGFR-2 and c-Met tyrosine kinases (TKs) could result in development and progression of different human cancers. Herein, we reported a novel series of 3-phenylquinazolin-2,4(1H,3H)-diones with thiourea moiety as dual VEGFR-2/c-Met TKs. Compared to sorafenib, cabozantinib went behind VEGFR-2 inhibition to target c-Met TK. The dual VEGFR-2/c-Met inhibitory activity of cabozantinib is due to a longer HB domain than that of sorafenib. Based on pharmacophore of cabozantinib analogues, we designed new dual VEGFR-2/c-Met TKs. We synthesized the target compounds via a new single pot three-component reaction. The cytotoxic activity of synthesized compounds was conducted against HCT-116 colorectal cancer cell line. Compounds 3c and 3e exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity against HCT-116 cell line (IC50 1.184 and 3.403\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively).

Variation of P- and N-substituents in the series of P2N2-ligands allows structure optimization of the Cu(I) complexes for the formation of the luminescent NPs with high chemical stability. The non-covalent modification of the NPs with triblock copolymer F-127 provides their high colloidal stability, followed by efficient cell internalization of the NPs visualized by their blue (\u2053450\u00a0nm) luminescence. The cytotoxic effects of the NPs toward the normal and some of cancer cells are significantly lower than those of the corresponding molecular complexes, which correlates with the chemical stability of the NPs in the solutions. The ability of the NPs to self-enhanced and H2O2-induced ROS generation is demonstrated in solutions and intracellular space by means of the standard electron spin resonance (ESR) and fluorescence techniques correspondingly. The anticancer specificity of the NPs toward HuTu 80 cancer cells and the apoptotic cell death pathway correlate with the intracellular level of ROS, which agrees well with the self-enhancing ROS generation of the NPs. The enhanced level of ROS revealed in HuTu 80 cells incubated with the NPs can be associated with the significant level of their mitochondrial localization.",

However, with the availability of biosimilar intravenous trastuzumab (IV-TZMb), there is a need to re-evaluate the recommendation. Hence, this study aims to compare the cost and resource use of SC-TZM and IV-TZMb in a Malaysian public healthcare facility. This activity-based costing study consists of (1) a retrospective medical record abstraction to determine patient details to estimate drug costs and (2) a time-motion study to quantify personnel time, patient time, and consumables used. The total cost of both SC-TZM and IV-TZMb were then compared using a cost-minimization approach, while differences were explored using an independent t-test. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to determine the impact of uncertainties in the analysis. The mean total cost of SC-TZM and IV-TZMb was USD 13,693 and USD 5,624 per patient respectively. The cost difference was primarily contributed by savings in drug cost of IV-TZMb, a reduction of USD 8,546 (SD\u2009=\u2009134), p\u2009<\u20090.001 compared to SC-TZM.

However, the role of lysosome associated genes (LSAGs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Transcriptome data and clinical data of HCC were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) databases. We identified differential expression of LSAGs by comparing tumor tissue with normal liver tissue. Subsequently, we used univariate COX analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) COX regression to construct the prognostic feature of LSAGs. Kaplan-Meier survival curve and receiver operating characteristic curve were used to evaluate the predictive ability of LSAGs feature. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were used for functional enrichment analysis of risk differential genes. The relationship between LSAGs score and tumor microenvironment and chemotherapy drug sensitivity was analyzed. Finally, the cellular communication of tumor cells with high and low expression of model LSAGs was explored. We identified sixteen prognostic associated LSAGs, four of which were selected to construct prognostic feature of LSAGs. Patients in the low LSAGs group had a better prognosis than those in the high LSAGs group. GO and KEGG analyses showed that risk differential genes were enriched in leukocyte migration, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The group with low LSAGs score had lower immune score. Patients in the high LSAGs group were more sensitive to drugs for chemotherapy. In addition, tumor cells with high expression of model LSAGs showed stronger association with immune cells through the interleukin-2 (IL2), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), adiponectin, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) signaling pathways. We established a LSAGs signature that had the ability to predict clinical prognosis and immune landscape, proposing potential therapeutic targets for HCC.",

Here, we describe a unique juxtaposition of caveola clusters and matrix degradative invadosomes at contact sites between the plasma membrane of cancer cells and constricting fibrils both in 2D and 3D type I collagen matrix environments. Preferential association between caveolae and straight segments of the fibrils, and between invadosomes and bent segments of the fibrils, was observed along with matrix remodelling. Caveola recruitment precedes and is required for invadosome formation and activity. Reciprocally, invadosome disruption results in the accumulation of fibril-associated caveolae. Moreover, caveolae and the collagen receptor \u03b21 integrin co-localize at contact sites with the fibrils, and integrins control caveola recruitment to fibrils. In turn, caveolae mediate the clearance of \u03b21 integrin and collagen uptake in an invadosome-dependent and collagen-cleavage-dependent mechanism. Our data reveal a reciprocal interplay between caveolae and invadosomes that coordinates adhesion to and proteolytic remodelling of confining fibrils to support tumour cell dissemination.",

We report here that, unexpectedly, RCCD1 is also localized in mitochondria. We show that RCCD1 resides in the mitochondrial matrix, where it interacts with the mitochondrial contact site/cristae organizing system (MICOS) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to regulate mtDNA transcription, oxidative phosphorylation, and the production of reactive oxygen species. Interestingly, RCCD1 is upregulated under hypoxic conditions, leading to decreased generation of reactive oxygen species and alleviated apoptosis favoring cancer cell survival. We show that RCCD1 promotes breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro and accelerates breast tumor growth in vivo. Indeed, RCCD1 is overexpressed in breast carcinomas, and its level of expression is associated with aggressive breast cancer phenotypes and poor patient survival. Our study reveals an additional dimension of RCCD1 functionality in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis, whose dysregulation inflicts pathologic states such as breast cancer.",

The cell membrane coating is engineered to express a SpyCatcher membrane anchor that can readily form a covalent bond with any moiety modified with SpyTag. To demonstrate the broad utility of this technique, three unique targeted CNP formulations are generated using different classes of targeting ligands, including a designed ankyrin repeat protein, an affibody and a single-chain variable fragment. In vitro, the modified nanoparticles exhibit enhanced affinity towards cell lines overexpressing the cognate receptors for each ligand. When formulated with a chemotherapeutic payload, the modularly functionalized nanoparticles display strong targeting ability and growth suppression in a murine tumour xenograft model of ovarian cancer.

Here, we report upregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) upon senescence, particularly in some stromal cell lines. Senescent cells display a PDK4-dependent increase in aerobic glycolysis and enhanced lactate production but maintain mitochondrial respiration and redox activity, thus adopting a special form of metabolic reprogramming. Medium from PDK4+ stromal cells promotes the malignancy of recipient cancer cells in vitro, whereas inhibition of PDK4 causes tumor regression in vivo. We find that lactate promotes reactive oxygen species production via NOX1 to drive the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, whereas PDK4 suppression reduces DNA damage severity and restrains the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. In preclinical trials, PDK4 inhibition alleviates physical dysfunction and prevents age-associated frailty.

        "AbstractText": "The use of the laparoscopic approach for the treatment of carcinomatosis from epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the short-term outcomes of both laparoscopic and open approach for interval CRS+HIPEC in a matched cohort of patients with advanced EOC. A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database including 254 patients treated with interval CRS-HIPEC between January 2016 and December 2021 was performed. Patients with primary disease and limited carcinomatosis (PCI\u2009\u2264\u200910) were selected. A comparative analysis of patients treated by either open (O-CRS-HIPEC) or the laparoscopic (L-CRS-HIPEC) approach was conducted. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and perioperative outcomes were analysed. Fifty-three patients were finally selected and enrolled into two comparable groups in this study. Of these, 14 patients were treated by interval L-CRS-HIPEC and 39 by interval O-CRS-HIPEC. The L-CRS-HIPEC group had a shorter hospital stay (5.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9 vs. 9.7\u2009\u00b1\u20099.8\u00a0days; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and a shorter time to return to systemic chemotherapy (4.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9 vs. 10.3\u2009\u00b1\u200916.8\u00a0weeks; p\u2009=\u20090.003). There were no significant differences in postoperative complications between both groups. The 2-year OS and DFS was 100% and 62% in the L-CRS-HIPEC group versus 92% and 60% in the O-CRS-HIPEC group, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.96; p\u2009=\u20090.786). This study suggests that the use of interval L-CRS-HIPEC for primary advanced EOC is associated with shorter hospital stay and return to systemic treatment while obtaining similar oncological results compared to the open approach. Further prospective research is needed to recommend this new approach for these strictly selected patients.",

A survey of EAES members prioritized this topic to be addressed by a clinical practice guideline. The aim of the study was to develop evidence-informed clinical practice recommendations on the use of bowel preparation before minimally invasive colorectal surgery, through evidence synthesis and a structured evidence-to-decision framework by an interdisciplinary panel of stakeholders. This is a collaborative project of EAES, SAGES, and ESCP. We updated a previous systematic review and performed a network meta-analysis of interventions. We appraised the certainty of the evidence for each comparison, using the GRADE and CINeMA methods. A panel of general and colorectal surgeons, infectious diseases specialists, an anesthetist, and a patient representative discussed the evidence in the context of benefits and harms, the certainty of the evidence, acceptability, feasibility, equity, cost, and use of resources, moderated by a GIN-certified master guideline developer and chair. We developed the recommendations in a consensus meeting, followed by a modified Delphi survey. The panel suggests either oral antibiotics alone prior to minimally invasive right colon resection or mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) plus oral antibiotics; MBP plus oral antibiotics prior to minimally invasive left colon and sigmoid resection, and prior to minimally invasive right colon resection when there is an intention to perform intracorporeal anastomosis; and MBP plus oral antibiotics plus enema prior to minimally invasive rectal surgery\u00a0(conditional recommendations); and recommends MBP plus oral antibiotics prior to minimally invasive colorectal surgery, when there is an intention to localize the lesion intraoperatively (strong recommendation).

Therefore, there is an urgent need for more studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, both to enhance its effectiveness and prevent its deleterious effects. This study presents the chronology of antibodies during six months after infection in hospitalized patients and the kinetics of serum soluble mediators of the cellular response triggered by SARS-CoV-2. Samples and clinical data from 330 patients hospitalized at the Hospital da Baleia in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, who were suspected of having COVID-19, were collected at the time of hospitalization and during 6\u00a0months after infection. The immune response was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry. There was a significant difference in IgM specific antibody titers from the 7th to 60th days after infection between COVID-19 negative and positive patients. Soon after 60\u00a0days after infection, antibody levels started to reduce, becoming similar to the antibody levels of the COVID-19 negative patients. IgG specific antibodies started to be detectable after 9\u00a0days of infection and antibody levels were comparatively higher in positive patients as soon as after 7\u00a0days. Furthermore, IgG levels remained higher in these patients during the complete period of 180\u00a0days after infection. The study observed similar antibody profiles between different patient groups. The soluble systemic biomarkers evaluated showed a decrease during the six months after hospitalization, except for CCL11, CXCL8, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, IL-6, IFN-g, IL-17, IL-5, FGF-basic, PDGF, VEGF, G-CSF, and GM-CSF. The results indicate that IgM antibodies are more prominent in the early stages of infection, while IgG antibodies persist for a longer period. Additionally, the study identified that patients with COVID-19 have elevated levels of biomarkers after symptom onset, which decrease over time.",

Secondary, prognostic biological aspects were investigated by translational analysis of plasma samples. The study enrolled patients with rectal cancer and lung metastases. At inclusion, patients underwent a standard MRI scan of the brain. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) level was measured by a direct fluorescence assay (DFA), and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by ddPCR. BM was detected in one of twenty-nine included patients. Patients had higher cfDNA levels than healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Patients with the primary tumor in situ had higher cfDNA levels than those with resected primary tumor (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Patients with liver involvement had higher cfDNA levels (p\u2009=\u20090.12) and circulating tumor DNA levels (p\u2009=\u20090.01) than those without liver involvement. In conclusion, the modest incidence of BM does not justify routine MRI of the brain in this selected population. cfDNA by DFA could be a valuable tool when planning treatment and follow-up for CRC patients. Future studies should focus on identifying further characteristics and biomarkers associated with a high risk of BM, enhancing the possibility for early intervention.",

A web-based gene browser was also developed. We integrated histopathological assessments, transcriptomic data and 5.67 million days of time-stamped longitudinal electronic health record data to define disease-stage-specific gene expression signatures, pathogenic hepatic cell subpopulations and master regulator networks associated with adverse outcomes in MASLD. We constructed a 15-gene transcriptional risk score to predict future hepatic decompensation events (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.86, 0.81 and 0.83 for 1-, 3- and 5-year risk, respectively).

This study aimed to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of single-port (SP) robotic distal gastrectomy (SPRDG) for patients with gastric cancer using the da Vinci SP system (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). This study was designed as a single-arm prospective phase I/II clinical trial of SPRDG (first posted date: 21/09/2021, NCT05051670; clinicaltrials.gov). SPRDG using the da Vinci SP system was performed on 19 patients with gastric cancer between December 2021 and October 2022. The primary outcome was the safety of SPRDG as measured by major postoperative complications. The secondary outcomes were operation time, bleeding amount, bowel motility recovery, and length of hospital stay. SPRDG was performed in all 19 patients without unexpected events, such as use of additional trocars or conversion to laparoscopic or open surgery. No major complications occurred postoperatively (0/19, 0.0%). The mean operation time was 218\u00a0min (range 164-286\u00a0min). The mean hospital stay duration was 3.2\u00a0days (range 2-4\u00a0days). This phase I/II clinical trial, performed by a single expert surgeon, demonstrated the safety and feasibility of SPRDG with the da Vinci SP system in selected patients with gastric cancer.

Typically, neo-N-termini are identified by chemical derivatization of the N-terminal amine with (N-Succinimidyloxycarbonylmethyl)tris(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)phosphonium\u00a0bromide (TMPP) followed by proteolysis and mass spectrometric analysis. Detection of the TMPP-labeled peptide is achieved by mapping the peptide sequence to the product ion spectrum derived from collisional activation. The site-specific localization of the TMPP tag enables unambiguous determination of the true N-terminus or neo-N-termini. In addition to backbone product ions, TMPP reporter ions at m/z 573, formed via collision-induced dissociation, can be diagnostic for the presence of a processed N-termini. However, reporter ions generated by collision-induced dissociation may be uninformative because of their low abundance. We demonstrate a novel high-throughput LC-MS method for the facile generation of the TMPP reporter ion at m/z 533 and, in some instances m/z 590, upon electron transfer dissociation. We further demonstrate the diagnostic utility of TMPP labeled peptides derived from a total cell lysate shows high degree of specificity towards selective N-terminal labeling over labeling of lysine and tyrosine and highly-diagnostic Receiver Operating Characteristic's (ROC) of TMPP reporter ions of m/z 533\u00a0and m/z 590.

We investigated several extracellular matrix (ECM) structural proteins, ECM degrading enzymes, and ECM processing proteins involved in the ECM remodeling of the premetastatic niche. Our in vitro model consisted of lung fibroblasts, which were exposed to factors secreted by nonmalignant breast epithelial cells, nonmetastatic breast cancer cells, or metastatic breast cancer cells. We assessed ECM remodeling in vivo in premetastatic lungs of female mice growing orthotopic primary breast tumor xenografts, as compared to lungs of control mice without tumors. Premetastatic lungs contained significantly upregulated Collagen (Col) Col4A5, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) MMP9 and MMP14, and decreased levels of MMP13 and lysyl oxidase (LOX) as compared to control lungs. These in vivo findings were consistent with several of our in vitro cell culture findings, which showed elevated Col14A1, Col4A5, glypican-1 (GPC1) and decreased Col5A1 and Col15A1 for ECM structural proteins, increased MMP2, MMP3, and MMP14 for ECM degrading enzymes, and decreased LOX, LOXL2, and prolyl 4-hydroxylase alpha-1 (P4HA1) for ECM processing proteins in lung fibroblasts conditioned with metastatic breast cancer cell media as compared to control. Taken together, our data show that premetastatic priming of lungs by primary breast tumors resulted in significant ECM remodeling which could facilitate metastasis by increasing interstitial fibrillar collagens and ECM stiffness (Col14A1), disruptions of basement membranes (Col4A5), and formation of leaky blood vessels (MMP2, MMP3, MMP9, and MMP14) to promote metastasis.",

Although exosomal lncRNAs have been reported to be involved in tumor development, whether secreted lncRNAs can encode peptides in recipient cells remains unknown. Here, we identified an exosomal lncRNA (lncAKR1C2) that was clinically correlated with lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer in a VEGFC-independent manner. Exo-lncAKR1C2 secreted from gastric cancer cells was demonstrated to enhance tube formation and migration of lymphatic endothelial cells, and facilitate lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in vivo. By comparing the metabolic characteristics of LN metastases and primary focuses, we found that LN metastases of gastric cancer displayed higher lipid metabolic activity. Moreover, exo-lncAKR1C2 encodes a microprotein (pep-AKR1C2) in lymphatic endothelial cells and promotes CPT1A expression by regulating YAP phosphorylation, leading to enhanced fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and ATP production. These findings highlight a novel mechanism of LNM and suggest that the microprotein encoded by exosomal lncAKR1C2 serves as a therapeutic target for advanced gastric cancer.",

Herein, Arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD)-modified Distearyl acylphosphatidyl ethanolamine (DSPE)-polyethylene glycol (PEG) (DSPE-PEG-RGD) micelle is prepared with a DSPE hydrophobic core to load the photothermal therapy (PTT) dye IR780 and the calcium efflux pump inhibitor curcumin. Then, the MNAzyme is distributed into the hydrophilic PEG layer and sealed with calcium phosphate through biomineralization. Moreover, RGD is attached to the outer tail of PEG for tumor targeting. The constructed nanomachine can release MNAzyme and the cofactor Ca2+ under acidic conditions and self-assemble into an active mode to cleave heat shock protein (HSP) mRNA by consuming the oncogene miRNA-21. Silencing miRNA-21 enhances the expression of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, leading to PTT sensitization. Meanwhile, curcumin maintains high intracellular Ca2+ to further suppress HSP-chaperone ATP by disrupting mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis. Therefore, pancreatic cancer is triple-sensitized to IR780-mediated PTT. The in vitro and in vivo results show that the MNAzyme-based nanomachine can strongly regulate HSP and PTEN expression and lead to significant pancreatic tumor inhibition under laser irradiation.",

The in vitro and in vivo function loss/acquisition tests were performed to evaluate the biological effects of IDO1 in EC. The mechanism of action of IDO1-regulation EC was explored through Firefly luciferase & Renilla luciferase activity reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and immunofluorescence (IF) assays. Clinically, IDO1 expression was abnormally elevated in EC and positively correlated with overall survival. Functionally, IDO1 was contributed to the proliferation and migration of EC cells. Mechanically, IDO1 regulated the expression of chemokine C-X-C ligand 10 (CXCL10) by promoting the entry of NF-\u03baB into the nucleus to combine with the promoter of CXCL10.

Different modelling frameworks are employed depending on the nature and scales of the system under study. For instance, signalling and regulatory networks can be simulated using Boolean modelling, whereas multicellular systems can be studied using agent-based modelling. Herein, we present PhysiBoSS 2.0, a hybrid agent-based modelling framework that allows simulating signalling and regulatory networks within individual cell agents. PhysiBoSS 2.0 is a redesign and reimplementation of PhysiBoSS 1.0 and was conceived as an add-on that expands the PhysiCell functionalities by enabling the simulation of intracellular cell signalling using MaBoSS while keeping a decoupled, maintainable and model-agnostic design. PhysiBoSS 2.0 also expands the set of functionalities offered to the users, including custom models and cell specifications, mechanistic submodels of substrate internalisation and detailed control over simulation parameters. Together with PhysiBoSS 2.0, we introduce PCTK, a Python package developed for handling and processing simulation outputs, and generating summary plots and 3D renders. PhysiBoSS 2.0 allows studying the interplay between the microenvironment, the signalling pathways that control cellular processes and population dynamics, suitable for modelling cancer. We show different approaches for integrating Boolean networks into multi-scale simulations using strategies to study the drug effects and synergies in models of cancer cell lines and validate them using experimental data. PhysiBoSS 2.0 is open-source and publicly available on GitHub with several repositories of accompanying interoperable tools.",

Respondents were recruited from the Sesen Bio target list based upon BCG utilization. In 2022, 100 urologists who manage patients with papillary tumors and 159 urologists who manage patients with CIS tumors filled out the survey. Most (78%) were community-based urologists. Study respondents managed an average of 33 (range: 6 to 158) CIS patients and 44 (range: 10 to 200) high-grade patients with papillary disease (without CIS) over the past 6 months. Approximately 70% of physicians identified either gemcitabine (\u223c40%) or mitomycin-C (\u223c30%) as the most often used intravesical chemotherapies for BCG unresponsive and BCG exposed groups. Most physicians reported the use of gemcitabine 2 g or mitomycin C 40 mg, in a specific regimen for induction (q weekly x 6 weeks) and maintenance (q monthly x 12 months). Responses were consistent across groups of BCG therapy (adequate vs BCG-exposed). Physicians were slightly more likely to use a maintenance regimen for the adequate BCG patient. The most common treatments received by patients with BCG-unresponsive and BCG-exposed NMIBC were intravesical chemotherapy (single-agent gemcitabine or mitomycin C), regardless of whether CIS or papillary disease was present.",

        "AbstractText": "Patients with synchronous (de novo) metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer appear to have worse survival outcomes and shorter time to develop castration resistance than patients with metachronous disease. However, the impact of synchronous metastasis on outcomes in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) setting is unknown in patients without prior exposure to androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs). In this study, we assessed the impact of initial timing of metastasis (synchronous vs metachronous) on survival outcomes of patients with new-onset mCRPC in a real-world population treated with first-line abiraterone or enzalutamide. Data were collected retrospectively from 323 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of mCRPC who received ARPIs as first-line therapy and had no prior exposure to ARPIs. The study endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival (OS). The results showed that median OS was significantly shorter in patients with synchronous disease than those with metachronous disease (26 vs 38.7 months, HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.09-1.86, P = .011). However, there was no difference in median progression-free survival. The initial timing of metastasis remained an independent factor associated with shorter OS in the multivariable analysis. These hypothesis-generating data, after external validation, may have implications in patient counseling, prognostication, and design of future clinical trials in the new-onset mCRPC setting.",

        "AbstractText": "Aberrant expressions of biomolecules occur much earlier than tumor visualized size and morphology change, but their common measurement strategies such as biopsy suffer from invasive sampling process. In vivo imaging of slight biomolecule expression difference is urgently needed for early cancer detection. Fluorescence of rare earth nanoparticles (RENPs) in second near-infrared (NIR-II) region makes them appropriate tool for in vivo imaging. However, the incapacity to couple with signal amplification strategies, especially programmable signal amplification strategies, limited their application in lowly expressed biomarkers imaging. Here we develop a 980/808 nm NIR programmed in vivo microRNAs (miRNAs) magnifier by conjugating activatable DNAzyme walker set to RENPs, which achieves more effective NIR-II imaging of early stage tumor than size monitoring imaging technique. Dye FD1080 (FD1080) modified substrate DNA quenches NIR-II downconversion emission of RENPs under 808 nm excitation. The miRNA recognition region in DNAzyme walker is sealed by a photo-cleavable strand to avoid \"false positive\" signal in systemic circulation. Upconversion emission of RENPs under 980 nm irradiation activates DNAzyme walker for miRNA recognition and amplifies NIR-II fluorescence recovery of RENPs via DNAzyme catalytic reaction to achieve in vivo miRNA imaging. This strategy demonstrates good application potential in the field of early cancer detection.",

In this study, we report a label-free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging approach for recognising and discriminating between TCRs and tumour-specific antigens by imaging the immune synapses of T cells. Various T cell stimuli, including agonistic antibodies, auxiliary molecules, and tumour-specific antigens, were modified on the electrode's surface to allow for their interaction with T cells bearing different TCRs. The formation of immune synapses activated by specific stimuli produced a negative (shadow) ECL image, from which T cell antigen recognition and discrimination were evaluated by analysing the spreading area and the recognition intensity of T cells.

        "AbstractText": "Radiotherapy plays a crucial role in the multimodal treatment of breast cancer. However, radioresistance poses a significant challenge to its effectiveness, hindering successful cancer therapy. Emerging evidence indicates that Nrf2 and HIF-1[Formula: see text] are critical regulators of cellular anti-oxidant responses and that their overexpression significantly promotes radioresistance. Wogonin (WG), the primary component isolated from Scutellaria baicalensis, exhibits potential antitumor and reversal of multidrug resistance activities. Nevertheless, the role of WG in radioresistance remains unclear. This study aims to explore the effects of WG on the radioresistance of breast cancer. Our results indicate that Nrf2 and HIF-1[Formula: see text] overexpression was observed in breast cancer tissues and was correlated with the histological grading of the disease. Radiation further increased the levels of Nrf2 and HIF-1[Formula: see text] in breast cancer cells. However, WG demonstrated the ability to induce cell apoptosis and reverse radioresistance by inhibiting the Nrf2/HIF-1[Formula: see text] pathway. These effects were also confirmed in xenograft mice models. Mechanistically, WG enhanced the level of the Nrf2 inhibitor Keap1 through reducing CpG methylation in the promoter region of the Keap1 gene. Consequently, the Nrf2/HIF-1[Formula: see text] pathway, along with the Nrf2- and HIF-1[Formula: see text]-dependent protective responses, were suppressed. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that WG can epigenetically regulate the Keap1 gene, inhibit the Nrf2/HIF-1[Formula: see text] pathway, induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells, and diminish acquired radioresistance. This study offers potential strategies to overcome the limitations of current radiotherapy for breast cancer.",

We analyzed annual trends for chemotherapy and immunotherapy use and compared utilization by demographic and clinical features. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine predictors of receiving immunotherapy vs chemotherapy. We identified 1301 patients with likely mCRPC. The majority were non Hispanic White (NHW - 63\u202f%) and 23\u202f% were non-Hispanic Black (NHB). Overall, there was increased utilization of immunotherapy in mCRPC from 2010 onwards, with the peak occurring in 2014 (4.6\u202f%). Chemotherapy use increased significantly, peaking in 2014 to 26.1\u202f%. However, the increased utilization of immunotherapy in the mCRPC was mainly seen in White patients: from 50\u202f% to 74.2\u202f% of the cohort. Conversely, there was a decrease in utilization of immunotherapy among Black mCPRC patients: from 50\u202f% to 25.8\u202f%.

Patients were analyzed for receipt of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline-concordant therapy. Impact on survival was evaluated using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis. 6655 patients (108 pediatric and 6547 young adult patients) with rectal cancer were included. Similar to previously published NCCN quality measures with overall guideline concordance approaching 90\u00a0% in adults, 89.6\u00a0% of pediatric and 84.6\u00a0% of young adult patients were classified as receiving pre-operative guideline-concordant therapy.

        "AbstractText": "A methodology to assess the immune microenvironment (IME) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been established, and the prognostic impact of IME factors is not yet clear. This study aimed to assess the IME factors and evaluate their prognostic values. We assessed CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density, forkhead box protein P3+ (Foxp3+ ) TIL density, and programmed death receptor ligand-1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) using a machine-learning algorithm in whole-slide imaging (WSI). We dichotomized patients according to TIL density or TPS and compared their clinical outcomes. Between September 2014 and September 2015, 165 patients with NSCLC were enrolled in the study. We assessed IME factors in the epithelium, stroma, and their combination. An improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) was observed in the high CD8+ TIL density group in the epithelium, stroma, and the combination of both. Moreover, the group with high PD-L1 TPS in the epithelium showed better DFS than that with low PD-L1 TPS. In the multivariate analysis, the CD8+ TIL density in the combination of epithelium and stroma and PD-L1 TPS in the epithelium were independent prognostic factors (hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20090.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20090.26-0.72; p\u2009=\u2009.001, HR\u2009=\u20090.49; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.30-0.81; p\u2009=\u2009.005, respectively). Our approach demonstrated that the IME factors are related to survival in patients with NSCLC. The quantitative assessment of IME factors enables to discriminate patients with high risk of recurrence, who can be the candidates for adjuvant therapy. Assessing the CD8+ TIL density in the combination of epithelium and stroma might be more useful than their individual assessment because it is a simple and time-saving analysis of TILs in WSI.",

        "AbstractText": "Tumor samples from the phase III IMpower010 study were used to compare two programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunohistochemistry assays (VENTANA SP263 and Dako 22C3) for identification of PD-L1 patient subgroups (negative, positive, low, and high expression) and their predictive value for adjuvant atezolizumab compared with best supportive care (BSC) in resectable early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PD-L1 expression was assessed by the SP263 assay, which measured the percentage of tumor cells with any membranous PD-L1 staining, and the 22C3 assay, which scored the percentage of viable tumor cells showing partial or complete membranous PD-L1 staining. When examining the concordance at the PD-L1-positive threshold (SP263: tumor cell (TC)\u22651%; 22C3: tumor proportion score (TPS)\u22651%), the results were concordant between assays for 83% of the samples. Similarly, at the PD-L1-high cut-off (SP263: TC\u226550%; 22C3: TPS\u226550%), the results were concordant between assays for 92% of samples. The disease-free survival benefit of atezolizumab over BSC was comparable between assays for PD-L1-positive (TC\u22651% by SP263: HR, 0.58 (95% CI: 0.40 to 0.85) vs TPS\u22651% by 22C3: HR, 0.65 (95% CI: 0.45 to 0.95)) and PD-L1-high (TC\u226550% by SP263: HR, 0.27 (95% CI: 0.14 to 0.53) vs TPS\u226550% by 22C3: HR, 0.31 (95% CI: 0.16 to 0.60)) subgroups. The SP263 and 22C3 assays showed high concordance and a comparable clinical predictive value of atezolizumab at validated PD-L1 thresholds, suggesting that both assays can identify patients with early-stage NSCLC most likely to experience benefit from adjuvant atezolizumab.

This study evaluated the effect of exercise during chemotherapy for breast cancer on long-term cardiovascular toxicity. This is a follow-up study of two previously performed randomised trials in patients with breast cancer allocated to exercise during chemotherapy or non-exercise controls. Cardiac imaging parameters, including T1 mapping (native T1, extracellular volume fraction (ECV)), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and global longitudinal strain (GLS), cardiorespiratory fitness, and physical activity levels, were acquired 8.5 years post-treatment. In total, 185 breast cancer survivors were included (mean age 58.9\u00b17.8 years), of whom 99% and 18% were treated with anthracyclines and trastuzumab, respectively. ECV and Native T1 were 25.3%\u00b12.5% and 1026\u00b151\u2009ms in the control group, and 24.6%\u00b12.8% and 1007\u00b144\u2009ms in the exercise group, respectively. LVEF was borderline normal in both groups, with an LVEF<50% prevalence of 22.5% (n=40/178) in all participants. Compared with control, native T1 was statistically significantly lower in the exercise group (\u03b2=-20.16, 95% CI -35.35 to -4.97). We found no effect of exercise on ECV (\u03b2=-0.69, 95% CI -1.62 to 0.25), LVEF (\u03b2=-1.36, 95% CI -3.45 to 0.73) or GLS (\u03b2=0.31, 95% CI -0.76 to 1.37). Higher self-reported physical activity levels during chemotherapy were significantly associated with better native T1 and ECV. In long-term breast cancer survivors, exercise and being more physically active during chemotherapy were associated with better structural but not functional cardiac parameters. The high prevalence of cardiac dysfunction calls for additional research on cardioprotective measures, including alternative exercise regimens. NTR7247.",

All patients with newly diagnosed endometrial cancer who underwent minimally invasive staging surgery from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2020 were identified retrospectively, and clinicopathologic and outcome data were obtained through chart review. Event probabilities and utility decrements were obtained through published clinical data and literature review. A decision model was created to compare 28 days of no post-operative pharmacologic prophylaxis, prophylactic enoxaparin, and prophylactic apixaban. Outcomes included no complications, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, clinically relevant non-major bleeding, and major bleeding. We assumed a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100\u2009000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Three of 844 patients (0.36%) had a VTE following minimally invasive staging surgery for endometrial cancer. In this model, no pharmacologic prophylaxis was less costly and more effective than prophylactic apixaban and prophylactic enoxaparin over all parameters examined. When all patients were assigned prophylaxis, prophylactic apixaban was both less costly and more effective than prophylactic enoxaparin. If the risk of DVT was \u22654.8%, prophylactic apixaban was favored over no pharmacologic prophylaxis. On Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis for the base case scenario, no pharmacologic prophylaxis was favored in 41.1% of iterations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100\u2009000 per QALY. In this cost-effectiveness model, no extended pharmacologic anticoagulation was superior to extended prophylactic enoxaparin and apixaban in clinically early-stage endometrial cancer patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery. This model supports use of prophylactic apixaban for 7 days post-operatively in select patients when the risk of DVT is 4.8% or higher.",

The estimates of price elasticity by price tiers are not available in the existing literature. Using cohort data of nearly 6000 individuals from the International Tobacco Control Bangladesh survey, this study estimated the own-price and cross-price elasticity and income elasticity of cigarette demand by price tiers in Bangladesh. The elasticity was estimated in three stages of consumer decisions: whether to smoke, which brand to smoke and finally, how many cigarettes to smoke per day. The decision to smoke cigarettes and the choice of cigarette brands were modelled using instrumental variable probability regression. The cigarette consumption per day was modelled using seemingly unrelated regression. The price elasticity of cigarette smoking prevalence with respect to the price of low-price cigarettes is -0.0487. The total elasticity for low-price cigarette consumption with respect to its own price is -0.1678. The own-price elasticity of smoking intensity of high-priced brands is -0.2512. The cross-price elasticity of low-price cigarette consumption with respect to high-price brand prices is 0.2643. The income elasticity of smoking prevalence overall is 0.0564. The income elasticity of daily consumption of low-price cigarettes is -0.1934 and for high-price cigarettes, it is 1.4044. The total income elasticity is 1.4608 for high-price cigarettes. A cigarette tax policy that raises the prices of both low-price and high-price brands-but increases prices in the low-price tier at a faster rate than in the high-price tier and increases prices of all brands at a pace faster than income growth-can effectively reduce cigarette consumption in Bangladesh.

We used human breast cancer-derived cells with high, low, and very low expression levels of AR, in addition to prostate cancer-derived LNCaP and DU-145 cells as a positive and negative controls to examine apoptosis caused by a synthetic peptide that targets ARs. The peptide was produced to inhibit AR transactivation in breast cancer cell lines. We then measured cell viability, caspase-3 activity, and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2.

        "AbstractText": "Cancer is a devastating health problem with inadequate treatment options. Many conventional treatments for solid-tumor cancers lack tumor specificity, which results in low efficacy and off-target damage to healthy tissues. Nanoparticle (NP)-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising minimally invasive treatment for solid-tumor cancers that has entered clinical trials. Traditionally, NPs used for PTT are coated with passivating agents and/or targeting ligands, but alternative coatings are being explored to enhance tumor specific delivery. In particular, cell-derived membranes have emerged as promising coatings that improve the biointerfacing of photoactive NPs, which reduces their immune recognition, prolongs their systemic circulation and increases their tumor accumulation, allowing for more effective PTT. To maximize treatment success, membrane-wrapped nanoparticles (MWNPs) that enable dual tumor imaging and PTT are being explored. These multifunctional theranostic NPs can be used to enhance tumor detection and/or ensure a sufficient quantity of NPs that have arrived in the tumor prior to laser irradiation. This review summarizes the current state-of-the-art in engineering MWNPs for combination cancer imaging and PTT and discusses considerations for the path toward clinical translation.",

Patient level data on 47\u2009695 women with a diagnosis of pure, primary DCIS between 1999 and 2017 in the Netherlands, UK, and US who underwent surgery, either breast conserving or mastectomy, often followed by radiotherapy or endocrine treatment, or both. The main outcomes were 10 year cumulative incidence of ipsilateral invasive breast cancer and ipsilateral DCIS estimated in relation to DCIS size and margin status, and adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals, estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses with multiple imputed data RESULTS: The 10 year cumulative incidence of ipsilateral invasive breast cancer was 3.2%. In women who underwent breast conserving surgery with or without radiotherapy, only adjusted risks for ipsilateral DCIS were significantly increased for larger DCIS (20-49 mm) compared with DCIS <20 mm (hazard ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.72). Risks for both ipsilateral invasive breast cancer and ipsilateral DCIS were significantly higher with involved compared with clear margins (invasive breast cancer 1.40, 1.07 to 1.83; DCIS 1.39, 1.04 to 1.87). Use of adjuvant endocrine treatment was not significantly associated with a lower risk of ipsilateral invasive breast cancer compared to treatment with breast conserving surgery only (0.86, 0.62 to 1.21). In women who received breast conserving treatment with or without radiotherapy, higher DCIS grade was not significantly associated with ipsilateral invasive breast cancer, only with a higher risk of ipsilateral DCIS (grade 1: 1.42, 1.08 to 1.87; grade 3: 2.17, 1.66 to 2.83). Higher age at diagnosis was associated with lower risk (per year) of ipsilateral DCIS (0.98, 0.97 to 0.99) but not ipsilateral invasive breast cancer (1.00, 0.99 to 1.00). Women with large DCIS (\u226550 mm) more often developed stage III and IV ipsilateral invasive breast cancer compared to women with DCIS <20 mm. No such association was found between involved margins and higher stage of ipsilateral invasive breast cancer.

The association of DCIS size and margin status with ipsilateral invasive breast cancer and ipsilateral DCIS was small.

Pathologic response assessment after neoadjuvant therapy is the potential analog to radiographic response for advanced disease. However, %RVT thresholds beyond pCR and major pathologic response (\u226410% RVT) have not been explored. Pathologic response was prospectively assessed in the randomized, phase 3 CheckMate 816 trial (NCT02998528), which evaluated neoadjuvant nivolumab (anti-PD-1) plus chemotherapy in patients with resectable lung cancer. RVT, regression, and necrosis were quantified (0%-100%) in PT and LNs using a pan-tumor scoring system and tested for association with EFS in a prespecified exploratory analysis. Regardless of LN involvement, EFS improved with 0% versus >0% RVT-PT (HR\u2009=\u20090.18). RVT-PT predicted EFS for nivolumab plus chemotherapy (AUC\u2009=\u20090.74); 2-year EFS rates were 90%, 60%, 57%, and 39% for patients with 0%-5%, >5%-30%, >30%-80%, and >80% RVT, respectively. Each 1% RVT associated with a 0.017 HR increase for EFS. Combining pathologic response from PT+LNs helped differentiate outcomes.

However, a complete description of how the features of mitochondria relate to the tumor microenvironment (TME) and immunological landscape of colorectal cancer (CRC) has yet to be made. We performed subgroup analysis on CRC patient data obtained from the databases using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering. Construct a prognostic model using the mitochondrial-related gene (MRG) risk score, and then compare it to other models for accuracy. Comprehensive analyses of the risk score, in conjunction with the TME and immune landscape, were performed, and the relationship between the model and different types of cell death, radiation and chemotherapy, and drug resistance was investigated. Results from immunohistochemistry and single-cell sequencing were utilized to verify the model genes, and a drug sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate possible therapeutic medicines. The pan-cancer analysis is utilized to further investigate the role of genes in a wider range of malignancies. We found that CRC patients based on MRG were divided into two groups with significant differences in survival outcomes and TME between groups. The predictive power of the risk score was further shown by building a prognostic model and testing it extensively in both internal and external cohorts. Multiple immune therapeutic responses and the expression of immunological checkpoints demonstrate that the risk score is connected to immunotherapy success. The correlation analysis of the risk score provide more ideas and guidance for prognostic models in clinical treatment. The TME, immune cell infiltration, and responsiveness to immunotherapy in CRC were all thoroughly evaluated on the basis of MRG features. The comparative validation of multiple queues and models combined with clinical data ensures the effectiveness and clinical practicality of MRG features.

However, the duration of immune consolidation and the efficacy and safety of different immune agents remain unclear. We conducted a systematic review of relevant studies. Methods We searched all the relevant studies in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. We also reviewed abstracts of relevant conferences, to prevent omissions. The meta-analysis was performed using Stata version 16.0. Results Chemoradiotherapy combined with immunotherapy can improve PFS (HR: 0.60, 95%CI :0.55-0.60) and OS (HR: 0.59, 95%CI :0.53-0.66) compared with no immunotherapy. The pooled 24-month PFS and 24-month OS rates were 48.1% (95% CI, 43.5%-52.7%) and 71.3% (95% CI, 67.3%-75.2%), respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that 24-month OS rates were 60.7% (95%CI, 51.0%-70.3%) and 77.4% (95%CI, 73.2%-81.7%) at 1 year and 2 years of immune consolidation, respectively. The pooled 1-year completion rate for immune consolidation was 35.6% (95%CI, 31.3%-39.8%). The pooled rate of pneumonitis for all grades was 41.7% (95%CI, 31.9%-51.9%). The pooled rate of pneumonitis \u2265 grade 3 was 6.7% (95%CI, 5.0%-8.5%). The incidence of pneumonitis \u2265 grade 3 after 1 year of immunotherapy is 4.8% (95%CI, 3.1%-6.5%). The incidence of pneumonitis \u2265 grade 3 after 2 years of immunotherapy is 5.1% (95%CI, 2.9%-7.3%). Conclusions Prolonging the duration of immunotherapy consolidation increases survival benefits in patients with stage III NSCLC without causing higher side effects. Older patients, due to high incidence of pneumonia and low immunotherapy completion rate, have less survival benefit.",

The predicted plan is then provided as initialisation to the optimiser for fine-tuning. &#xD;&#xD;Approach: 148 patients (training: 101; validation: 23; test: 24), treated for right breast cancer, are replanned to obtain a homogeneous database of 3-arc VMAT plans (PTVBreast: 45.57Gy; PTVBoost: 55.86Gy) according to the clinical protocol, using RapidPlanTM with automatic optimisation and extended convergence mode (clinical workflow). Projections of the CT and contours are created along the BEV of all control points and given as input to a U-net type CNN. The output are the MLC aperture and MU for all control points, from which a DICOM RTplan is built. This is imported and further optimised in the TPS using automatic optimisation without convergence mode, with clinical PTV objectives and OAR objectives based on the DVHs calculated from the imported plan (CNN workflow).&#xD;&#xD;Main results: Mean dose differences between the clinical and CNN workflow over the test set are 0.2\u00b10.5Gy at D95% and 0.6\u00b10.4Gy at D0.035cc of PTVBreast and -0.4\u00b10.3Gy at D95% and 0.7\u00b10.3Gy at D0.035cc of PTVBoost. For the OAR, they are -0.2\u00b10.2Gy for Dmean,heart and 0.04\u00b10.8Gy for Dmean,ipsilateral lung. The mean computation time is 60 and 25 minutes respectively. &#xD;&#xD;Significance: VMAT optimisation can be initialised by MLC apertures and MUs, directly predicted from patient anatomy using a CNN, reducing planning time with more than half while maintaining clinically acceptable plans. This procedure puts the planner in a supervising role over an AI-based treatment planning workflow. &#xD.",

        "AbstractText": "Different radiation therapy (RT) strategies, e.g., conventional fractionation RT (CFRT), hypofractionation RT (HFRT), stereotactic body RT (SBRT), adaptive RT, and re-irradiation are often used to treat head and neck (HN) cancers. Combining and/or comparing these strategies requires calculating biological effective dose (BED). The purpose of this study is to develop a practical process to estimate organ-specific radiobiologic model parameters that may be used for BED calculations in individualized RT planning for HN cancers. &#xD;Approach. Clinical dose constraint data for CFRT, HFRT and SBRT for 5 organs at risk (OAR) namely spinal cord, brainstem, brachial plexus, optic pathway, and esophagus obtained from literature were analyzed. These clinical data correspond to a particular endpoint. The linear-quadratic (LQ) and linear-quadratic-linear (LQ-L) models were used to fit these clinical data and extract relevant model parameters (alpha/beta ratio, gamma/alpha, dT and BED) from the iso-effective curve. The dose constraints in terms of equivalent physical dose in 2Gy-fraction (EQD2) were calculated using the obtained parameters.&#xD;Main results. The LQ-L and LQ models fitted clinical data well from the CFRT to SBRT with the LQ-L representing a better fit for most of the OARs. The alpha/beta values for LQ-L (LQ) were found to be 2.72 (2.11)Gy, 0.55 (0.30)Gy, 2.82 (2.90)Gy, 6.57 (3.86)Gy, 5.38 (4.71)Gy, and the dose constraint EQD2 were 55.91 (54.90)Gy, 57.35 (56.79)Gy, 57.54 (56.35)Gy, 60.13 (59.72)Gy and 65.66 (64.50)Gy for spinal cord, optic pathway, brainstem, brachial plexus, and esophagus, respectively. Additional two LQ-L parameters dT were 5.24Gy, 5.09Gy, 7.00Gy, 5.23Gy, and 6.16Gy, and gamma/alpha were 7.91, 34.02, 8.67, 5.62 and 4.95. &#xD;Significance. A practical process was developed to extract organ-specific radiobiological model parameters from clinical data. The obtained parameters can be used for biologically based radiation planning such as calculating dose constraints of different fractionation regimens.",

A well-known metabolic modification commonly observed in cancer cells has been termed the Warburg effect. This phenomenon is defined as a high preference for glucose uptake, and increased lactate production from that glucose, even when oxygen is readily available. Some anti-cancer drugs target the proposed Warburg effect, and some dietary regimens can function similarly. However, the most suitable dietary strategies for treating particular cancers are not yet well understood. The aim of this review was to describe findings regarding the impact of various proposed dietary regimens targeting the Warburg effect. The evidence suggests that combining routine cancer therapies with diet-based strategies may improve the outcome in treating cancer.

Yet, most analyses do not consider the transitory nature of children's behaviors and a more detailed approach could provide complimentary information. We aimed to explore various behavior profiles of survivors' daily and hourly physical activity patterns. We measured 8-18-year-old survivors' activity levels over 7\u00a0days using wrist accelerometry and cluster analysis. Of the 37 participant datasets, survivors engaged in mean (SD) 36.3 (19.0) min/day of MVPA and 4.1 (1.9) hrs/day of sedentary activity. The cluster analysis revealed five daily movement patterns: 'most active' (prevalence 11%), 'active' (22%), 'moderately active + moderately sedentary' (35%), 'moderately active + high sedentary' (5%) and 'least active' (27%). Younger survivors and those with less time since treatment completion were more likely to be in the active clusters. Hourly behaviors were characterized by short bursts of MVPA and moderate bouts of sedentary activity. Our approach provides an insightful analysis into the nature and timing of childhood cancer survivors' movement behaviours. Our findings may assist in the development of targeted interventions to improve physical activity levels.",

        "AbstractText": "Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have shifted the paradigm for drug development via target protein degradation. However, PROTACs may exhibit systemic toxicity to normal cells due to indiscriminate degradation and the utility of inhibitors as a warhead for protein targeting. Here, we propose a new strategy for developing activatable PROTACs for cell-specific degradation of histone deacetylase (HDAC) with minimal side effects via caging of the warhead. Molecular docking reveals that the hydroxyl group of the HDAC inhibitor is crucial for targeting. An enzyme-activatable PROTAC is designed by caging the hydroxyl group with the substrate for NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) overexpressed in cancer cells. We demonstrate that the caged PROTAC can be converted to its active form in response to NQO1. The enzyme-activatable PROTAC allows the efficient and specific degradation of HDAC6 and exerts antiproliferative activity in NQO1-positive cells. The generalizability of the design is further demonstrated by engineering a H2O2-responsive PROTAC for specific degradation of HDAC6 in cells with elevated H2O2. The strategy of caging the ligand for target proteins would afford a new dimension for developing activatable PROTACs with high specificity and minimal side effects.",

We report data from a phase 1 clinical trial, in which adults with LBCL were treated with autologous CD19 CAR-T cells (JCAR014) combined with escalating doses of the anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, durvalumab, starting either before or after CAR-T cell infusion. The addition of durvalumab to JCAR014 was safe and not associated with increased autoimmune or immune effector cell-associated toxicities. Patients who started durvalumab before JCAR014 infusion had later onset and shorter duration of cytokine release syndrome, and inferior efficacy, which was associated with slower accumulation of CAR-T cells and lower concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in blood. Initiation of durvalumab before JCAR014 infusion resulted in an early increase in soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) levels that coincided with the timing of maximal CAR-T cell accumulation in blood. In vitro, sPD-L1 induced dose-dependent suppression of CAR-T cell effector function, which could contribute to inferior efficacy observed in patients who received durvalumab before JCAR014. Despite the lack of efficacy improvement and similar CAR-T cell kinetics, ongoing durvalumab therapy after JCAR014 was associated with re-expansion of CAR-T cells in blood, late regression of CD19+ and CD19- tumors, and enhanced duration of response. Our results indicate that the timing of initiation of PD-L1 blockade is a key variable that affects outcomes after CD19 CAR-T cell immunotherapy for adults with LBCL.",

Aspacytarabine, an inactive prodrug of cytarabine, was evaluated as monotherapy in a phase 2b study, in patients with AML unfit for intensive chemotherapy (NCT03435848). Sixty-five patients with AML were treated with aspacytarabine 4.5 g/m2/d (equimolar to 3 g/m2/d cytarabine) for 6 doses per treatment courses. The median age was 75 years; 60.6% had de novo AML, 28.8% had AML secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome and 10.6% therapy-related AML. Overall, 36.9% achieved complete remission (CR) with full count recovery.

        "AbstractText": "Activation of the innate immune system counteracts tumor-induced immunosuppression. Hence, small molecule-based Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonists (TLR7/8a), which can modulate immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment along with the activation of innate immunity, are emerging as essential components of cancer immunotherapy. However, the clinical application of synthetic TLR7/8a therapies has been limited by systemic immune-associated toxicity and immune tolerance induced by uncontrolled stimulatory activities and repeated treatments. To address these limitations, a dynamic immunomodulation strategy incorporating masking and temporal recovery of the activity of TLR7/8a through prodrug-like TLR7/8a (pro-TLR7/8a) at the molecular level and a sustained and controlled release of active TLR7/8a from nanoliposome (pro-TLR7/8a) (NL(pro-TLR7/8)) in a macroscale depot were designed. Immunization with cationic NL(pro-TLR7/8) and anionic antigens triggered robust activation of innate immune cells as well as antigen-specific T cell responses, eliciting reprogramming of immunosuppressive cells (M2 macrophages and MDSCs) into tumor-suppressive cells (M1 macrophages), with decreased systemic adverse effects and immune tolerance. Combination treatment with NL(pro-TLR7/8a) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-L1) or nanoliposomes (Dox) had synergistic effects on antitumor immunity in various tumor models. The concept of pro-TLR7/8a suggested herein may facilitate the advancement of small-molecule-based immunomodulators for clinical translation and safe and effective cancer immunotherapy.

We examined the short- and long-term outcomes of risk-reducing total gastrectomy (RRTG) and its lesser-known impacts on health-related quality of life (QOL) in individuals with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome. Individuals who underwent RRTG as part of a single-institution natural history study of hereditary gastric cancers were examined. Clinicopathologic details, acute and chronic operative morbidity, and health-related QOL were assessed. Validated questionnaires were used to determine QOL scores and psycho-social-spiritual measures of healing. One hundred twenty-six individuals underwent RRTG because of a pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline CDH1 variant between October 2017 and December 2021. Most patients (87.3%; 110/126) had pT1aN0 gastric carcinoma with signet ring cell features on final pathology. Acute (<30 days) postoperative major morbidity was low (5.6%; 7/126) and nearly all patients (98.4%) lost weight after total gastrectomy. At 2 years after gastrectomy, 94% (64/68) of patients exhibited at least one chronic complication (ie, bile reflux, dysphagia, and micronutrient deficiency).

        "AbstractText": "Survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can be improved by allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) due to the anti-leukemic activity of T- and NK-cells from the donor. However, the use of alloHSCT is limited by donor availability, recipient age, and potential severe side effects. Similarly, the efficacy of immunotherapies directing autologous T-cells against tumor cells, including T-cell recruiting antibodies, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors is limited in AML due to multiple mechanisms of leukemia immune escape. This has prompted a search for novel immunostimulatory approaches. Here, we show that activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cellular energy balance, by the small molecule GSK621 induces calreticulin (CALR) membrane exposure in murine and human AML cells. When CALR is exposed on the cell surface, it serves as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that stimulates immune responses. We found that GSK621-treated murine leukemia cells promote the activation and maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Moreover, vaccination with GSK621-treated leukemia cells had a protective effect in syngeneic immunocompetent recipients bearing transplanted AMLs. This effect was lost in recipients depleted of CD4/CD8 T cells. Together, these results demonstrate that AMPK activation by GSK621 elicits traits of immunogenic cell death and promotes a robust immune response against leukemia. Pharmacologic AMPK activation thus represents a new potential target for improving the activity of immunotherapy in AML.",

The patient presented with recurrent, unilateral paracentral scotomas. There was localized loss of inner segment ellipsoid (EZ) and photoreceptor outer segment signals (IZ) in the pericentral retina of both eyes co-localizing with hyperreflective lesions on near-infrared reflectance. She subsequently lost vision (visual acuity = 20/200) in the right eye a year after consolidative peripheral blood stem cell transplantation complicated by steroid-resistant-chronic graft-versus-host disease. There was loss of the EZ and IZ signals corresponding to a dense central cone scotoma and multifocal electroretinograms depression. Near-infrared autofluorescence, fluorescein and optical coherence tomography angiography were within normal limits. Visual acuity (20/20) and retinal sensitivities improved with restoration of the EZ/IZ signals after oral prednisone and intravenous rituximab, but left a residual photoreceptor loss and paracentral scotoma. We propose that an immune-mediated microangiopathy may explain the protracted, recurrent course of primary photoreceptor abnormalities in our patient, which was further complicated by manifestations of chronic graft-versus-host disease following consolidative peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Outer retinal findings previously documented in leukemia may be explained by a similar mechanism.",

This study aimed to classify the symptom profiles of children with cancer and detect the possible predictors of the profiles and their effect on children's quality of life (QoL). A total of 272 children aged 8 to 17 years completed the Chinese version of the Pediatric Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System short form measures, the Pediatric QOL Inventory general core and cancer modules. Latent profile analysis was used to identify symptom profiles, and ordinal logistic regression and analysis of variance were used to examine predictors of symptom profile membership and profile differences on QoL. The best fit was a 3-profile model: low, moderate, and severe symptom distress. Children who had been inpatients in the past 7 days and were currently under treatment are more likely to have severe symptoms. Participants in the low symptom distress profile reported significantly greater QoL than those in the other profiles. Children with cancer are heterogeneous in their experience of symptoms. Children's characteristics, such as inpatient history and treatment status, are predictors of profiles; different symptom profiles are associated with QoL. This study identified distinct groups of patients who predictably experience higher symptoms and their predictors, which could help to place children within a profile and perhaps allow nurses to provide targeted supportive care to match children's specific symptom profile.",

However, the underlying mechanisms and biological significance of this regulation remain unclear. Here, we address these issues using structural and functional studies. We determined cryo-EM structures of the yeast Smc5/6 derived from complexes consisting of either all eight subunits or a subset of five subunits. Both structures reveal that Nse5-6 associates with Smc6's motor domain and the adjacent coiled-coil segment, termed the neck region. Our structural analyses reveal that this binding is compatible with motor domain dimerization but results in dislodging the Nse4 subunit from the Smc6 neck. As the Nse4-Smc6 neck interaction favors motor domain engagement and thus ATPase activity, Nse6's competition with Nse4 can explain how Nse5-6 disfavors ATPase activity. Such regulation could in principle differentially affect Smc5/6-mediated processes depending on their needs of the complex's ATPase activity. Indeed, mutagenesis data in cells provide evidence that the Nse6-Smc6 neck interaction is important for the resolution of DNA repair intermediates but not for replication termination. Our results thus provide a molecular basis for how Nse5-6 modulates the ATPase activity and cellular functions of Smc5/6.",

        "ArticleTitle": "The CRL3gigaxonin ubiquitin ligase-USP15 pathway governs the destruction of neurofilament proteins.",
        "AbstractText": "Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is caused by mutations in the GAN gene encoding for gigaxonin (GIG), which functions as an adaptor of the CUL3-RBX1-GIG (CRL3GIG) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The pathological hallmark of GAN is characterized by the accumulation of densely packed neurofilaments (NFs) in the axons. However, there are fundamental knowledge gaps in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which the ubiquitin-proteasome system controls the homeostasis of NF proteins. Recently, the deubiquitylating enzyme USP15 was reported to play a crucial role in regulating ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of CRL4CRBN substrate proteins. Here, we report that the CRL3GIG-USP15 pathway governs the destruction of NF proteins NEFL and INA. We identified a specific degron called NEFLL12 degron for CRL3GIG. Notably, mutations in the C-terminal Kelch domain of GIG, represented by L309R, R545C, and C570Y, disrupted the binding of GIG to NEFL and INA, leading to the accumulation of these NF proteins. This accounts for the loss-of-function mutations in GAN patients. In addition to regulating NFs, CRL3GIG also controls actin filaments by directly targeting actin-filament-binding regulatory proteins TPM1, TPM2, TAGLN, and CNN2 for proteasomal degradation. Thus, our findings broadly impact the field by providing fundamental mechanistic insights into regulating extremely long-lived NF proteins NEFL and INA by the CRL3GIG-USP15 pathway and offering previously unexplored therapeutic opportunities to treat GAN patients and other neurodegenerative diseases by explicitly targeting downstream substrates of CRL3GIG.",

        "AbstractText": "Over the last several decades, Brazil has become both the world's leading soy producer and the world's leading consumer of hazardous pesticides. Despite identified links between pesticide exposure and carcinogenesis, there has been little population-level research on the effects of pesticide intensification on broader human health in Brazil. We estimate the relationship between expanded soy production-and related community exposure to pesticides-on childhood cancer incidence using 15 y of data on disease mortality. We find a statistically significant increase in pediatric leukemia following expanded local soy production, but timely access to treatment mitigates this relationship. We show that pesticide exposure likely occurs via water supply penetration. Our findings represent only the tip of the iceberg for substantial health externalities of high-input crop production and land use change. Our results are of particular interest in developing contexts with demand for intensified food production systems and underscore the need for stronger regulation of pesticides and increased public health attention to exposure in the broader community.",

        "AbstractText": "The objective was to assess the value of routinely collected patient-reported health-related social needs (HRSNs) measures for predicting utilization and health outcomes. The authors identified Mayo Clinic patients with cancer, diabetes, or heart failure. The HRSN measures were collected as part of patient-reported screenings from June to December 2019 and outcomes (hospitalization, 30-day readmission, and death) were ascertained in 2020. For each outcome and disease combination, 4 models were used: gradient boosting machine (GBM), random forest (RF), generalized linear model (GLM), and elastic net (EN). Other predictors included clinical factors, demographics, and area-based HRSN measures-area deprivation index (ADI) and rurality. Predictive performance for models was evaluated with and without the routinely collected HRSN measures as change in area under the curve (AUC). Variable importance was also assessed. The differences in AUC were mixed. Significant improvements existed in 3 models of death for cancer (GBM: 0.0421, RF: 0.0496, EN: 0.0428), 3 models of hospitalization (GBM: 0.0372, RF: 0.0640, EN: 0.0441), and 1 of death (RF: 0.0754) for diabetes, and 1 model of readmissions (GBM: 0.1817), and 3 models of death (GBM: 0.0333, RF: 0.0519, GLM: 0.0489) for heart failure. Age, ADI, and the Charlson comorbidity index were the top 3 in variable importance and were consistently more important than routinely collected HRSN measures. The addition of routinely collected HRSN measures resulted in mixed improvement in the predictive performance of the models. These findings suggest that existing factors and the ADI are more important for prediction in these contexts. More work is needed to identify predictors that consistently improve model performance.",

        "AbstractText": "Metabolic reprogramming, as one of the characteristics of cancer, is associated with tumorigenesis, growth, or migration, and the modulation of metabolic pathways has emerged as a novel approach for cancer therapy. However, the conventional metabolism-mediated apoptosis process in tumor cells exhibits limited immunogenicity and inadequate activation of antitumor immunity. Herein, phospholipid-coated sodium citrate nanoparticles (PSCT NPs) are successfully prepared, which dissolve in tumor cells and then release significant amounts of citrate ions and Na+ ions. Massive quantities of ions lead to increased intracellular osmotic pressure, which activates the caspase-1/gasdermin D (GSDMD) mediated pyroptosis pathway. Simultaneously, citrate induces activation of the caspase-8/gasdermin C (GSDMC) pathway. The combined action of these two pathways synergistically causes intense pyroptosis, exhibiting remarkable antitumor immune responses and tumor growth inhibition. This discovery provides new insight into the potential of nanomaterials in modulating metabolism and altering cell death patterns to enhance antitumor immunotherapy.",

Here we use a live-cell 'ChReporter' method to identify cells with a single chromosomal loss in efforts to better understand differences in cell shape, motility, and growth. We focus on a standard lung cancer line and first show clonal populations that retain the ChReporter exhibit large differences in cell and nuclear morphology as well as motility. Phenotype metrics follow simple rules, including migratory persistence scaling with speed, and cytoskeletal differences are evident from drug responses, imaging, and single-cell RNA sequencing. However, a mechanotype-genotype relationship proves complex, motivating comparisons of clones that had either lost or retained a Chromosome-5 ChReporter. When lost, fluorescence-null cells show low expression of Chromosome-5 genes, including a key tumor suppressor APC that regulates MT's and proliferation. Colonies are compact, nuclei are rounded, and cells proliferate more, with drug results implicating APC, and patient survival data indicating an association in lung and other tumor-types. Visual identification of genotype with ChReporters can thus help clarify mechanotype and mechano-evolution.",

PDAC is known for its high proportion of stroma, which accounts for 90% of the tumor mass. The stroma is made up of extracellular matrix (ECM) and non-malignant cells such as inflammatory cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and lymphatic and blood vessels. Here, we decoupled the effects of the ECM on PDAC cell lines by culturing cells on surfaces coated with different ECM proteins. Our data show that the primary tumor-derived cell lines have different morphology depending on the ECM proteins on which they are cultured, while metastatic lesion-derived PDAC lines' morphology does not change with respect to the different ECM proteins. Similarly, ECM proteins modulate the proliferation rate and the gemcitabine sensitivity of the primary tumor PDAC cell lines, but not the metastatic PDAC lines. Lastly, transcriptomics analysis of the primary tumor PDAC cells cultured on different ECM proteins reveals the regulation of various pathways, such as cell cycle, cell adhesion molecules, and focal adhesion, including the regulation of several integrin genes that are essential for ECM recognition.",

This reduction in mortality has been accompanied by an average increase in overall survival and largely credited to the therapeutic advancements for the effective treatment of NSCLC. Numerous molecular alterations have been identified in NSCLC that have enabled the development of new drugs capable of targeting these changes and efficiently kill cancerous cells. New treatments to modulate patient's immune systems have been shown to be effective in stimulating natural immune cells to have an improved anti-cancer effect. While these types of approaches to treat cancer are providing new options for patients, leadership from the Food and Drug Administration recognized that the expansion of targeted therapy in NSCLC presented significant promise, but evaluation of the safety and efficacy of these new drugs would be slowed if new models for conducting clinical studies were not identified. Specifically, FDA recommended that a comprehensive approach be implemented to identify the patients that are the best candidates for these, and other new treatments based upon the molecular characteristics of their tumors, and more efficiently conduct the clinical studies necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new drugs. To address this growing challenge, leading lung cancer experts and stakeholders across academia, government, industry, and patient advocacy came together to design a clinical research approach that could serve as a sustainable infrastructure for new lung cancer treatments called the Lung Cancer Master Protocol.",

Bioinformatic analyses here identify hundreds of putative smORF peptides expressed in Drosophila imaginal leg discs. Thanks to a functional screen in leg, we found smORF peptides involved in morphogenesis, including the pioneer smORF peptides Pri. Since we identified its target Ubr3 in the epidermis and pri was known to control leg development through poorly understood mechanisms, we investigated the role of Ubr3 in mediating pri function in leg. We found that pri plays several roles during leg development both in patterning and in cell survival. During larval stage, pri activates independently of Ubr3 tarsal transcriptional programs and Notch and EGFR signaling pathways, whereas at larval pupal transition, Pri peptides cooperate with Ubr3 to insure cell survival and leg morphogenesis. Our results highlight Ubr3 dependent and independent functions of Pri peptides and their pleiotropy. Moreover, we reveal that the smORF peptide family is a reservoir of overlooked developmental regulators, displaying distinct molecular functions and orchestrating leg development.",

        "AbstractText": "The mitotic regulator, Aurora kinase B (AURKB), is frequently overexpressed in malignancy and is a target for therapeutic intervention. The compound, LXY18, is a potent, orally available small molecule that inhibits the proper localization of AURKB during late mitosis, without affecting its kinase activity. In this study, we demonstrate that LXY18 elicits apoptosis in cancer cells derived from various indications, but not in non-transformed cell lines. The apoptosis is p53-independent, triggered by a prolonged mitotic arrest and occurs predominantly in mitosis. Some additional cells succumb post-mitotic slippage. We also demonstrate that cancer cell lines refractory to AURKB kinase inhibitors are sensitive to LXY18. The mitotic proteins MKLP2, NEK6, NEK7 and NEK9 are known regulators of AURKB localization during the onset of anaphase. LXY18 fails to inhibit the catalytic activity of these AURKB localization factors. Overall, our findings suggest a novel activity for LXY18 that produces a prolonged mitotic arrest and lethality in cancer cells, leaving non-transformed cells healthy. This new activity suggests that the compound may be a promising drug candidate for cancer treatment and that it can also be used as a tool compound to further dissect the regulatory network controlling AURKB localization.",

To improve cancer patient outcomes and lower society expenses, early diagnosis and timely treatment are essential. The recent COVID-19 crisis has disrupted the care trajectory of cancer patients, which may affect their prognosis in a potentially negative way. The purpose of this paper is to present a flexible decision-analytic Markov model methodology allowing the evaluation of the impact of delayed cancer care caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium which can be used by researchers to respond to diverse research questions in a variety of disruptive events, contexts and settings. A decision-analytic Markov model was developed for 4 selected cancer types (i.e. breast, colorectal, lung, and head and neck), comparing the estimated costs and quality-adjusted life year losses between the pre-COVID-19 situation and the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium. Input parameters were derived from published studies (transition probabilities, utilities and indirect costs) and administrative databases (epidemiological data and direct medical costs). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses are proposed to consider uncertainty in the input parameters and to assess the robustness of the model's results. Scenario analyses are suggested to evaluate methodological and structural assumptions. The results that such decision-analytic Markov model can provide are of interest to decision makers because they help them to effectively allocate resources to improve the health outcomes of cancer patients and to reduce the costs of care for both patients and healthcare systems. Our study provides insights into methodological aspects of conducting a health economic evaluation of cancer care and COVID-19 including insights on cancer type selection, the elaboration of a Markov model, data inputs and analysis.",

The established gene pattern was correlated with tumor progression, clinical prognosis, and drug treatment efficacy. Biological analysis was performed using HNSCC patient sample data obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. All samples included in this study contained survival information. RNA sequencing data from 740 samples were used for the analysis. Previously characterized cell cycle-related genes were included for unsupervised consensus clustering. Two subtypes of HPV-negative HNSCCs (C1, C2) were identified. Subtype C1 displayed low cell cycle activity, 'hot' tumor microenvironment (TME), earlier N stage, lower pathological grade, better prognosis, and higher response rate to the immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Subtype C2 was associated with higher cell cycle activity, 'cold' TME, later N stage, higher pathological grade, worse prognosis, and lower response rate to the treatment. According to the nearest template prediction method, classification rules were established and verified.

Project DELTA aims to enable earlier detection and treatment through targeted screening using a novel risk prediction algorithm for oesophageal cancer (incorporating risk factors of Barrett's oesophagus including prescriptions for acid-reducing medications (CanPredict)), together with a non-invasive, low-cost sampling device (CytospongeTM). However, there are many barriers to implementation, and this paper identifies key ethical and legal challenges to implementing these personalised prevention strategies for Barrett's oesophagus/oesophageal cancer. To identify ethical and legal issues relevant to the deployment of a risk prediction tool for oesophageal cancer into primary care, we adopted an interdisciplinary approach, incorporating targeted informal literature reviews, interviews with expert collaborators, a multidisciplinary workshop and ethical and legal analysis. Successful implementation raises many issues including ensuring transparency and effective risk communication; addressing bias and inequity; managing resources appropriately and avoiding exceptionalism. Clinicians will need support and training to use cancer risk prediction algorithms, ensuring that they understand how risk algorithms supplement rather than replace medical decision-making. Workshop participants had concerns about liability for harms arising from risk algorithms, including from potential bias and inequitable implementation. Determining strategies for risk communication enabling transparency but avoiding exceptionalist approaches are a significant challenge. Future challenges include using artificial intelligence to bolster risk assessment, incorporating genomics into risk tools, and deployment by non-health professional users. However, these strategies could improve detection and outcomes. Novel pathways incorporating risk prediction algorithms hold considerable promise, especially when combined with low-cost sampling. However immediate priorities should be to develop risk communication strategies that take account of using validated risk algorithms, and to ensure equitable implementation. Resolving questions about liability for harms arising should be a longer-term objective.",

Further, to disclose any interaction between the TNM-response mode to NAC and stage-specific survival rates, i.e., whether survival for a particular pathological disease stage was dependent on whether this was reached through a downstaging or as stable disease following NAC. Retrospective study on radically resected patients \u2264 75\u2009years of age with gastric adenocarcinoma stages I-III diagnosed during 2001-2016.

Long-term survival rates were similar when specific ypTNM-stages were compared to their corresponding pTNM chemo-na\u00efve counterparts. The dichotomised N0 vs. N\u2009+\u2009had a substantial impact on the long-term survival rates in both groups, however, no discrepancy in long-term survival rates between pN0 vs. ypN0, and pN\u2009+\u2009vs. ypN\u2009+\u2009was found.

Despite appealing features of ONP marketing, participants surmised ads would appeal to youth, new users, tobacco users seeking to cut down/quit, or to \"high class,\" \"white-collar\" demographics. Participants' perceptions of ONPs and their marketing suggest ONPs are more likely to be used as situational versus complete substitutes for cigarettes and SLT.

        "AbstractText": "Photodynamic therapy based on fluorescence illumination of subcellular organelles and in situ bursts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been recognized as a promising strategy for cancer theranostics. However, the short life of ROS and unclarified anticancer mechanism seriously restrict the application. Herein, we rationally designed and facilely synthesized a 2,6-dimethylpyridine-based triphenylamine (TPA) derivative TPA-DMPy with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) features and production of type-I ROS. Except for its selective binding to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), TPA-DMPy, in synergy with glibenclamide, a medicinal agent used against diabetes, induced significant apoptosis of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, TPA-DMPy greatly incited the release of calcium from ER upon light irradiation to further aggravate the depolarization of ER membrane potential caused by glibenclamide, thus inducing fatal ER stress and crosstalk between ER and mitochondria. Our study extends the biological design and application of AIE luminogens and provides new insights into discovering novel anticancer targets and agents.",

        "AbstractText": "Most proteins are flexible molecules that coexist in an ensemble of several conformations. Point mutations in the amino acid sequence of a protein can trigger structural changes that drive the protein population to a conformation distinct from the native state. Here, we report a protein engineering approach to better understand protein dynamics and ligand binding of the FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), a prospective target for stress-related diseases, metabolic disorders, some types of cancers and chronic pain. By randomizing selected regions of its ligand-binding domain and sorting yeast display libraries expressing these variants, mutants with high affinity to conformation-specific FKBP51 selective ligands were identified. These improved mutants are valuable tools for the discovery of novel selective ligands that preferentially and specifically bind the FKBP51 active site in its open conformation state. Moreover, they will help us understand the conformational dynamics and ligand binding mechanics of the FKBP51 binding pocket.",

        "AbstractText": "Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have identified many putative susceptibility genes for colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. However, susceptibility miRNAs, critical dysregulators of gene expression, remain unexplored. We genotyped DNA samples from 313 CRC East Asian patients and performed small RNA sequencing in their normal colon tissues distant from tumors to build genetic models for predicting miRNA expression. We applied these models and data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) including 23\u2009942 cases and 217\u2009267 controls of East Asian ancestry to investigate associations of predicted miRNA expression with CRC risk. Perturbation experiments separately by promoting and inhibiting miRNAs expressions and further in vitro assays in both SW480 and HCT116 cells were conducted. At a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of P\u2009<\u20094.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4, we identified two putative susceptibility miRNAs, miR-1307-5p and miR-192-3p, located in regions more than 500\u00a0kb away from any GWAS-identified risk variants in CRC. We observed that a high predicted expression of miR-1307-5p was associated with increased CRC risk, while a low predicted expression of miR-192-3p was associated with increased CRC risk. Our experimental results further provide strong evidence of their susceptible roles by showing that miR-1307-5p and miR-192-3p play a regulatory role, respectively, in promoting and inhibiting CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, which was consistently observed in both SW480 and HCT116 cells.

        "AbstractText": "To compare the perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) with pelvic lymph-nodes dissection (PLND) when the same surgeon performs RARP and PLND versus one surgeon performs RARP and another surgeon performs PLND. From January 2022 to March 2023, data of consecutive patients who underwent RARP with PLND were prospectively collected. The surgeries were performed by two \"young\" surgeons with detailed profile. Specifically for the study purpose, one surgeon performed RARP, and the other surgeon performed PLND. A set of surgeries performed according to the standard setup (i.e., the same surgeon performing both RARP and PLND) was retrieved from the institutional database and used as comparator arm. To test the study hypothesis, patients were divided into two groups: \"dual-surgeon\" versus \"single-surgeon\". Fifty patients underwent RARP and PLND performed according to dual-surgeon setup and were compared to the last 50 procedures performed according to the standard single-surgeon setup. Patients in the groups had comparable baseline characteristics. Dual-surgeon interventions had significantly shorter median total operative (194 [IQR 178-215] versus 174 [IQR 146-195] minutes, p<0.001) and console time (173 [IQR 158-194] versus 154 [IQR 129-170] minutes, p<0.001). No significant differences were found in terms of blood loss, intraoperative complications, postoperative outcomes, and final pathology results. The present analysis found that when RARP and PLND are split onto two surgeons, the operative time is shorter by 20 minutes compared to when a single surgeon performs RARP and PLND. This is an interesting finding that could sponsor further studies.",

        "AbstractText": "Salvage robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (S-RARP) has gained prominence in recent years for treating patients with cancer recurrence following non-surgical treatments of Prostate Cancer. We conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate the role and outcomes of S-RARP over the past decade. A systematic review was conducted, encompassing articles published between January 1st, 2013, and June 1st, 2023, on S-RARP outcomes. Articles were screened according to PRISMA guidelines, resulting in 33 selected studies. Data were extracted, including patient demographics, operative times, complications, functional outcomes, and oncological outcomes. Among 1,630 patients from 33 studies, radiotherapy was the most common primary treatment (42%). Operative times ranged from 110 to 303 minutes, with estimated blood loss between 50 to 745 mL. Intraoperative complications occurred in 0 to 9% of cases, while postoperative complications ranged from 0 to 90% (Clavien 1-5). Continence rates varied (from 0 to 100%), and potency rates ranged from 0 to 66.7%. Positive surgical margins were reported up to 65.6%, and biochemical recurrence ranged from 0 to 57%. Salvage robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy in patients with cancer recurrence after previous prostate cancer treatment is safe and feasible. The literature is based on retrospective studies with inherent limitations describing low rates of intraoperative complications and small blood loss. However, potency and continence rates are largely reduced compared to the primary RARP series, despite the type of the primary treatment. Better-designed studies to assess the long-term outcomes and individually specify each primary therapy impact on the salvage treatment are still needed. Future articles should be more specific and provide more details regarding the previous therapies and S-RARP surgical techniques.",

        "AbstractText": "Background: Genomic profiling is increasingly used both in therapeutic decision-making and as inclusion criteria for trials testing targeted therapies. However, the mutational landscape may vary across different areas of a tumor and intratumor heterogeneity will challenge treatments or clinical decisions based on single tumor biopsies. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical relevance of genetic intratumor heterogeneity in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) using the ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of Molecular Targets (ESCAT).Materials and methods: This prospective study included 33 whole tumor specimens from 28 patients with primary or recurrent HNSCC referred for surgery. Three tumor blocks were selected from central, semi-peripheral, and peripheral positions, mimicking biopsies in three different locations. Genetic analysis of somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) was performed on the three biopsies using Oncoscan, focusing on 45 preselected HNSCC genes of interest. Clinical relevance was assessed using the ESCAT score to investigate whether and how treatment decisions would change based on the three biopsies from the same tumor.Results: The SCNAs identified among 45 preselected genes within the three tumor biopsies derived from the same tumor revealed distinct variations. The detected discrepancies could potentially influence treatment approaches or clinical decisions in 36% of the patients if only one tumor biopsy was used. Recurrent tumors exhibited significantly higher variation in SCNAs than primary tumors (p\u2009=\u2009.024). No significant correlation between tumor size and heterogeneity (p\u2009=\u2009.7) was observed.Conclusion: In 36% of patients diagnosed with HNSCC, clinically significant intratumor heterogeneity was observed which may have implications for patient management. This finding substantiates the need for future studies that specifically investigate the clinical implications associated with intratumor heterogeneity.",

Using a variety of research techniques, that is, enzyme-linked immunoassay, Western blot, biolayer interferometry, and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that our antibody detects all major NRP2 isoforms and does not cross-react with NRP1. Using this antibody, we show high NRP2 expression in granulomas from sarcoidosis patient skin and lung biopsies.

Methods: We conducted a survey among cancer survivors who were 15-39 years old and unmarried at the time of cancer diagnosis and 20-45 years old at the time of the survey. Views on fertility issues, originally developed based on the results of a qualitative study conducted with the same inclusion criteria, were used to assess thoughts and feelings regarding fertility issues. Results: Through exploratory factor analysis of the 128 respondents who either had children or desired children, two factors related to fertility issues were identified: \"anxiety related to the possibility of not being able to have children\" and \"pressure from others to have children.\" Multiple regression analysis was performed to examine the association between these factors and demographic characteristics. The analysis revealed that being male and having a partner were significant predictors for both factors for views on fertility issues. Additionally, younger age at the time of diagnosis was a significant predictor for the first factor. Conclusions: Greater fertility issues among unmarried cancer survivors were associated with younger age at diagnosis, having a partner, and being male. Surprisingly, contrary to previous findings, male cancer survivors experienced more significant fertility problems than women. This result may be attributed to the well-established gender roles in Japan, where men are predominantly considered the heirs and inheritors of the family.",

Fatigue is a common symptom experienced by cancer patients and it is often missed by health care professionals. Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) can assist in evaluating patient reported fatigue. This systematic review aims to determine if AYA cancer patients report more fatigue than AYAs who have not been diagnosed with cancer. We used a subset of articles from a larger review that searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO to determine which PROMs and domains are currently being used to evaluate AYA cancer. This study identified 175 articles related to PROMs in the AYA cancer population. Articles with PROMs reporting on fatigue/vitality were used in this review. From the original 175 articles, we identified 8 fatigue/vitality articles for this review. All eight articles found an increase in fatigue/decrease in vitality in the AYA cancer population compared to healthy controls. A meta-analysis was performed on four articles that used the same PROM tool (EORTC QLQ-C30). This found a statistically significant and clinically meaningful increase in mean fatigue of 12.5 95% confidence interval: 3.3-21.8 points (scale 0-100, higher number indicates more fatigue) in the AYA cancer group compared to healthy noncancer controls. Fatigue in the AYA cancer population is a significant issue, it is often undetected and underreported, and early interventions are needed to prevent the negative subsequent sequelae.",

Many publications have demonstrated that the disparities exist, the aim of this review is to identify actionable areas of improvement. To mitigate racial disparities, we must acknowledge that Black patients are at higher risk of high-risk subtypes of endometrial cancer, and their presentation can vary from what is considered typical for the most common type of endometrial cancer. We must address that practice recommendations for diagnosis may not be generalizable to all races and ethnicities, and that racism has an impact on how providers approach a work-up for Black vs. White patients. Finally, we must improve access to appropriate treatment by steadfastly adhering to recommended practice guidelines regardless of race/ethnicity and improving efforts to enroll a diverse patient population to clinical trials.

Although studies have documented lower cancer screening rates, there is limited epidemiological evidence quantifying potential diagnostic delays. This study explores the risk of metastatic cancer stage for people with IDD compared to those without IDD among breast (female), colorectal, and lung cancer patients in Canada. Separate population-based cross-sectional studies were conducted in Ontario and Manitoba by linking routinely collected data. Breast (female), colorectal, and lung cancer patients were included (Manitoba: 2004-2017; Ontario: 2007-2019). IDD status was identified using established administrative algorithms. Modified Poisson regression with robust error variance models estimated associations between IDD status and the likelihood of being diagnosed with metastatic cancer. Adjusted relative risks were pooled between provinces using random-effects meta-analyses. Potential effect modification was considered. The final cohorts included 115,456, 89,815, and 101,811 breast (female), colorectal, and lung cancer patients, respectively. Breast (female) and colorectal cancer patients with IDD were 1.60 and 1.44 times more likely to have metastatic cancer (stage IV) at diagnosis compared to those without IDD (relative risk [RR], 1.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-2.20; RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.24-1.67). This increased risk was not observed in lung cancer. Significant effect modification was not observed.

        "AbstractText": "TRPV1 is a nonselective Ca2+ channel protein that is widely expressed and plays an important role during the occurrence and development of many cancers. Activation of TRPV1 channels can affect tumour progression by regulating proliferation, apoptosis and migration. Some studies have also shown that activating TRPV1 can affect tumour progression by modulating tumour immunity. However, the effects of TRPV1 on the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not been explored clearly. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and spatial transcriptomics datasets from 10 \u00d7 Genomics were used to analyze TRPV1 expression in various tumour tissues. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined by cell counting kit 8 (CCK8), colony formation, and flow cytometry. Immunohistochemistry, qPCR, and western blotting were used to determine the mRNA and protein expression levels of TRPV1 and other related molecules. Tumour xenografts in BALB/C and C57BL/6J mice were used to determine the effects of TRPV1 on NSCLC development in vivo. Neurotransmitter content was examined by LC-MS/MS, ELISA and Immunohistochemistry. Immune cell infiltration was assessed by flow cytometry. In this study, we found that TRPV1 expression was significantly upregulated in NSCLC and that patients with high TRPV1 expression had a poor prognosis. TRPV1 knockdown can significantly inhibit NSCLC proliferation and induce cell apoptosis through Ca2+-IGF1R signaling. In addition, TRPV1 knockdown resulted in increased infiltration of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, GZMB+CD8+ T cells and DCs and decreased infiltration of immunosuppressive MDSCs in NSCLC. In addition, TRPV1 knockout effectively decreased the expression of M2 macrophage markers CD163 and increased the expression of M1-associated, costimulatory markers CD86. Knockdown or knockout of TRPV1 significantly inhibit tumour growth and promoted an antitumour immune response through supressing \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) secretion in NSCLC. Our study suggests that TRPV1 acts as a tumour promoter in NSCLC, mediating pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects on NSCLC through IGF1R signaling and regulating GABA release to affect the tumour immune response.",

Two BRCA-proficient BC cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and T47D BC, were used. Cell proliferation was assessed using the CCK-8 assay, and radiosensitivity was determined through the clonogenic survival assay. Flow cytometry was employed to analyze cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. The kinetics of DNA damage repair were evaluated using \u03b3H2AX immunofluorescence imaging and the comet assay. Tumor spheroid assays were conducted to test radiosensitivity in a three-dimensional culture condition. Olaparib sensitized both MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells to proton and X-ray irradiation in the clonogenic assay. MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited a higher dose enhancement factor for Olaparib than T47D cells. Olaparib increased radiation-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis specifically in MDA-MB-231 cells. \u03b3H2AX immunostaining and the comet assay showed Olaparib augmented radiation-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. The enhancement effect of Olaparib was more pronounced in proton irradiation than in X-ray irradiation, particularly in MDA-MB-231 cells than T47D cells. Both radiation and Olaparib dose-dependently inhibited spheroid growth in both cell lines. The synergy scores demonstrated that Olaparib interacted more strongly with protons than X-rays. The addition of an ATR inhibitor further enhanced Olaparib-induced proton radiosensitization in MDA-MB-231 cells. This study found that Olaparib enhanced radiation efficacy in BRCA-proficient breast cancer cells, with a more pronounced effect observed with proton irradiation compared to X-ray irradiation.

        "ArticleTitle": "The relationship between DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) and miR 124-3pa expressions in bladder cancer tissues.",
        "AbstractText": "Cancer bladder is the most common malignant tumor affecting the urinary tract. Genetic alterations are tightly associated with the development of cancer bladder. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small, noncoding single-stranded RNA molecules that have been linked to bladder cancer. miR-124-3pa exhibits altered expression in various types of human malignancies. DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) is responsible for de novo DNA methylation which is a fundamental epigenetic process in carcinogenesis. This work was performed to study the expression of DNMT3B and miR 124-3pa in bladder cancer tissues, and investigate their significance in the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. This case-control study included one hundred and six tissue samples of patients with primary urothelial bladder cancer. The tissues were separated into two parts. The first part was immediately frozen and kept at -\u200980\u00a0\u00b0C for total RNA extraction with subsequent detection of miR 124-3pa and DNMT3B expressions. The other part was preserved in formalin solution for histopathological examination. There was a highly statistically significant difference between the cancerous and the normal tissues as regarding miRNA-124-3pa and DNMT3B expression (P\u2009<\u20090.001) for each. Also, there was a highly statistically significant strong negative correlation between miRNA-124-3pa and DNMT3B expression (r=-0.750, P\u2009<\u20090.001). The combined performance of miR-124-3pa and DNMT3B revealed that the cutoff point of \u2265\u20093.3 can be used as a predictor of the presence of cancer bladder with sensitivity of 98.1% and specificity of 80%. miR-124-3pa and DNMT3B can be used as predictors of the presence of cancer bladder.",

        "AbstractText": "Single-target inhibitors have not been successful in cancer treatment due to the development of drug resistance. Nevertheless, therapeutic agents capable of simultaneously inhibiting multiple targets have revealed encouraging results in inducing apoptosis and overcoming drug resistance in cancerous cells. Here, we designed a composite liposomal nano-carrier co-loading 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to assess anticancer efficacy of the combined drugs in colorectal cancer (CRC). A PEGylated liposomal\u00a0nano-carrier with phospholipid/cholesterol/DSPE-PEG (2000) was synthesized by the thin film hydration technique for co-delivery of ATRA and 5-FU. After characterizing, the role of 5-FU and ATRA co-loaded liposomal nano-carrier in proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), apoptosis, and cancer stem cells (CSCs) were investigated by using colony forming and MTT assay, RT-qPCR and Annexin V/PI kit. The average size of liposomes (LPs) was\u2009<\u2009150 nm with uniform size distribution. Drug release analyses indicated that both ATRA and 5-FU could simultaneously release from LPs in a sustained release manner. The synergistic inhibitory effects of ATRA and 5-FU loaded in LPs were verified with a combination index of 0.43. Dual drug LPs showed the highest cytotoxicity, enhanced inhibition of cell proliferation, increased apoptotic potential, decreased CSCs, and attenuated EMT-associated biomarkers. Also, dual drug LPs decreased \u03b2-catenin gene expression more than other liposomal formulations. These findings suggest that using LPs to achieve a synergistic effect of ATRA and 5-FU is an effectual approach to increase the therapeutic effect of 5-FU toward CRC cells.",

This study designed to explore the associations between cardiac parameters and outcomes of myocarditis in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). Fourteen patients diagnosed with ICI-associated myocarditis by clinicians were admitted to the study analysis. By Cox univariate and multivariate survival analyses, potential risk factors for the development of severe myocarditis were identified. Survival analysis was also performed to explore the prognosis of patients with myocarditis. Among patients with myocarditis, higher B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels (P\u00a0= 0.04) and conduction block (P\u00a0= 0.03) were associated with progression to severe myocarditis. In addition, high lactate dehydrogenase (LHD) levels (P\u00a0= .04) and myocarditis onset within 2 months (P\u00a0= 0.02) were prognostic factors of severe myocarditis. The median progression-free survival (PFS) time and median overall survival (OS) time for all patients were 5.9 months and 18.5 months, respectively. However, there were no statistical differences between mild and severe cohorts in terms of PFS and OS (PFS: 4.5 vs. 8.5 months, P\u00a0= 0.17; OS: 21.3 vs. 18.5months, P\u00a0= 0.36).

        "AbstractText": "Regular mammogram screenings are effective for early breast cancer (BC) detection and decreased mortality rate. However, immigrant Muslim Arab women (IMAW) are less likely to adhere to these screenings although the rate of BC among IMAW is high. Recent studies have explored low mammogram screening rates among immigrant Muslim and/or Arab women from a limited perspective, overlooking the fact that husbands have an influence in IMAW's health behaviors toward cancer screenings. Thus, this mixed-method approaches were employed to (a) explore the association between spousal support and IMAW's health beliefs toward mammograms and their utilization, (b) to understand IMAW's experiences of spousal influence related to their mammogram use and health beliefs. The quantitative portion of the study, recruitment and data collection were conducted via online surveys in Arabic and English. Logistic regressions were used to explore relationships between perceived spousal support and IMAW's mammogram utilization and health beliefs. The qualitative portion of the study was conducted on a purposive sample of IMAW. A semi-structured interview guide in Arabic and English was used during one-on-one interviews. Arabic interviews were translated into English and transcribed by professionals. Interviews were analyzed by thematic analysis according to Braun and Clarke (2008). A total of 184 IMAW completed the survey with mean age of 50.4 (SD\u2009=\u20095.58, range\u2009=\u200945-60). Results revealed low mammogram screening rate among IMAW. Only 32.6% adhered to mammograms. Spousal support was positively associated with ever having obtained a mammogram and IMAW's adherence to mammogram. The 20 qualitative interviews, 16 in Arabic and four in English, produced rich description supporting results from the survey which includes, (a) types of spousal support, (b) impact of spousal support on participants' mammogram utilization and experience, and (3) impact of spousal support on participants' health beliefs toward mammograms. Findings from surveys and interviews show that a husband's support is positively associated with IMAW's mammogram utilization and health beliefs.

        "AbstractText": "Approximately 25% of the fine needle aspiration samples (FNAB) of thyroid nodules are classified as \"indeterminate samples\", that means, Bethesda III and IV categories. Until the last decade, most of these cases underwent diagnostic surgery, although only a minority (13-34%) confirmed malignancy postoperatively. In view of this, with the objective of improving the preoperative diagnosis in these cases, the molecular tests emerged, which are validated from the diagnostic point of view, presenting good performance, with good diagnostic accuracy, being able to avoid diagnostic surgeries. With the advancement of knowledge of the role of each of the mutations and gene rearrangements in thyroid oncogenesis, molecular markers have left to play only a diagnostic role and have been gaining more and more space both in defining the prognostic role of the tumor, as well as in the indication of target therapy. Thus, the objective of this review is to show how to use the tool of molecular tests, now commercially available in the world, in the management of indeterminate cytological nodules, assessing the pre-test malignancy risk of the nodule, through clinical, ultrasonographic and cytological characteristics, and decide on the benefit of molecular testing for each patient.

        "AbstractText": "Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), specifically the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-MAPK subfamily, play a crucial role in the development of various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the specific roles of JNK1/2 and their upstream regulators, MKK4/7, in HCC carcinogenesis remain unclear. In this study, we performed differential expression analysis of JNK-MAPK components at both the transcriptome and protein levels using TCGA and HPA databases. We utilized Kaplan-Meier survival plots and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate the prognostic performance of a risk scoring model based on these components in the TCGA-HCC cohort. Additionally, we conducted immunoblotting, apoptosis analysis with FACS and soft agar assays to investigate the response of JNK-MAPK pathway components to various death stimuli (TRAIL, TNF-\u03b1, anisomycin, and etoposide) in HCC cell lines. JNK1/2 and MKK7 levels were significantly upregulated in HCC samples compared to paracarcinoma tissues, whereas MKK4 was downregulated. ROC analyses suggested that JNK2 and MKK7 may serve as suitable diagnostic genes for HCC, and high JNK2 expression correlated with significantly poorer overall survival. Knockdown of JNK1 enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in hepatoma cells, while JNK2 knockdown reduced TNF-\u03b1/cycloheximide (CHX)-and anisomycin-induced apoptosis. Neither JNK1 nor JNK2 knockdown affected etoposide-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, MKK7 knockdown augmented TNF-\u03b1/CHX- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis and inhibited colony formation in hepatoma cells. Targeting MKK7, rather than JNK1/2 or MKK4, may be a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit the JNK-MAPK pathway in HCC therapy.",

While thyroid cancer mortality remains low, the risk of recurrence is a significant concern. Identifying individual patient recurrence risk is crucial for guiding subsequent management and follow-ups. In this prospective study, a cohort of 383 patients was observed for a minimum duration of 10 years within a 15-year timeframe. Thirteen clinicopathologic features were assessed to predict recurrence potential. Classic (K-nearest neighbors, support vector machines (SVM), tree-based models) and artificial neural networks (ANN) were trained on three distinct combinations of features: a data set with all features excluding American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk score (12 features), another with ATA risk alone, and a third with all features combined (13 features). 283 patients were allocated for the training process, and 100 patients were reserved for the validation of stage. The patients' mean age was 40.87\u2009\u00b1\u200915.13 years, with a majority being female (81%). When using the full data set for training, the models showed the following sensitivity, specificity and AUC, respectively: SVM (99.33%, 97.14%, 99.71), K-nearest neighbors (83%, 97.14%, 98.44), Decision Tree (87%, 100%, 99.35), Random Forest (99.66%, 94.28%, 99.38), ANN (96.6%, 95.71%, 99.64). Eliminating ATA risk data increased models specificity but decreased sensitivity. Conversely, training exclusively on ATA risk data had the opposite effect. Machine learning models, including classical and neural networks, efficiently stratify the risk of recurrence in patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer.

        "AbstractText": "Cancer survivors frequently experience cancer-related financial burdens. The extent to which Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Plus (LGBTQ+) populations experience cancer-related cost-coping behaviors such as crowdfunding is largely unknown, owing to a lack of sexual orientation and gender identity data collection and social stigma. Web-scraping has previously been used to evaluate inequities in online crowdfunding, but these methods alone do not adequately engage populations facing inequities. We describe the methodological process of integrating technology-based and community-engaged methods to explore the financial burden of cancer among LGBTQ+ individuals via online crowdfunding. To center the LGBTQ+ community, we followed community engagement guidelines by forming a study advisory board (SAB) of LGBTQ+ cancer survivors, caregivers, and professionals who were involved in every step of the research. SAB member engagement was tracked through quarterly SAB meeting attendance and an engagement survey. We then used web-scraping methods to extract a data set of online crowdfunding campaigns. The study team followed an integrated technology-based and community-engaged process to develop and refine term dictionaries for analyses. Term dictionaries were developed and refined in order to identify crowdfunding campaigns that were cancer- and LGBTQ+-related. Advisory board engagement was high according to metrics of meeting attendance, meeting participation, and anonymous board feedback. In collaboration with the SAB, the term dictionaries were iteratively edited and refined. The LGBTQ+ term dictionary was developed by the study team, while the cancer term dictionary was refined from an existing dictionary. The advisory board and analytic team members manually coded against the term dictionary and performed quality checks until high confidence in correct classification was achieved using pairwise agreement. Through each phase of manual coding and quality checks, the advisory board identified more misclassified campaigns than the analytic team alone. When refining the LGBTQ+ term dictionary, the analytic team identified 11.8% misclassification while the SAB identified 20.7% misclassification. Once each term dictionary was finalized, the LGBTQ+ term dictionary resulted in a 95% pairwise agreement, while the cancer term dictionary resulted in an 89.2% pairwise agreement. The classification tools developed by integrating community-engaged and technology-based methods were more accurate because of the equity-based approach of centering LGBTQ+ voices and their lived experiences. This exemplar suggests integrating community-engaged and technology-based methods to study inequities is highly feasible and has applications beyond LGBTQ+ financial burden research.",

This study aims to build and validate a CDSS for real-time endoscopy for all stages of gastric carcinogenesis, including atrophy and IM. A total of 11,868 endoscopic images were used for training and internal testing. The primary outcomes were lesion classification accuracy (6 classes: advanced gastric cancer, early gastric cancer, dysplasia, atrophy, IM, and normal) and atrophy and IM lesion segmentation rates for the segmentation model. The following tests were carried out to validate the performance of lesion classification accuracy: (1) external testing using 1282 images from another institution and (2) evaluation of the classification accuracy of atrophy and IM in real-world procedures in a prospective manner. To estimate the clinical utility, 2 experienced endoscopists were invited to perform a blind test with the same data set. A CDSS was constructed by combining the established 6-class lesion classification model and the preneoplastic lesion segmentation model with the previously established lesion detection model. The overall lesion classification accuracy (95% CI) was 90.3% (89%-91.6%) in the internal test. For the performance validation, the CDSS achieved 85.3% (83.4%-97.2%) overall accuracy. The per-class external test accuracies for atrophy and IM were 95.3% (92.6%-98%) and 89.3% (85.4%-93.2%), respectively.

        "ArticleTitle": "Modulation of EGFR Activity by Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Nanoparticles Targeting Intracellular Epitopes.",
        "AbstractText": "In recent years, molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticles (nanoMIPs) have proven to be an attractive alternative to antibodies in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. However, several key questions remain: how suitable are intracellular epitopes as targets for nanoMIP binding? And to what extent can protein function be modulated via targeting specific epitopes? To investigate this, three extracellular and three intracellular epitopes of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were used as templates for the synthesis of nanoMIPs which were then used to treat cancer cells with different expression levels of EGFR. It was observed that nanoMIPs imprinted with epitopes from the intracellular kinase domain and the extracellular ligand binding domain of EGFR caused cells to form large foci of EGFR sequestered away from the cell surface, caused a reduction in autophosphorylation, and demonstrated effects on cell viability. Collectively, this suggests that intracellular domain-targeting nanoMIPs can be a potential new tool for cancer therapy.",

        "AbstractText": "Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common human cancer. Although there are surgical and topical treatments available, surgery remains the mainstay of treatment, leading to higher costs. What is needed is an accurate risk assessment of BCC so that treatments can be planned in a patient-centered manner. In this study, we will review the literature about guidelines for the management of BCC and analyze the potential indicators of high-risk BCC. Using this risk assessment approach, we will propose pathways that will be able to optimize treatments more efficiently. This paper presents a perspective from a skin cancer expert and clinic involved in the treatment of both simple and complex cases of BCC. It addresses the key challenges associated with accurate risk stratification prior to any treatment or procedure. Different immunohistochemical and angiogenic markers for high-risk BCC were reviewed in this study. The expression of interleukin-6, vascular endothelial growth factor, and mast cells within BCC correlates with its aggressiveness. Other immunohistochemical markers, such as Cyclin D1 and Bcl-2, also play a significant role-Cyclin D1 is higher in the aggressive BCC, while Bcl-2 is lower in the aggressive BCC, compared to the nonaggressive variants. Based on our research, we will conclude that using immunohistochemical and angiogenic markers for risk assessment and stratification of BCC can help optimize treatment, ensuring that surgical procedures are used only when necessary.",

        "AbstractText": "Activation of the Wnt pathway lies at the core of many human cancers. Wnt and macropinocytosis are often active in the same processes, and understanding how Wnt signaling and membrane trafficking cooperate should improve our understanding of embryonic development and cancer. Here, we show that a macropinocytosis activator, the tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), enhances Wnt signaling. Experiments using the Xenopus embryo as an in vivo model showed marked cooperation between the PMA phorbol ester and Wnt signaling, which was blocked by inhibitors of macropinocytosis, Rac1 activity, and lysosome acidification. Human colorectal cancer tissue arrays and xenografts in mice showed a correlation of cancer progression with increased macropinocytosis/multivesicular body/lysosome markers and decreased GSK3 levels. The crosstalk between canonical Wnt, focal adhesions, lysosomes, and macropinocytosis suggests possible therapeutic targets for cancer progression in Wnt-driven cancers.",

Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and biological characterization of the first-in-class dual Sirt2/HDAC6 inhibitors as molecular tools for dual inhibition of tubulin deacetylation. Using biochemical in vitro assays and cell-based methods for target engagement, we identified Mz325 (33) as a potent and selective inhibitor of both target enzymes. Inhibition of both targets was further confirmed by X-ray crystal structures of Sirt2 and HDAC6 in complex with building blocks of 33. In ovarian cancer cells, 33 evoked enhanced effects on cell viability compared to single or combination treatment with the unconjugated Sirt2 and HDAC6 inhibitors. Thus, our dual Sirt2/HDAC6 inhibitors are important new tools to study the consequences and the therapeutic potential of dual inhibition of tubulin deacetylation.",

        "AbstractText": "The COVID-19 pandemic created challenges to the evaluation and treatment of cancer, and abrupt resource diversion toward patients with COVID-19 put cancer treatment on hold for many patients. Previous reports have shown substantial declines in cancer screening and diagnoses in 2020; however, the extent to which the delivery of cancer care was altered remains unclear. To assess alterations in cancer treatment in the US during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. This retrospective cohort study used data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) on patients older than 18 years with newly diagnosed cancer from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020. The main outcomes were accessibility (time to treatment, travel distance, and multi-institutional care), availability (proportional changes in cancer treatment between years), and utilization (reductions by treatment modality, hospital type) of cancer treatment in 2020 compared with 2018 to 2019. Autoregressive models forecasted expected findings for 2020 based on observations from prior years. Of 1\u202f229\u202f654 patients identified in the NCDB in 2020, 1\u202f074\u202f225 were treated for cancer, representing a 16.8% reduction from what was expected. Patients were predominately female (53.8%), with a median age of 66 years (IQR, 57-74 years), similar to demographics in 2018 and 2019. Median time between diagnosis and treatment was 26 days (IQR, 0-36 days) in 2020, and median travel distance for care was 11.1 miles (IQR, 5.0-25.3 miles), similar to 2018 and 2019. In 2020, fewer patients traveled longer distances (20.2% reduction of patients traveling >35 miles). The proportions of patients treated with chemotherapy (32.0%), radiation (29.5%), and surgery (57.1%) were similar to those in 2018 and 2019. Overall, 146\u202f805 fewer patients than expected underwent surgery, 80\u202f480 fewer received radiation, and 68\u202f014 fewer received chemotherapy. Academic hospitals experienced the greatest reduction in cancer surgery and treatment, with a decrease of approximately 484 patients (-19.0%) per hospital compared with 99 patients (-12.6%) at community hospitals and 110 patients (-12.8%) at integrated networks. This study found that among patients diagnosed with cancer in 2020, access and availability of treatment remained intact; however, reductions in treated patients varied across treatment modalities and were greater at academic hospitals than at community hospitals and integrated networks compared with expected values. These results suggest the resilience of cancer service lines and frame the economic losses from reductions in cancer treatment during the pandemic.",

To analyze the trend of overall survival after treatment failure for patients with rectal cancer within three consecutive phase 2 or 3 trials of the German Rectal Cancer Study Group. This cohort study is a post hoc analysis of 3 randomized phase 2 or 3 trials (CAO/ARO/AIO-94, -04, and -12 trials, conducted in Germany) that included 1948 patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma. The CAO/ARO/AIO-94 trial recruited patients between February 1995 and September 2002, the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 trial recruited patients between July 2006 and February 2010, and the CAO/ARO/AIO-12 trial recruited patients between June 2015 and January 2018. Statistical analysis was conducted between September 2022 and March 2023. A total of 119 of 391 patients in the CAO/ARO/AIO-94 trial group A, 295 of 1236 patients in the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 trial, and 69 of 306 in the CAO/ARO/AIO-12 trial experienced treatment failure (R2 resection or local recurrence or distant metastases) and were included in further analyses. Characteristics of treatment failure and overall survival were assessed in all 3 trial cohorts. Of the 1948 patients treated in the 3 trials, 15 were excluded because of missing data. Of the remaining 1933 patients (median age, 62.5 years [range, 19-84 years]; 1363 men [71%] and 570 women [29%]) with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma (cT3 or 4 or cN+) treated within 3 consecutive clinical trials, 483 experienced treatment failure and were analyzed. After a median follow-up of 36 months (IQR, 24-51 months) for all patients, overall survival after treatment failure was significantly improved in the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 trial (at 3 years, 44% [IQR, 37%-51%]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.61 [95% CI, 0.47-0.79]) and further improved in the CAO/ARO/AIO-12 trial (at 3 years, 73% [IQR, 60%-87%]; HR, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.18-0.54]) compared with the CAO/ARO/AIO-94 trial (at 3 years, 30% [IQR, 22%-39%]) (both P\u2009<\u2009.001). Distant metastasis was the main reason for treatment failure throughout a 5-year follow-up (range, 67%-87%), and the relative risk for treatment failure was highest in the first 18 months in all 3 trials. ypTNM stage was significantly associated with the risk and time interval to treatment failure. Improvement in overall survival after treatment failure was independent of sex. This cohort study suggests that advancements in salvage strategies during the past decades have likely improved overall survival among patients with rectal cancer who experienced treatment failure.",

Recently, light iris color and four specific single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified as a UM-risk factor. Furthermore, six iris color predicting SNPs have been discovered (IrisPlex). Interestingly, two of these (rs129138329 and rs12203592) are also UM-risk factors. We collected worldwide incidence data of OM and investigated its correlations with iris color, IrisPlex SNPs, and UM-risk SNPs. Cases of OM, as defined by the International Classification of Diseases Oncology C69 (eye), 8720/3 to 8790/3 (malignant melanoma), and 8000 to 8005 (malignant neoplasm), between 1988 and 2012, were extracted from the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents. Incidence rates were age-standardized and their trends were analyzed with joinpoint regression and age period cohort modeling. Frequencies for each country of iris color, IrisPlex SNPs, and UM-risk SNPs were collected from the literature. Incidence rates were generally \u22658.0 cases per million person-years in Northern Europe, Western Europe, and Oceania; 2.0 to 7.9 in North America, Eastern Europe, and Southern Europe; and <2.0 in South America, Asia, and Africa. OM incidence correlated with latitude (r = 0.77, P \u2264 0.001) and is expressed as a north-to-south decreasing gradient in Europe. SNP rs12913832 correlated with OM incidence (r = 0.83, P \u2264 0.001), blue iris color (r = 0.56, P \u2264 0.05), green iris color (r = 0.51, P \u2264 0.05), and brown iris color (r = -0.64, P \u2264 0.01). Trends were stable for most countries (28/35). OM incidence is highest in populations of European ancestry and lowest in populations of Asian and African ancestry. Overall, trends are stable, and the spatial correlation among OM incidence, iris color, and rs12913832 may support the role of pigmentation-related risk factors in OM development.",

To evaluate the effect of a personalized multilevel intervention on screening orders in older adults due for average-risk CRC screening. Interventional 2-group parallel unmasked cluster randomized clinical trial conducted from November 2015 to February 2019 at 2 US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities: 1 academic VA medical center and 1 of its connected outpatient clinics. Randomization at the primary care physician/clinician (PCP) level, stratified by study site and clinical full-time equivalency. Participants were 431 average-risk, screen-due US veterans aged 70 to 75 years attending a primary care visit. Data analysis was performed from August 2018 to August 2023. The intervention group received a multilevel intervention including a decision-aid booklet with detailed information on screening benefits and harms, personalized for each participant based on age, sex, prior screening, and comorbidity. The control group received a multilevel intervention including a screening informational booklet. All participants received PCP education and system-level modifications to support personalized screening. The primary outcome was whether screening was ordered within 2 weeks of clinic visit. Secondary outcomes were concordance between screening orders and screening benefit and screening utilization within 6 months. A total of 436 patients were consented, and 431 were analyzed across 67 PCPs. Patients had a mean (SD) age of 71.5 (1.7) years; 424 were male (98.4%); 374 were White (86.8%); 89 were college graduates (21.5%); and 351 (81.4%) had undergone prior screening. A total of 258 (59.9%) were randomized to intervention, and 173 (40.1%) to control. Screening orders were placed for 162 of 258 intervention patients (62.8%) vs 114 of 173 control patients (65.9%) (adjusted difference, -4.0 percentage points [pp]; 95% CI, -15.4 to 7.4 pp). In a prespecified interaction analysis, the proportion receiving orders was lower in the intervention group than in the control group for those in the lowest benefit quartile (59.4% vs 71.1%). In contrast, the proportion receiving orders was higher in the intervention group than in the control group for those in the highest benefit quartile (67.6% vs 52.2%) (interaction P\u2009=\u2009.049).

In this cluster randomized clinical trial, patients who were presented with personalized information about screening benefits and harms in the context of a multilevel intervention were more likely to receive screening orders concordant with benefit and were less likely to utilize screening.

Overarching issues were also described. In this commentary we review the current status of the evidence for the 20 priority agents identified in 2009. We examine whether identified Research Recommendations for each agent were addressed and their potential impact on resolving classification uncertainties. We reviewed the IARC classifications of each of the 20 priority agents and identified major new epidemiological and human mechanistic studies published since the last evaluation. Information sources were either the published Monograph for agents that have been reevaluated or, for agents not yet reevaluated, Advisory Group reports and literature searches. Findings are described in view of recent methodological developments in Monographs evidence evaluation processes. The majority of the 20 priority agents were reevaluated by IARC since 2009. The overall carcinogen classifications of 9 agents advanced, and new cancer sites with either \"sufficient\" or \"limited\" evidence of carcinogenicity were also identified for 9 agents. Examination of published findings revealed whether evidence gaps and Research Recommendations have been addressed and highlighted remaining uncertainties. During the past decade, new research addressed a range of the 2009 recommendations and supported updated classifications for priority agents. This supports future efforts to systematically apply findings of Monograph reviews to identify research gaps and priorities relevant to evaluation criteria established in the updated IARC Monograph Preamble. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12547.",

This study examined the ability of duloxetine to prevent signs of chronic OIPN in female (n = 12) and male (n = 21) rats treated with the chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin.

These new discoveries have revealed that complement manipulation can be considered a new strategy for cancer therapies. Here we summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms by which the different elements of the complement system exert antitumor or protumor functions, both in preclinical studies and in human tumorigenesis.

As it stands, cancer cell death-induced changes in the tumor microenvironment that contribute to antitumor or protumor effects remain largely unknown. This is complicated to examine because cell death is often subverted by tumors to circumvent natural, and therapy-induced, immunosurveillance. Here, we provide insights into important but understudied aspects of assessing the contribution of cell death to tumor elimination or cancer progression, including the role of tumor-associated genetics, epigenetics, and oncogenic factors in subverting immunogenic cell death.

T cell-dependent bispecific antibodies (TDBs) function as conditional agonists that induce a polyclonal T-cell response, resulting in target cell destruction and cytokine release. The relationship between this response and its effects on surrounding innate immune populations has not been fully explored. Here we show that treatment with mosunetuzumab in patients results in natural killer (NK) cell activation in the peripheral blood. We modeled this phenomenon in vitro and found that TDB-mediated killing activated NK cells, increasing natural killing function and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and enhanced the capability of macrophages to perform antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). This enhancement was triggered by cytokines released through TDB treatment, with IL2 and IFN\u03b3 being major drivers for increased ADCC and ADCP, respectively. Surprisingly, cytolytic ability could be further augmented through neutralization of IL10 for NK cells and TNF\u03b1 for macrophages. Finally, we showed that TDB treatment enhanced the efficacy of Fc-driven killing to an orthogonal solid tumor target in vivo.

        "AbstractText": "De novo sequencing of oligonucleotides remains challenging, especially for oligonucleotides with post-transcriptional or synthetic modifications. Mass spectrometry (MS) sequencing can reliably detect and locate all of the modification sites in oligonucleotides via m/z variance. However, current MS-based sequencing methods exhibit complex spectra and low ion abundance and usually require coupled instrumentation. Herein, we demonstrate a method of oligonucleotide sequencing using TiO2/ZnAl-layered double oxide (LDO)-assisted laser desorption/ionization (LDI)-MS based on radical-induced dissociation (RID). \u00b7CH2OH radicals can be produced on the surface of a TiO2/ZnAl-LDO matrix via ultraviolet light, inducing an attack on the active site of the oligonucleotide phosphate skeleton to create typical \"a-, a-B-, c\u00b7-, d-, w-, and y\"-type fragments. Compared with the spectra obtained via collision-based methods, such as collision-induced dissociation and higher-energy collisional dissociation, the LDI-MS spectra based on RID exhibit single-charged signals, fewer types of fragments, and a lower proportion of unknown noise peaks. We demonstrate full sequence coverage for a 6-mer 2'-O-methyl-modified oligonucleotide and a 21-mer small interfering RNA and show that RID can sequence oligonucleotides with modifications. Importantly, the mechanism responsible for the RID of the oligonucleotide phosphate skeleton was investigated through offline experiments, demonstrating consistent results with density functional theory calculations.",

It has the high merits of noninvasiveness and limited drug resistance. To fully utilize this therapy, an extraordinary nanovehicle is required to target phototherapeutic agents in the tumor cells. Nanovesicles embody an ideal strategy for drug delivery applications. Cell membrane-derived biomimetic nanovesicles represent a developing type of nanocarrier. Combining this technique with cancer phototherapy could enable a novel strategy. Herein, efforts are made to describe a comprehensive overview of cell membrane-derived biomimetic nanovesicles for cancer phototherapy. The description in this review is mainly based on representative examples of exosome-derived biomimetic nanomedicine research, ranging from their comparison with traditional nanocarriers to extensive applications in cancer phototherapy. Additionally, the challenges and future prospectives for translating these for clinical application are discussed.",

        "AbstractText": "How cell metabolism regulates DNA repair is incompletely understood. Here, we define a GTP-mediated signaling cascade that links metabolism to DNA repair and has significant therapeutic implications. GTP, but not other nucleotides, regulates the activity of Rac1, a guanine nucleotide-binding protein, that promotes the dephosphorylation of serine 323 on Abl-interactor 1 (Abi-1) by protein phosphatase 5 (PP5). Dephosphorylated Abi-1, a protein previously not known to activate DNA repair, promotes non-homologous end joining. In patients and mouse models of glioblastoma, Rac1 and dephosphorylated Abi-1 mediate DNA repair and resistance to standard of care genotoxic treatments. The GTP-Rac1-PP5-Abi-1 signaling axis is not limited to brain cancer, as GTP supplementation promotes DNA repair and Abi-1-S323 dephosphorylation in non-malignant cells and protects mouse tissues from genotoxic insult. This unexpected ability of GTP to regulate DNA repair independently of deoxynucleotide pools has important implications for normal physiology and cancer treatment.",

The use of various and mostly unconscious defense mechanisms is implemented to cope with increased suffering after a cancer diagnosis. In this preliminary report, we explored the presence of defense mechanisms and their associations with psychopathological dimensions in a sample of late-stage cancer patients without history of psychiatric disorders. We recruited 50 patients (28 females, 18-64 years old) with cancer diagnosis without prior history of any substance use disorder or psychiatric disorders. All participants were given the following self-report questionnaires: the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) and the 40-item version of the Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40). In our study we demonstrated significant psychiatric distress in a third of our patients (defined as SCL-90 \u22652 points). A Pearson correlation analysis on all patients shows that psychotic defense styles were correlated with hostility, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, somatization, interpersonal sensitivity, and psychoticism, while neurotic defense styles correlated with somatization. Our results are in line with previous findings showing that one third of cancer patients suffers from a psychiatric disorder. Moreover, we found that somatization correlates with both psychotic and neurotic defense mechanism styles.

Using a mouse model, we investigated the mechanism by which cholesterol exacerbates MASH and the effect of colestyramine (a bile acid adsorption resin) and elobixibat (an apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter inhibitor) concomitant administration on bile acid adsorption and MASH status. Mice were fed a high-fat high-fructose diet with varying concentrations of cholesterol to determine changes in fatty liver according to liver status, water intake, defecation status, insulin resistance, bile acid levels, intestinal permeability, atherosclerosis (in apolipoprotein E knockout mice), and carcinogenesis (in diethylnitrosamine mice). Using small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA), we evaluated the effect of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) knockdown on triglyceride synthesis and fatty liver status following the administration of elobixibat (group E), colestyramine (group C), or both (group EC). We found greater reductions in serum alanine aminotransferase levels, serum lipid parameters, serum primary bile acid concentrations, hepatic lipid levels, and fibrosis area in EC group than in the monotherapy groups. Increased intestinal permeability and watery diarrhea caused by elobixibat were completely ameliorated in group EC. Group EC showed reduced plaque formation rates in the entire aorta and aortic valve of the atherosclerosis model, and reduced tumor counts and tumor burden in the carcinogenesis model. Excessive free cholesterol in the liver can promote fatty liver disease. Herein, combination therapy with EC effectively reduced free cholesterol levels in MASH model mice.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of children (\u226418\u00a0years) with nonmetastatic extremity primary osteosarcoma at King Hussein Cancer Center from January 2005 until March 2020. Patients' demographics, disease characteristics, and outcomes were collected. Events were defined as death, progression, or relapse. Cox proportional hazards regression was used for univariable and multivariable comparisons of different covariates. Eighty-two patients were included; 41 (50%) were females; the median age was 12.5\u00a0years (range: 5.9-18). Sixty-four patients (78%) underwent LC by limb-salvage surgery. Fifteen patients (18%) had a delay of LC greater than or equal to 18\u00a0weeks. After a median follow-up of 54\u00a0months (range: 8-188), the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 55.3% \u00b1 5.8% and 66.6% \u00b1 6%, respectively. On univariable analysis, LC greater than or equal to 18\u00a0weeks, progression before LC, amputation, and poor histologic response were associated with worse EFS (p\u00a0=\u00a0.007, .007, .006, .002) and OS (p\u00a0=\u00a0.01, .001, .006, .004).

        "AbstractText": "Mycosis fungoides and S\u00e9zary syndrome are rare and largely incurable types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with limited therapeutic options. In 1984 Bunn et al. reported that interferon alpha is an efficient monotherapy in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and 14 years later it was shown in a prospective, randomized trial that a combination of interferon alpha and psoralen plus ultraviolet A therapy (PUVA) is most efficient in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Since then interferon alpha as single agent or, most often, in combination with phototherapy and/or retinoids has been integrated as standard of care in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma guidelines worldwide. However, production of interferon alpha was discontinued recently worldwide and pegylated interferon alpha-2a (PEG-IFN\u03b1) has been used as an alternative therapy. In contrast to numerous interferon alpha studies, only a few studies focusing on PEG-IFN\u03b1 are available. Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct a retrospective data collection to report on the efficacy, adverse events and therapy regimens of PEG-IFN\u03b1 in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In 28 patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treated in Germany and in the Netherlands, 36% of patients achieved complete remission, 36% partial remission and 29% stable disease. Eighteen percent of patients developed adverse events during therapy, which led to the discontinuation of PEG-IFN\u03b1 therapy in 2 patients. The most common concomittant therapies were oral PUVA phototherapy and local radiotherapy. In conclusion, PEG-IFN\u03b1, especially in combination with skin-directed therapies, is an effective treatment option for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in clinical practice.",

It remains uncertain to what extent breast cancer in Africa is reminiscent of breast cancer in African American or European American patients. Here, we performed whole exome sequencing of genomic DNA from 191 breast tumor and non-cancerous adjacent tissue pairs obtained from 97 African American, 69 European American, 2 Asian American, and 23 Kenyan patients. Our analysis of the sequencing data revealed an elevated tumor mutational burden in both Kenyan and African American patients, when compared to European American patients. TP53 mutations were most prevalent, particularly in African American patients, followed by PIK3CA mutations, which showed similar frequencies in European American, African American, and the Kenyan patients. Mutations targeting TBX3 were confined to European Americans and those targeting the FBXW7 tumor suppressor to African American patients whereas mutations in the ARID1A gene that are known to confer resistance to endocrine therapy were distinctively enriched among Kenyan patients. A KEGG pathway analysis could link FBXW7 mutations to an increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity in tumors carrying these mutations. Lastly, COSMIC mutational signatures in tumors correlated with the occurrence of driver mutations, immune cell profiles, and neighborhood deprivation with associations ranging from being mostly modest to occasionally robust. To conclude, we found mutational profiles that were different between these patient groups. The differences concentrated among genes with low mutation frequencies in breast cancer.",

In a translational effort covering genomic and biochemical approaches, combined with in vivo validation experiments and a phase I clinical trial, they demonstrate that upon DNA damage, XPO1 selectively exports transcripts encoding proteins involved in genome maintenance via the RNA-binding proteins THOC4 and eIF4E. Pharmacologic interception of this export process enhances chemosensitivity in various lymphoma models, and combined selinexor plus chemoimmunotherapy displays a favorable toxicity profile and early evidence of efficacy in patients.",

Thus, it is of paramount importance to identify biomarkers and clinical profiles predictive of treatment response and to find novel therapeutic targets. The use of immune checkpoint blockade showed more favorable outcomes in patients with extrahepatic disease and normal levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase in a panel of retrospective studies, making its use more reasonable in this subgroup. To identify novel drug targets, we will analyze the expression and relevance of neural crest transcription factors in patient bio-specimens using next-generation nanopore sequencing. Computer algorithms and network-based analysis will facilitate the identification of druggable targets which will subsequently be validated in patient-derived short-term cell cultures.

Digestion conditions need to be optimized to maximize cell yield without sacrificing quality. This is particularly challenging in the context of solid tumors with dense desmoplastic matrices that must be gently broken down for cell release. Freshly isolated cells from solid tumor tissue are more fragile than those isolated from cell lines. Additionally, as the cell types isolated are heterogeneous, conditions should be selected to support the total cell population. Finally, nuclear isolation conditions must be optimized based on these qualities in terms of lysis times and reagent types/ratios.

It extracts the 3D contour of the lung using medical image processing technology against the background of the entire lung and performs 3D reconstruction of the lung, pulmonary artery, and multiple pulmonary nodules in 3D space.

The SCCM and IDSA convened a taskforce to update the 2008 version of the guideline for the evaluation of new fever in critically ill adult patients, which included expert clinicians as well as methodologists from the Guidelines in Intensive Care, Development and Evaluation Group. The guidelines committee consisted of 12 experts in critical care, infectious diseases, clinical microbiology, organ transplantation, public health, clinical research, and health policy and administration. All task force members followed all conflict-of-interest procedures as documented in the American College of Critical Care Medicine/SCCM Standard Operating Procedures Manual and the IDSA. There was no industry input or funding to produce this guideline. We conducted a systematic review for each population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes question to identify the best available evidence, statistically summarized the evidence, and then assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used the evidence-to-decision framework to formulate recommendations as strong or weak or as best-practice statements. The panel issued 12 recommendations and 9 best practice statements. The panel recommended using central temperature monitoring methods, including thermistors for pulmonary artery catheters, bladder catheters, or esophageal balloon thermistors when these devices are in place or accurate temperature measurements are critical for diagnosis and management. For patients without these devices in place, oral or rectal temperatures over other temperature measurement methods that are less reliable such as axillary or tympanic membrane temperatures, noninvasive temporal artery thermometers, or chemical dot thermometers were recommended. Imaging studies including ultrasonography were recommended in addition to microbiological evaluation using rapid diagnostic testing strategies. Biomarkers were recommended to assist in guiding the discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy. All recommendations issued were weak based on the quality of data. The guidelines panel was able to formulate several recommendations for the evaluation of new fever in a critically ill adult patient, acknowledging that most recommendations were based on weak evidence. This highlights the need for the rapid advancement of research in all aspects of this issue-including better noninvasive methods to measure core body temperature, the use of diagnostic imaging, advances in microbiology including molecular testing, and the use of biomarkers.",

Several variables that place patients at high risk of VCF have previously been identified, including advanced Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS), a widely adopted clinical decision criterion to assess spinal instability. We examine the role of tumoral endplate (EP) disruption in the risk of VCF and attempt to incorporate it into a simple risk stratification system. This study was a retrospective cohort study from a single institution. Demographic and treatment information was collected for patients who received spinal SBRT between 2013 and 2019. EP disruption was noted on pre-SBRT computed tomography scan. The primary end point of 1-year cumulative incidence of VCF was assessed on follow-up MRI and computed tomography scans at 3-month intervals after treatment. A total of 111 patients were included. The median follow-up was 18 months. Approximately 48 patients (43%) had at least one EP disruption. Twenty patients (18%) experienced a VCF at a median of 5.2 months from SBRT. Patients with at least one EP disruption were more likely to experience VCF than those with no EP disruption (29% vs 6%, P < .001). A nomogram was created using the variables of EP disruption, a SINS of \u22657, and adverse histology. Patients were stratified into groups at low and high risk of VCF, which were associated with 2% and 38% risk of VCF (P < .001). EP disruption is a novel risk factor for VCF in patients who will undergo spinal SBRT. A simple nomogram incorporating EP disruption, adverse histology, and SINS score is effective for quickly assessing risk of VCF. These data require validation in prospective studies and could be helpful in counseling patients regarding VCF risk and referring for prophylactic interventions in high-risk populations.",

CTC enumeration is vital in determining patient disease since CTCs are rare and heterogeneous. CTCs are detached from the primary tumor, enter the blood circulation system, and potentially grow at distant sites, thus metastasizing the tumor. Since CTCs carry similar information to the primary tumor, CTC isolation and subsequent characterization can be critical in monitoring and diagnosing cancer. The enumeration, affinity modification, and clinical immunofluorescence staining of rare CTCs are powerful methods for CTC isolation because they provide the necessary elements with high sensitivity. Microfluidic chips offer a liquid biopsy method that is free of any pain for the patients.

        "AbstractText": "Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is a common malignant tumor in the head and neck, the 5-year relative survival rate of patients diagnosed with laryngeal cancer was estimated to be 61% from 2012 to 2018. An increasing number of studies have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a key role in the occurrence and development of cancer and may function as cancer biomarkers and new therapeutic targets. At present, the research on the relationship between circRNAs and LSCC is still in its infancy and needs further exploration. In this study, we found a circRNA (hsa_circ_0001445) associated with LSCC based on bioinformatics analysis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay indicated that the expression of hsa_circ_0001445 was down-regulated in LSCC tissues and cell lines. Notably, the expression of hsa_circ_0001445 was negatively correlated with aggressive clinicopathological features and poor prognosis. Then, functional experiments found that overexpression of hsa_circ_0001445 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of LSCC cells and tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), biotin-labeled probe pull-down, luciferase reporter assay and western blot experiments were employed and found that EIF4A3 reduced the expression of hsa_circ_0001445, and the direct binding of hsa_circ_0001445 to hsa-miR-432-5p attenuated the inhibitory effect of hsa-miR-432-5p on RGMA. In summary, our research suggests that hsa_circ_0001445 may be used as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for LSCC.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Evaluation of Raman spectroscopy combined with the gated recurrent unit serum detection method in early screening of gastrointestinal cancer.",
        "AbstractText": "Gastric and colorectal cancers are significant causes of human mortality. Conventionally, the diagnosis of gastrointestinal tumors has been accomplished through image-based techniques, including endoscopic and biopsy procedures coupled with tissue staining. Most of these methods are invasive. In contrast, Raman spectroscopy has the advantages of being non-invasive and label-free and requiring no additional reagents, making it a potential tool for the detection of serum components. In this study, we collected Raman spectra of serum samples from patients with gastric cancer (n = 93) and colorectal cancer (n = 92) and from healthy individuals (n = 100). Analysis of Raman peak areas revealed that cancer patients had significantly higher peak areas at around 2923 cm-1 compared to normal individuals, which corresponded to the presence of lipids and proteins. We successfully achieved the early screening of gastrointestinal tumors using the improved gated recurrent unit (GRU) algorithm and traditional machine learning methods. The accuracy of identifying digestive tract tumors using different recognition models exceeds 84.72%, with support vector machine (SVM) and GRU achieving 100% accuracy. The use of GRU further demonstrated its ability to differentiate subtypes of gastric and colorectal cancers based on the degree of differentiation and stage, with a recognition accuracy exceeding 95%, which is challenging using traditional machine learning methods. Furthermore, our study revealed that principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction has a limited impact on the recognition results obtained using different recognition models.",

        "AbstractText": "Immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs) such as thalidomide, pomalidomide, and lenalidomide are the most common cereblon (CRBN) recruiters in proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) design. However, these CRBN ligands induce the degradation of IMiD neosubstrates and are inherently unstable, degrading hydrolytically under moderate conditions. In this work, we simultaneously optimized physiochemical properties, stability, on-target affinity, and off-target neosubstrate modulation features to develop novel nonphthalimide CRBN binders. These efforts led to the discovery of conformationally locked benzamide-type derivatives that replicate the interactions of the natural CRBN degron, exhibit enhanced chemical stability, and display a favorable selectivity profile in terms of neosubstrate recruitment. The utility of the most potent ligands was demonstrated by their transformation into potent degraders of BRD4 and HDAC6 that outperform previously described reference PROTACs. Together with their significantly decreased neomorphic ligase activity on IKZF1/3 and SALL4, these ligands provide opportunities for the design of highly selective and potent chemically inert proximity-inducing compounds.",

        "AbstractText": "The nitric oxide (NO\u2022)/soluble guanylate cyclase/cyclic-GMP (cGMP) signaling pathway is ubiquitous and regulates several functions in physiological systems as diverse as the vascular, nervous, and renal systems. However, its roles in determining normal and abnormal lower urinary tract functions are unclear. The aim was to identify potential therapeutic targets associated with this pathway to manage lower urinary tract functional disorders. This review summarizes a workshop held under the auspices of ICI-RS with a view to address these questions. Four areas were addressed: NO\u2022 signaling to regulate neurotransmitter release to detrusor smooth muscle; its potential dual roles in alleviating and exacerbating inflammatory pathways; its ability to act as an antifibrotic mediator; and the control by nitrergic nerves of lower urinary tract vascular dynamics and the contractile performance of muscular regions of the bladder wall. Central to much of the discussion was the role of the NO\u2022 receptor, soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) in regulating the generation of the enzyme product, the second messenger cGMP. The redox state of sGC is crucial in determining its enzymic activity and the role of a class of novel agents, sGC activators, to optimize activity and to potentially alleviate the consequences of lower urinary tract disorders was highlighted. In addition, the consequences of a functional relationship between nitrergic and sympathetic nerves to regulate vascular dynamics was discussed. Several potential NO\u2022-dependent drug targets in the lower urinary tract were identified that provide the basis for future research and translation to clinical trials.",

We estimated the causal effects of circulating cytokines on RCC risk in males and females with several Mendelian randomization methods. We observed a significant causal effect of Eotaxin on the increased risk of RCC in males (Odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20092.546, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20091.617-4.010, p value\u2009=\u20095.496\u2009\u00d7\u200910-5), but not in females (OR\u2009=\u20091.352, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.766-2.388, p value\u2009=\u20090.298). Besides, we also identified several cytokines as potentially associated with RCC in males including RANTES, MCP3, PDGFbb, TRAIL, and several other cytokines as potentially associated with RCC in females including sICAM and SCGFb.

We conducted a nested case-control study of prediagnostic serum levels of 19 PFAS and papillary thyroid cancer (400 cases, 400 controls) in the Finnish Maternity Cohort (pregnancies 1986-2010; follow-up through 2016), individually matched on sample year and age. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for log2 transformed and categorical exposures, overall and stratified by calendar period, birth cohort, and median age at diagnosis. We adjusted for other PFAS with Spearman correlation rho\u2009=\u20090.3-0.6. Seven PFAS, including perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), N-ethyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid (EtFOSAA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) were detected in >50% of women. These PFAS were not associated with risk of thyroid cancer, except for PFHxS, which was inversely associated (OR log2 \u2009=\u20090.82, 95% CI: 0.70-0.97). We observed suggestive but imprecise increased risks associated with PFOA, PFOS, and EtFOSAA for those diagnosed at ages <40\u2009years, whereas associations were null or inverse among those diagnosed at 40+ years (P-interaction: .02, .08, .13, respectively). There was little evidence of other interactions. These results show no clear association between PFAS and papillary thyroid cancer risk.

However, the effect of neuropsychiatric conditions on long-term adolescent and young adult cancer (AYAC) survivors has not been formally investigated. Thus, the impact and management of late neuropsychiatric complications in AYAC survivors compared to non-cancer-matched controls (NCMC) in the US were evaluated using the All of Us (AoU) Research Program. Participants in the AoU Controlled Tier Dataset (v6) diagnosed with cancer between ages 15 and 39 were identified from electronic health records and surveys. AYAC survivors were matched with NCMC using the optimal pair-matching algorithm at a 1:4 ratio. Data on past diagnoses, current follow-up care, and treatment patterns of neuropsychiatric complications were collected. Analysis was performed on 788 AYAC survivors and 3152 NCMC. AYAC survivors, with an average of 8.8\u2009years since their first cancer diagnosis, were more likely than NCMC to receive a diagnosis of neuropathy, memory loss and epilepsy (p \u2009<\u20090.001).

Therefore, we aimed to identify and quantify (potential) barriers and facilitators in TDM-guided dosing for imatinib, sunitinib, and pazopanib. We performed a mixed methods study among all stakeholders involved: patients, healthcare professionals (HCPs), pharmaceutical companies, and health insurance companies. During the first qualitative part of this study, we performed semi-structured individual interviews and one focus group interview to identify all (potential) barriers and facilitators, and during the second quantitative part of this study, we used a web-based survey to quantify these findings.

The history and evolution of MM staging are revisited, including its role in predicting survival, treatment planning and potential practical implications for the future. The role of MM staging for oncological practice and patient counseling is discussed. The utility of the traditional MM staging remains unsatisfactory because it lacks a strong connection with the disease biology, prognosis or treatment planning. Additionally, it demonstrates a modest value for patient counseling because individual prognosis is subject to under- or overestimation, and the median survival or survival rates are difficult concepts to grasp. Although the role of MM stages may change in the future, the current research upholds the notion that MM staging benefits more medical research and clinical trials than oncological practice.",

Spearman correlation analysis was used to examine the correlations between quality-of-life scores and postoperative clinical parameters. Spearman correlation analysis showed that postoperative BMI, late complications and catheter-free state were significantly associated with postoperative global QoL and symptom scale in MSSCU and postoperative global QoL and physical scale in IC patients.

We included randomized controlled trials (RCT), nonrandomized trials, cohort studies (CS), and controlled before-after studies of EPC in adult patients in English, Dutch, and German language. Interventions had to be self-labeled as EPC. Screening and data extraction were performed by two raters. A structured analysis incorporating the TIDieR checklist was performed to describe the elements of the interventions. We screened 2651 articles, resulting in 40 articles being included: 34 studies were RCT and six studies were CS with a mean sample size of 208 patients. Patients with pancreatic (n\u2009=\u200910) and lung cancer (n\u2009=\u20099) were most often included. Studies reported different reference points for the onset of EPC such as time after diagnosis of incurable cancer (n\u2009=\u200918) or prognosis (n\u2009=\u20099). Thirteen studies provided information about elements of EPC and eight studies about the control intervention. Most frequent elements of EPC were symptom management (n\u2009=\u200928), case management (n\u2009=\u200916), and advance care planning (ACP; n\u2009=\u200915). Most frequently reported outcome measures were health-related quality of life (n\u2009=\u200926), symptom intensity (n\u2009=\u20096), resource use, and the patient's mood (n\u2009=\u20094 each). The elicited heterogeneity of ECP in combination with deficits of reporting are considerable barriers that should be addressed to further develop effective EPC interventions for different groups of cancer patients.",

        "AbstractText": "This study analyzed the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on radiotherapy delivery in Japan using a high-quality Japanese national database based on universal health coverage. We performed a retrospective observational study using National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan open data focused on radiotherapy between fiscal year (FY) 2019 and FY2020 and the number of COVID-19 cases from the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare. We statistically analyzed the relationship between the number of COVID-19 cases and the number of radiotherapy deliveries in Japan as a whole and by prefecture. The total number of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) fractions was 4,472,140 in FY2019 and 4,227,673 in FY2020 (-5.8%). EBRT courses were 250,395 in FY2019 and 240,329 in FY2020 (-4.0%), stereotactic radiotherapy courses were 27,619 in FY2019 and 31,786 in FY2020 (+15.1%), and single-fraction palliative radiotherapy courses were 4124 in FY2019 and 5255 in FY2020 (+21.5%). The total number of breast and prostate hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) fractions was 155,773 and 48,188 in FY2019, and 200,256 and 84,230 in FY2020 (+28.6% and +74.8%), respectively. In the Pearson correlation analysis, EBRT fractions were lower, and breast HFRT fractions were higher in prefectures with more COVID-19 cases. Overall, radiotherapy delivery in Japan was relatively stable after the pandemic, with an increase in HFRT. Also, EBRT fractions decreased, and breast HFRT were more likely to be used in prefectures with more COVID-19 cases.",

        "AbstractText": "3,5-diCQA has been shown to have anti-tumor effect by decreasing cancer cell growth. However, the molecular mechanism by which 3,5-diCQA impacts colorectal cancer (CRC) cells is unknown. This study discovered that 3,5-diCQA had a suppressive effect on CRC cells, mainly in the inhibition of proliferation, migration, and the enhancement of apoptosis in HCT116 and SW480 cells. Additionally, 3,5-diCQA was found to cause cell cycle arrest in CRC cells. Meanwhile, we found that 3,5-diCQA activates the AMPK pathway through the generation of ROS, mediates mitochondrial damage, and reduces mitochondrial aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation levels. 3,5-diCQA promoted oxidative damage and ferroptosis in CRC cells. Hence, we added ROS inhibitor NAC and found that the NAC reversed the effects of 3,5-diCQA on proliferation, apoptosis, ROS generation, and ferroptosis in CRC cells. Moreover, 3,5-diCQA was also shown to suppress the development of CRC tumor in a tumor-forming model of nude mice. In conclusion, we found that 3,5-diCQA enhances the oxidative damage and ferroptosis while reducing proliferation and migration of CRC cells, depending on mitochondrial dysfunction caused by the ROS/AMPK/mTOR pathway.",

Identification of individuals within the AYA populace that are at greatest risk of anthracycline-induced skeletal muscle loss is unknown. Moreover, investigations which seek out underlying causes of skeletal muscle degradation during chemotherapy are critical for understanding, preventing, and reducing chronic health conditions associated with poor skeletal muscle status. Computed tomography (CT) scans were used to investigate changes in skeletal muscle of 153 AYA sarcoma and Hodgkin lymphoma patients at thoracic vertebra 4 after anthracycline treatment. Images were examined at three time points during the first year of treatment. In parallel, we used translational juvenile mouse models to assess the impact of doxorubicin (DOX) in the soleus and gastrocnemius on muscle wasting. Significant reductions in total skeletal muscle index and density were seen after chemotherapy in AYA cancer patients (p\u2009<\u20090.01 & p\u2009=\u20090.04, respectively). The severity of skeletal muscle loss varied by subgroup (i.e., cancer type, sex, and treatment). Murine models demonstrated a reduction in skeletal muscle fiber cross-sectional area, increased apoptosis and collagen volume for both the soleus and gastrocnemius after DOX treatment (all p\u2009<\u20090.05). After DOX, hindlimb skeletal muscle blood flow was significantly reduced (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Significant skeletal muscle loss is experienced early during treatment in AYA cancer patients. Reductions in skeletal muscle blood flow may be a key contributing factor to anthracycline doxorubicin induced skeletal muscle loss.",

        "AbstractText": "Comorbidities and symptoms in metastatic breast cancer patients impact treatment decisions and influence prognosis and quality of life. The objective of this study is to examine the concordance between physician documentation and patient reports of comorbidities and symptoms to understand their comparative effectiveness. New patients with metastatic breast cancer completed an electronic intake survey assessing patient health history and symptoms. Physician documentation across 54 comorbidities and 42 symptoms was abstracted from notes for the corresponding clinic visits between November 2016 and March 2020. Concordance between patient reports and medical records for each condition and hazards ratios for each patient versus physician reported comorbidity and symptom were assessed. A total of 168 patients were included in the analysis (age, median\u2009=\u200956\u2009years, range\u2009=\u200929-86\u2009years; 131 white [78.9%]). Twenty-three of 54 comorbidities had a moderate to high level of agreement between patients and physicians (\u03ba\u2009\u2265\u20090.40). Physicians documented higher numbers of comorbidities that can be objectively measured which also had higher concordance (e.g., diabetes [\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.83] and hypertension [\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.79]) while patients reported higher numbers of comorbidities that are more subjective which also had lower concordance (anxiety [\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.30], GERD [\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.36]). One physician-documented and two patient-reported comorbidities were significantly associated with survival (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Only 2 of 42 symptoms had a moderate to high level of agreement between patients and physicians. One physician-documented and nine patient-reported symptoms were significantly associated with decreased survival (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Agreement between patients' and physicians' reporting of comorbidities varies substantially, and patient reports can complement physician documentation. Physicians significantly underreported symptoms versus patients; thus, concordance was also low. Multiple patient-reported symptoms were predictive of survival; thus, incorporating them can provide more informative estimates of predicted survival.",

We detected ENAH-202 expression in OSCC tissues and cell lines by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The biological function of ENAH-202 was assessed in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo using CCK-8, colony formation assays, transwell assays, xenograft formation, and tail vein injection. The further molecular mechanism by which ENAH-202 promoted OSCC progression was identified using RNA pull-down, LS-MS/MS analysis, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. ENAH-202 was significantly upregulated in OSCC tissues and cells. ENAH-202 promoted OSCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. The expression of enabled homolog (ENAH) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins was changed with the expression of ENAH-202. Moreover, ENAH-202 promoted the transcription of Vimentin (VIM) by binding with ZNF502, which can help ENAH-202 promote OSCC progression.

        "AbstractText": "Identifying cytogenetic changes in tumors can aid in diagnosis/prognosis and disease management. Complete cytogenetic characterization has historically required a multimethod/time-consuming approach. Optical genome mapping (OGM) offers a potential solution to this challenge by detecting both balanced and unbalanced abnormalities in a single assay. Genetic changes acquired with tumor-forming potential in a prostate xenograft subline [M2205] (derived from a Black male) that were detected using cytogenetic versus OGM analyses were compared to assess the utility of OGM for analyzing solid tumors. Cytogenetic/OGM concordance was noted for (a) copy number gains (16, 1p, 3q, 5q, 7p, 8q, 9q, 11p, 11q,\u00a015q, 20q), (b) copy number losses (Y, 3p, 4p, 6p, 7p, 9p, 11q), and (c) structural changes, including multibreak rearrangements. Discordance was noted for two structural findings, both of which had breakpoints localized to repetitive sequences. The OGM studies identified new findings and confirmed/further characterized 8q24 structural abnormalities. It also detected genes gained/disrupted in the 8q24 region (e.g., MYC, DEPTOR, and EXT1); but recognizing a jumping translocation required cytogenetic analyses. These results support using OGM as a tool to analyze solid tumors in clinical/research settings. Moreover, this OGM analysis expanded the characterization of cytogenetic changes present in the M2205 subline, including alterations associated with tumors from Black males diagnosed with prostate cancer.",

In retinal organoids generated from these iPSCs, the GNAT2-EGFP alleles robustly and exclusively labeled both immature and mature cones. Episodic confocal live imaging of hydrogel immobilized retinal organoids allowed tracking of morphological maturation of individual cones for >18 weeks and revealed inner segment accumulation of mitochondria and growth at 12.2 cubic microns per day from day 126 to day 153.

This study aims to characterize the variability in EOCRC incidence and discern both heterogeneous and homogeneous risk factors associated with synchronous liver, lung, and hepato-lung metastases. This study included patients with EOCRC enrolled in the SEER database between 2010 and 2015 and divided patients into three groups by synchronous liver, lung, and hepato-lung metastases. Each group of patients with different metastasis types was randomly assigned to the development and validation cohort in a ratio of 7:3. Logistic regression was used to analyze the heterogeneous and homogenous risk factors for synchronous liver, lung, and hepato-lung metastases in the development cohort of patients. Nomograms were built to calculate the risk of metastasis, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration curve were used to quantitatively evaluate their performance. A total of 16,336 eligible patients with EOCRC were included in this study, of which 17.90% (2924/16,336) had distant metastases. The overall incidences of synchronous liver, lung, and hepato-lung metastases were 11.90% (1921/16,146), 2.42% (390/16,126), and 1.50% (241/16,108), respectively. Positive CEA values before treatment, increased lymphatic metastases, and deeper invasion of intestinal wall were positively correlated with three distant types of metastases. On the contrary, the correlation of age, ethnicity, location of primary tumor, and histologic grade among the three types was inconsistent. The ROC curve and calibration curve proved to have fine performance in predicting distant metastases of EOCRC. There are significant differences in the incidence of distant metastases in EOCRC, and related risk factors are heterogeneous and homogenous.

CRF is a multi-factorial condition affected by several interrelated protective and perpetuating factors. As most studies merely assessed bivariate associations, more insight into the complex relationships among these constructs is needed. We applied the multivariate network approach to gain a better understanding of how patients' fatigue, perpetuating and protective factors are dynamically interconnected. Between February and August 2022, 30 cancer patients filled out a carefully developed ecological momentary assessment questionnaire (EnergyInSight) five times a day for at least 21\u00a0days while being on the waitlist for psychological care for CRF. We performed a multi-level vector autoregression analysis to examine the interconnectedness among fatigue, protective factors (allowing rest, acceptance, and self-efficacy) and perpetuating factors (worrying, catastrophizing, and feeling guilty). In the contemporaneous network (concurrent associations), higher acceptance and self-efficacy were associated with lower fatigue, whereas all other factors were associated with higher fatigue. The strongest relationships were between worrying and feeling guilty and between acceptance and allowing rest. In the temporal network (lagged associations), fatigue was related to two factors: higher self-efficacy preceded lower fatigue, and higher fatigue preceded increased allowing rest. Taking all included factors into account, the networks identified self-efficacy and allowing rest as key protective factors of CRF. Patients may benefit from psychological interventions that cultivate self-efficacy, as it seems to pave the way to reduced fatigue.",

Clinicopathological and peri-ORC therapeutic data were extracted from clinical records. We explored predictive factors that significantly affected the primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) and secondary endpoints of cancer-specific survival (CSS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). During a median follow-up of 3.9\u2009years, 42 (20.6%) and 10 (4.9%) patients died due to bladder cancer and other causes, respectively. Five-year RFS, CSS, and OS were 66.5%, 77.6%, and 75.4%, respectively. Pathological T and N categories and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) significantly affected RFS by Cox regression analysis. Accordingly, clinical T and pathological N categories and LVI significantly affected CSS. Clinical T and pathological N categories, LVI, age, and ORC tumor grade significantly affected OS. Based on the assessment score for each independent risk factor, we developed the Gunma University Oncology Study Group (GUOSG) score, which predicts RFS, CSS, and OS. The GUOSG score classified four groups for RFS, three for CSS, and five for OS, with statistically significant distribution for nearly all comparisons.

However, the evidence demonstrated that percutaneous ethanol injection was worse than radiofrequency ablation for overall survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.45, 95% credible interval [CrI]: 1.16-1.82), progression-free survival (HR: 1.36, 95% CrI: 1.11-1.67), overall recurrence (relative risk [RR]: 1.19, 95% CrI: 1.02-1.39) and local recurrence (RR: 1.80, 95% CrI: 1.19-2.71). The threshold analysis suggested that robust evidence was lacking for some comparisons. It is unclear which treatment is most effective for patients with small HCC because of limitations in the evidence base. It is also not known how these treatments would impact on quality of life. Further high quality RCTs are needed to provide robust evidence but may be difficult to undertake.",

        "AbstractText": "Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1 or YKL40) is a secreted glycoprotein highly expressed in advanced stages of several cancer types, including prostate cancer (PCa). Impacts of genetic variants of CHI3L1 on PCa development have not yet been investigated. The most common well-studied genetic variations are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore associations of CHI3L1 SNPs with both the susceptibility to PCa and its clinicopathological development. Three promoter SNPs, rs6691378 (-1371, G>A), rs10399805 (-247, G>A) and rs4950928 (-131, C>G), and one non-synonymous SNP, rs880633 (+2950, T>C), were analysed using a TaqMan allelic discrimination assay for genotyping in a cohort of 701 PCa patients and 701 healthy controls. Results indicated that there were no significant associations of PCa susceptibility with these four CHI3L1 SNPs. However, among elderly PCa patients (aged >65\u2009years), it was observed that polymorphic variants (GA\u2009+\u2009AA) of CHI3L1 rs6691378 and 10399805 were significantly linked to reduced risks of several clinicopathological characteristics, including a high Gleason grade, advanced pathologic T stage and tumour cell invasion. Moreover, analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas database revealed that CHI3L1 expression levels were elevated in PCa tissues compared with normal tissues. Interestingly, higher CHI3L1 expression levels were found to be associated with longer progression-free survival rates in PCa patients. Our findings indicated that levels of CHI3L1 may influence the progression of PCa, and the rs6691378 and 10399805 SNP genetic variants of CHI3L1 are linked to the clinicopathological development of PCa within a Taiwanese population.",

        "AbstractText": "Accurate preoperative and intraoperative identification and complete resection of bladder cancer is essential. Adequate postoperative follow-up and observation are important to identify early intravesical recurrence or progression. However, the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment is dependent on the knowledge and experience of the physicians. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be an important tool for physicians performing cystoscopies. Reports published over the past year and a half have identified an adequate amount of cystoscopy datasets for deep learning, with rich datasets of multiple tumour types including images of flat, carcinoma-in-situ, and elevated lesions, and more diverse applications. In addition to detecting bladder tumours, AI can assist in diagnosing interstitial cystitis. Applications of AI using conventional white-light and also to bladder endoscopy with different image enhancement techniques and manufacturers is underway. A framework has also been proposed to standardise the management of clinical data from cystoscopy to aid education and AI development and to compare with gastrointestinal endoscopic AI. Although real-world clinical applications have lagged, technological developments are progressing. AI-based cystoscopy is likely to become an important tool and is expected to have real-world clinical applications comprehensively linking AI and imaging, data management systems, and clinicians. http://links.lww.com/COU/A45.",

        "AbstractText": "To explore the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of breast cancer survivors. We utilized a qualitative descriptive approach to facilitate interviews among 25 participants, all of whom are survivors of breast cancer and have received treatment in Hong Kong within the preceding 3\u2009years. Content analysis was performed to understand how patients' HRQoL views and experiences changed during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The results included six themes delineating the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: (i) survivor sensitivities in pandemic times, (ii) coping and conditioning in pandemic times, (iii) transforming work and home dynamics in pandemic times, (iv) cognitive resilience and adaptation to the COVID-19 protective measures, (v) social resilience in pandemic times and (vi) healthcare adaptation and coping in pandemic times. This study provides insights into the experiences and challenges of breast cancer survivors during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Some survivors had new physical and psychological symptoms, including fear and anxiety, isolation, pain, lymphoedema and burnout, which potentially have long-term impact upon HRQoL. This study highlights the unique challenges faced by breast cancer survivors during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, including accessing healthcare services and the impact of social isolation. Healthcare providers should consider the holistic needs of breast cancer survivors in the provision of health care and develop supportive interventions, including telehealth services and online support groups, to address these challenges and improve their HRQoL. Surgery aimed at treating breast cancer or reducing its risk generally influences the appearance of breast areas and donor sites. The continuing effects of these changes on body image and HRQoL are well-reported, although studies have ineffectively examined the initial experiences of women regarding their postoperative appearance, particularly during the pandemic. The checklist of consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) was utilized. A small selection on breast cancer survivors contributed to the design of this study, in particular the content of the semi-structured interviews.",

        "AbstractText": "Men's illness vulnerabilities and resilience are two predominant and regularly linked constructs in the masculinities and men's health literature. There has been a steady stream of men's strength-based vulnerabilities in the form of illness testimonials amid critiques that such disclosures are mere props for bolstering patriarchal power. The current article presents secondary analyses of case studies with four participants who took part in wide-ranging qualitative health studies to detail diverse connections between masculinities and men's illness vulnerabilities and resilience. Prostate cancer-related vulnerabilities feature in the first case study where Arthur's resilience for reclaiming his erectile function post-prostatectomy mobilizes an objection masculinity contesting his marginality. In the second case study, Chuck's vulnerabilities are conceded as permanent flowing from his severe mental illness, a positionality situating resilience as obligatory for his survival. Here, Chuck embodies a resignate masculinity that accepts but works to manage the harms of his subordinate status. In the aftermath of his young son's suicide, Jack laments that he did not model vulnerabilities. Resilience for understanding his loss influences a reimagined masculinity where Jack contemplates changes to gender norms for his and other men's lives. Lastly, Sami replaces maladaptive actions for dousing vulnerabilities incurred through a partner-initiated separation with resilience for self-growth. Aspiring progress masculinity, Sami deconstructs his emotions and behaviors to positively change how he shows up as a man, father, and partner. The case studies reveal connections between objection, resignate, reimagined, and progress masculinities and men's illness vulnerabilities and resilience to advance empirical, gender theory and methodological insights.",

An ATR inhibitor, BAY 1895344, was evaluated for its use in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) therapy. BAY 1895344 inhibited cell viability in four DTC cell lines (TPC1, K1, FTC-133, and FTC-238) in a dose-dependent manner. BAY 1895344 treatment arrested DTC cells in the G2/M phase, increased caspase-3 activity, and caused apoptosis. BAY 1895344 in combination with either sorafenib or lenvatinib showed mainly synergistic effects in four DTC cell lines. The combination of BAY 1895344 with dabrafenib plus trametinib revealed synergistic effects in K1 cells that harbor BRAFV600E. BAY 1895344 monotherapy retarded the growth of K1 and FTC-133 tumors in xenograft models. The combinations of BAY 1895344 plus lenvatinib and BAY 1895344 with dabrafenib plus trametinib were more effective than any single therapy in a K1 xenograft model.

        "AbstractText": "Metformin has demonstrated antitumor potential in clinical studies; however, achieving optimal antitumor effects requires administering an extremely safe medication dose. To enhance the efficacy and reduce dosage requirements, we propose the creation of large-molecule drugs through the combination of small-molecule drugs. In this study, we developed novel polymer dots, referred to as MA-dots, with sizes of approximately 5 nm, featuring dual targeting capabilities for tumor cell membranes and mitochondria. MA-dots were synthesized using metformin and L-arginine via a rapid microwave-assisted method. Notably, the resulting MA-dots (with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 93.60 \u03bcg mL-1) exhibited more than a 12-fold increase in antitumor activity compared to the raw metformin material (IC50 = 1159.00 \u03bcg mL-1) over a 24-hour period. In addition, our MA-dots outperformed most metformin-derived nanodrugs in terms of antitumor efficacy. Furthermore, oral gavage treatment with MA-dots led to the suppression of A549 (lung cancer cell lines) tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistic investigations revealed that MA-dots bound to the large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) proteins, which are overexpressed in malignant tumor cell membranes. Moreover, these MA-dots accumulated within the mitochondria, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial damage, and disruption of energy metabolism by modulating the 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in tumor cells. This cascade of events triggers cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. In summary, this study presented a rapid method for fabricating a novel nanoderivative, MA-dots, capable of both tumor targeting and exerting tumor-suppressive effects.",

A retrospective case-control study of head and neck patients who underwent free flap reconstructive surgery at a single institution between January 2009 and December 2021 was conducted. Patient risk factors for postoperative urinary retention (POUR) were analyzed. Fisher Exact and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were used to evaluate rates of foley replacement, straight catheterization, and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) and associated risk factors. Two hundred and eleven patients were included in this study. Older age, lower BMI, lower intraoperative fluid volumes, and need for straight catheterization were statistically significant for POUR requiring foley replacement. Shorter total (P\u2009=\u2009.04) and postoperative (P\u2009=\u2009.01) foley duration showed statistical significance for POUR requiring straight catheterization. About 60% of patients who had straight catheterization required a foley replacement (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Only one patient (0.5%) developed a urinary tract infection (UTI). Foley catheter duration impacts the risk of POUR requiring straight catheterization and subsequently, foley replacement. Optimal timing for foley catheter removal in the postoperative period remains to be elucidated. Removal of catheters between 21 and 48\u2009hours after surgery may decrease the risk of POUR without increasing the rate of CAUTI in patients with head and neck pathology undergoing free flap reconstructive surgery.",

PGLs at extra-adrenal locations usually do not express phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), the enzyme required for epinephrine production, which was explained by the absence of glucocorticoids. PGLs with pathogenic variants (PVs) in Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (HRAS) can occur in or outside of the adrenal, but always synthesize epinephrine independently of the localization. Here, we characterize the signaling pathways through which PVs in HRAS influence PNMT expression. Catecholamines, cortisol, and transcriptional features of PGL tissues with known genetic background were analyzed. Genetically modified rat pheochromocytoma cells carrying PVs in Hras were generated and analyzed for regulation of Pnmt expression. Elevated epinephrine contents in PGLs with PVs in HRAS were accompanied by enrichment in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling compared to PGLs with PVs in genes that activate hypoxia pathways. In vitro, Hras PVs increased Pnmt expression and epinephrine biosynthesis through increased phosphorylation of stimulatory protein 1 via MAPK signaling.

However, the function and molecular mechanism of APOC3 in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) have not been reported. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot assays were used to detect the expression of APOC3 in KGN cells. Small interference APOC3 (siAPOC3) was applied to reduce APOC3 expression, and the proliferation ability of human granulosa cell line (KGN cells) was measured by cell counting kit-8 and colony formation assays. The protein levels of key genes related to apoptosis were detected by western blot assay. The transcriptional regulator of APOC3 was predicted by the UCSC and PROMO website, and verified by dual luciferase assay. siAPOC3 and pcDNA3.1-specific protein 1 (SP1) vector were co-transfected into KGN cells to detect the function of SP1 and APOC3 in KGN cells. APOC3 was overexpressed in KGN cells, and siAPOC3 transfection significantly reduced the growth ability of KGN cells and increased the apoptosis ability of KGN cells. SP1 directly bound to the promoter of APOC3 and transcriptional regulated APOC3 expression. Overexpression of SP1 increased the growth ability of KGN cells and decreased the apoptosis ability of KGN cells, which were reversed after siAPOC3 transfection.

        "AbstractText": "Mitophagy is a specific type of autophagy and a selective form of autophagy on a larger scale. It selectively eliminates damaged, misfolded, and surplus mitochondria, particularly those that are cytotoxic, by using autophagic lysosomes. This process is crucial for maintaining a balance of both the quality and quantity of mitochondria, which is necessary for normal cell function and tissue development. However, in certain abnormal situations, such as nutritional deficiencies and hypoxia, the function of mitophagy becomes impaired. This leads to a failure to clear damaged mitochondria in a timely manner, resulting in the production of a large number of reactive oxygen species. These reactive oxygen species further contribute to an inflammatory response and the release of factors that induce apoptosis. Moreover, abnormal mitophagy can also cause mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupt metabolic reprogramming during stress responses, alter cell fate decisions and differentiation, and consequently impact the development and progression of diseases, including cancer. Therefore, mitophagy plays a crucial role in controlling the quality of cancer cells, making it imperative to study its function and impact. Numerous proteins and molecules are involved in the regulation of mitophagy, with Parkin and PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) serving as key mediators, and the hypoxia-related proteins hypoxia-inducible factor la (HIF1a) and FUN14 domain-containing 1 (FUNDC1) also playing a role. Additionally, proteins such as chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 (CDT-1), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), caveolin 1 (Cav-1), and others contribute to the regulation of mitophagy in various ways. This article aims to explore the dual role of mitophagy in tumourigenesis by examining the factors and proteins associated with mitophagy and their regulatory effects.

Moreover, the available treatment options for HypoPT have changed. This position statement of the Expert Group of the Polish Society of Endocrinology summarizes the current state of knowledge and provides recommendations for optimal management to assist clinicians in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of HypoPT in Poland. The specific aspects of HypoPT management in children, pregnant and lactating women, and patients with chronic kidney disease are also discussed. HypoPT is a rare disorder characterized by hypocalcemia and the lack or deficiency of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Hypoparathyroidism can be associated with complications, including nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, renal insufficiency, cataract, seizures, cardiac arrhythmia, depression, and an increased risk of infection. Minimizing complications of HypoPT requires careful evaluation and close monitoring of laboratory parameters. Conventional management of HypoPT has focused on maintaining serum calcium levels using oral calcium and active vitamin D. However, this approach is limited because it does not restore normal PTH function, is often associated with inadequate biochemical control, and raises concerns as to long-term side effects. HypoPT is the only classic endocrine insufficiency that is not commonly treated with the substitution of the missing hormone. Recently, recombinant human PTH(1-84) has become available, offering hope that the use of the missing hormone in the treatment of HypoPT will help achieve better control and reduce the risk of complications.

In this study, we utilized an in silico-designed GR activity signature to demonstrate that GR relates to the proliferative capacity of numerous primary cancer types. In breast cancer, the GR activity status determines luminal subtype identity and has implications for patient outcomes. We reveal that GR engages with estrogen receptor (ER), leading to redistribution of ER on the chromatin. Notably, GR activation leads to upregulation of the ZBTB16 gene, encoding for a transcriptional repressor, which controls growth in ER-positive breast cancer and associates with prognosis in luminal A patients. In relation to ZBTB16's repressive nature, GR activation leads to epigenetic remodeling and loss of histone acetylation at sites proximal to cancer-driving genes. Based on these findings, epigenetic inhibitors reduce viability of ER-positive breast cancer cells that display absence of GR activity. Our findings provide insights into how GR controls ER-positive breast cancer growth and may have implications for patients' prognostication and provide novel therapeutic candidates for breast cancer treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "The development and progression of cancer cachexia are connected to systemic inflammation and physical performance. However, few relevant studies have reported the survival outcomes prediction of systemic inflammation and physical performance in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) cachexia. This study investigated the prognostic prediction value of systemic inflammation and performance status in patients with CRC cachexia. This multicentre cohort study prospectively collected 905 patients with CRC (58.3% males, 59.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.5\u00a0years old). Cancer cachexia was diagnosed according to the 2011 Fearon Cachexia Diagnostic Consensus. The prognostic value of systematic inflammatory indicators was determined using the area under the curve, concordance index, and multivariate survival analysis. Performance status was evaluated with Eastern Coopertive Oncology Group performance score (ECOG-PS). Survival data were analysed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The area under the curve, concordance index and survival analysis showed that C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocyte to CRP ratio (LCR) and CRP to albumin ratio (CAR) were more stable and consistent with the survival of patients with CRC, both in non-cachexia and cachexia populations. Among patients with CRC cachexia, high inflammation [low LCR, hazard ratio (HR) 95% confidence interval (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a03.33 (2.08-5.32); high CAR, HR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a02.92 (1.88-4.55); high CRP, HR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a03.12 (2.08-4.67)] indicated a worse prognosis, compared with non-cachexia patients [low LCR, HR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a02.28 (1.65-3.16); high CAR, HR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a02.36 (1.71-3.25); high CRP, HR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a02.58 (1.85-3.60)]. Similarly, among patients with CRC cachexia, high PS [ECOG-PS 2, HR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.61 (1.04-2.50); ECOG-PS 3/4, HR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a02.91 (1.69-5.00]) indicated a worse prognosis, compared with patients with CRC without cachexia [ECOG-PS 2, HR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.28 (0.90-1.81); ECOG-PS 3/4, HR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a02.41 (1.32-4.39]). Patients with CRC cachexia with an ECOG-PS score of 2 or 3-4 and a high inflammation had a shorter median survival time, compared with patients with an ECOG-PS score of 0/1 and a low inflammation. The systemic inflammatory markers LCR, CAR and CRP have stable prognostic values in patients with CRC. The ECOG-PS may be an independent risk factor for CRC. Combined evaluation of systemic inflammation and ECOG-PS in patients with CRC cachexia could provide a simple survival prediction.",

A systematic search was performed in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases up to December 2022, and the results were reviewed by 2 independent investigators. Studies reporting CMR diagnosis were included in a meta-analysis, and pooled measures were obtained. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tools from the National Institutes of Health. A total of 2,321 results was obtained; 10 studies were eligible, including one identified by citation search. Eight studies were included in the meta-analysis, which presented a pooled sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 94%, a diagnostic odds ratio of 185, and an area under the curve of 0.98 for CMR diagnosis of benign vs. malignant tumours. Additionally, 4 studies evaluated whether CMR diagnosis of cardiac tumours matched specific histopathological subtypes, with 73.6% achieving the correct diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published systematic review on CMR diagnosis of cardiac tumours. Compared to histopathological results, the ability to discriminate benign from malignant tumours was good but not outstanding.

However, little is known about their effects on glioma or the related underlying mechanisms. The study investigated the underlying mechanism of CP in treating glioma. The U251 and TG905 cells were treated with an ethanol extract from CP. Cell proliferation was detected using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and a colony formation assay. The flow cytometric analysis was applied to explore the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The expression levels of cell cycleand apoptosis-associated proteins were measured with western blot. A network pharmacology method was performed to predict the potential mechanism underlying the effects of the active components of CP on glioma. Then, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics analysis was used to verify the differentially expressed proteins and pathways in order to reveal the underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, to determine the iTRAQ results, 6 candidate proteins were chosen for quantification using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). The CP extract inhibited the proliferation of U251 and TG905 cells and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. There are 16 active compounds of CP. The antitumor mechanism of CP may be related to the apoptosis pathway, p53 signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT pathway, or transcriptional misregulation in cancer pathway. Six proteins (HSP90AB1, TOP2A, ATP1A1, TGF\u03b21, ATP1B1, and TYMS) were determined to be key factors involved in regulating CP in glioma.

Herein, an effective molecular design paradigm of anion-\u03c0+ interaction combined with the inherently crowded conformation that could enhance fluorescence efficacy and reactive oxygen species generation was proposed through a concise synthetic method. Mechanistically, upon photosensitization, the Hippo signaling pathway contributes to the death of melanoma cells and promotes the nuclear location of its downstream factor, yes-associated protein, which regulates the transcription and expression of apoptosis-related genes.

We obtained hourly concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), respirable particulate matter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO) from the China National Environmental Monitoring Center. We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study among 86\u2005635 emergency hospital admissions for stroke across 10 hospitals in 3 cities (Jinhua, Hangzhou, and Zhoushan) in Zhejiang province, China, between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2021. Using a conditional logistic regression combined with a distributed lag linear model, we estimated the association between hourly exposure to multiple air pollutants and risk of emergency hospital admissions for total stroke, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and undetermined type. Hourly exposure to PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2 was associated with an increased risk of hospital admissions for total stroke and ischemic stroke. The associations were most pronounced during the concurrent hour of exposure and lasted for \u22482 hours. We found that the risk was more pronounced among male patients or those aged <65 years old. Our findings suggest that exposure to PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2, but not CO and O3, is associated with emergency hospital admissions for total stroke or ischemic stroke shortly after exposure.

Its determination, based on immunistochemical analysis of p16 oncoprotein requires an invasive biopsy. Thus, alternative methods are being sought. Determining oral HPV16 status appears to be a promising alternative. However, it is not used routinely. This prompted us to perform a systematic literature review enabling us to evaluate the diagnostic and predictive ability of this approach. Thirty-four relevant studies were finally selected. For determination of HPV status in OPC, the calculated average sensitivity and specificity for oral sampling was 74% and 91%, respectively, with p16 tumour tissue marker being the gold standard. The method appears to be valuable in monitoring treatment response as well as the biological activity of the tumour, enabling early detection of persistent or relapsing carcinoma sufficiently long before its clinical and/or radiological manifestation. It can also contribute to identification of the primary tumour in cases of metastases of unknown origin. Last but not least, the screening HPV oral testing would help to identify individuals with persistent HPV oral infection who are at increased risk of development of OPC.",

However, heterogeneous HER2 overexpression in GC, loss of HER2 expression during therapy, and inability to non-invasively identify HER2 overexpressing tumors impede effective targeting therapies. Improved HER2-specific functional imaging can address these challenges. Trastuzumab is a HER2-directed mAb to treat HER2 overexpressing cancers. The 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab radiotracer is used to detect HER2+ metastatic breast cancer. We aimed to develop 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET-CT to detect and characterize tumor uptake in HER2+ or - GC patients. We conducted a single-arm phase II pilot study exploring the feasibility of 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab for PET imaging of HER2 overexpressing GC compared to HER2 non-expressing tumors. Eight patients with biopsy-confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma were included. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate primary tumor biopsies for HER2 overexpression. Patients were injected with 45\u2005mg of cold trastuzumab followed by 5\u2005mg of 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab. PET-CT scans were performed 24-48\u2005h post radiotracer injection and compared to standard staging CT scans. We observed limited toxicity following 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab injections. While there was uptake of the radiotracer in portions of HER2+ lesions, there was no statistically significant distinction between tumor and background by standardized uptake value analysis. Despite the potential of 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET imaging of HER2+ metastatic breast cancer, a 5\u2005mg dose of this radiotracer injected 24-48\u2005h before imaging was insufficient to identify HER2+ GC.

Most studies, however, have been conducted in Asian countries, and conflicting results have been reported by other investigators. We conducted a retrospective study of all 377 cases of gastric cancer resected at a tertiary hospital in Spain between 2000 and 2019. Clinicopathologic features were collected, LODDS were calculated and categorized into 5 groups (S1-S5), and statistical analysis was performed.

Area under the curve values for recurrence and death were superior for the LODDS classification, and this classification was independently related to OS and DFS. In addition, the LODDS classification successfully divided patients without lymph node metastases (pN0) into subgroups with distinct prognoses. For our cohort, the LODDS system showed better prognostic performance than pN stage; it was an independent predictor of OS and DFS, and it provided valuable prognostic information in cases without lymph node metastases.

One of the most important characteristics of pancreatic cancer is its ability to grow under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia is associated with resistance of cancer cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. It is a major contributor to pancreatic cancer genetic instability, which local and systemic resistance that may result in poor clinical outcome. Accordingly, identifying gene expression changes in cancer resistance genes that occur under hypoxic conditions may identify a new therapeutic target. The aim of the present study was to explore the association between hypoxia and resistance to chemotherapy and determine the alteration in the expression of cancer resistance-related genes in the presence of hypoxia. Pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1) were exposed to 8 h hypoxic episodes (<1% oxygen) three times/week for a total of 20 episodes (chronic hypoxia) or 72 h hypoxic episodes twice/week for a total of 10 episodes (acute hypoxia). The alterations in gene expression were examined using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR array compared with normoxic cells. Chemoresistance of hypoxic cells toward doxorubicin was assessed using MTT cell proliferation assay. Both chronic and acute hypoxia induced chemoresistance toward doxorubicin in PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cell line. The greatest changes occurred in estrogen Receptor Alpha Gene (ESR1) and ETS Like-1 protein (ELK1) pathways, in nucleic transcription factor Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and in a cell cycle inhibitor cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A).

        "AbstractText": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the deadliest types of cancer with poor prognosis, accounting for 85% of all lung cancer cases. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is most frequently altered in NSCLC; nonetheless, targeting this pathway yields limited success primarily because of drug-induced resistance. PI3K-independent activation of serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1 (SGK1) is responsible for development of resistance to PI3K/AKT inhibitors in breast cancer. The present study investigated potential of inhibiting SGK1 activity for the potentiation of PI3K inhibitor activity in NSCLC cell lines using in vitro anti-proliferation assays, protein expression profiling using western blotting and cell cycle analysis. The findings revealed that combined inhibition of PI3K/AKT and SGK1 resulted in synergistic anticancer activity, with increased apoptosis, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Furthermore, high SGK1 protein expression in NSCLC cell lines was associated with increased resistance to PI3K inhibitors. Therefore, enhanced SGK1 expression may serve as a marker to predict therapeutic response to PI3K/AKT inhibitors. Profiling of downstream signaling proteins demonstrated that, at the molecular level SGK1-mediated sensitization of NSCLC cell lines to PI3K inhibitors was achieved via inhibition of mTORC1 signaling. Increased sensitivity of NSCLC cell lines was also mediated by other oncogenic pathways, such as Ras/MEK/ERK and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling.",

Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are being increasingly recognized as promising biomarkers given the stability and enrichment of miRNAs in exosomes. The high sensitivity of the reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) has enabled accurate quantification of miRNAs and small fragments, present in a low abundance, in the circulation. In the present study, the potential of miRNAs in the diagnosis of PCOS was evaluated. Exosomal miRNAs were extracted and screened, and three miRNAs (miR-4488, miR-151a-5p, and miR-223-3p) were found to be differentially expressed between the PCOS group and age-matched controls by sequencing analysis. RT-qPCR was performed on a clinically confirmed PCOS cohort (n=107) and a non-PCOS control cohort (n=101) from South China to validate the PCOS-related RNA sequencing results. miR-151a-5p and miR-4488 expression levels were significantly upregulated, and miR-223-3p expression was downregulated in the PCOS cohort compared with the control cohort (P<0.05). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.889, 0.871, and 0.664 for miR-4488, miR-151a-5p, and miR-223-3p, respectively. Combining anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone levels with the three miRNAs resulted in an AUC of 0.967, and higher sensitivity and specificity.

Furthermore, the prognostic and mutation analysis was performed on these hub genes. Finally, the associations of the hub gene with immune cells were investigated. A total of 802 DEGs were obtained between the THCA group and the N group. These DEGs were mainly enriched in pathways such as lysine degradation. From the PPI network, 20 hub genes, including CD44, CCND1, SNAI1, and KIT, were investigated. The survival analysis showed that the up-regulation of CD44 and down-regulation of SNAI1 contributed to the favorable and unfavorable outcomes of patients with THCA, respectively. Meanwhile, the diagnostic analysis showed that the AUC of KIT in THCA was larger than 0.9. Furthermore, the gene mutation analysis showed that the alternated CCND1 participated in the cell cycle pathway. Finally, the correlation analysis showed that prognostic genes such as CD44 were positively correlated with immune cells such as M1 macrophages. A total of 20 hub genes including CCND1, CD44, SNAI1, and KIT were revealed as potential biomarkers for the differential diagnosis, prognosis, and development of drug targets of THCA. The lysine degradation pathway and cell cycle pathway might take part in the progression of THCA.",

        "AbstractText": "Tumor progression and the therapeutic resistance associated with cancer agents are thought to be modulated by circular RNAs (circRNAs); however, its mechanism associated with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still undetermined. The following investigation aimed to evaluate the involvement of circRNAs with NSCLC. The serum specimens of 146 NSCLC individuals who received complete four cycles of PTX chemotherapy were collected. The serum concentration of hsa_circ_0005962 of these individuals was assessed with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), followed by the evaluation of demographic and survival consequences for further assessments. It was revealed that hsa_circ_0005962 is substantially increased in NSCLC chemoresistant patients and was positively correlated with the disease stage. Furthermore, the hsa_circ_0005962 value of the area under the curve was moderate, and increased hsa_circ_0005962 expression was linked with shorter overall survival (OS). Hsa_circ_0005962 stimulated paclitaxel resistance (PTX-R) in resistant NSCLC cells by regulating the axis of miR-126-5p/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1). The results of this investigation highlight that hsa_circ_0005962 induces chemoresistance in NSCLC patients and, therefore, can act as a physiological target to treat NSCLC.",

        "AbstractText": "Myelofibrosis (MF) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm that typically manifests with debilitating symptoms that progressively worsen, negatively impacting patients' quality of life. Fatigue is a multifactorial and burdensome MF-related symptom due to its severity, persistence, and prevalence, with anemia a contributing factor and major unmet need. Clinical trials of the Janus kinase (JAK)1/JAK2/activin A receptor type 1 inhibitor momelotinib have shown consistent anemia benefits, in addition to improvements in MF-related symptoms. The phase 3 MOMENTUM trial in symptomatic and anemic patients met its primary end point, with a greater proportion having a Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF) Total Symptom Score (TSS) reduction \u226550% at week 24 with momelotinib versus danazol. To support the positive primary end point result, we conducted longitudinal, responder, and time-to-event analyses of patient-reported outcomes from MOMENTUM, as measured by the MFSAF, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) assessments. These analyses demonstrated rapid and durable response benefits with momelotinib, with achievement of first TSS response by day 29 and continued improvement over time. Improvements favored momelotinib versus danazol for each MFSAF individual item, and greater improvements were observed for disease- and cancer-related fatigue and physical functioning at week 24, with significant results for multiple items/domains across the 3 assessments. These findings are consistent in demonstrating that momelotinib provides substantial symptom benefit.",

        "AbstractText": "Despite the great diversity of malonate semialdehyde decarboxylases (MSADs), one of five subgroups of the tautomerase superfamily (TSF) found throughout the biosphere, their distribution among strains within the genus Mycobacterium remains unknown. In this study, we sought to investigate the phylogenetic distribution of MSAD genes of mycobacterial species via genome analysis of 192 different reference Mycobacterium species or subspecies retrieved from NCBI databases. We found that in a total of 87 of 192 strains (45.3%), MSAD-1 and MSAD-2 were distributed in an exclusive manner among Mycobacterium species except for 12 strains, including Mycobacterium chelonae members, with both in their genome. Of note, Mycobacterium strains better adapted to the host and of high virulence potential, such as the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium marinum, Mycobacterium ulcerans, and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, had no orthologs of MSAD in their genome, suggesting MSAD loss during species differentiation in pathogenic slow-growing Mycobacterium. To investigate the MSAD distribution among strains of M. avium subspecies, the genome sequences of a total of 255 reference strains from the four subspecies of M. avium (43 of subspecies avium, 162 of subspecies hominissuis, 49 of subspecies paratuberculosis, and 1 of subspecies silvaticum) were further analyzed. We found that only 121 of 255 strains (47.4%) had MSADs in their genome, with none of the 49 M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis strains having MSAD genes. Even in 13 of 121 M. avium strains with the MSAD-1 gene in their genome, deletion mutations in the 98th codon causing premature termination of MSAD were found, further highlighting the occurrence of MSAD pseudogenization during species or subspecies differentiation of M. avium. In conclusion, our data indicated that there are two distinct types of MSADs, MSAD-1 and MSAD-2, among strains in the Mycobacterium genus, but more than half of the strains, including pathogenic mycobacteria, M. tuberculosis and M. leprae, have no orthologs in their genome, suggesting MSAD loss during host adaptation of pathogenic mycobacteria. In the future, the role of two distinct MSADs, MSAD-1 and MSAD-2, in mycobacterial pathogenesis or evolution should be investigated.",

Recent studies focusing on the intratumoral microbiota of colorectal cancer have revealed its role in oncogenesis and tumor progression. However, limited research has focused on the influence of intratumoral microbiota on the nCRT of LARC. We explored the microbial profiles in the tumor microenvironment of LARC using RNA-seq data from a published European cohort. Microbial signatures were characterized in pathological complete response (pCR) and non-pCR groups. Multi-omics analysis was performed between intratumor microbiomes and transcriptomes. Microbial \u03b1 and \u03b2 diversity were significantly different in pCR and non-pCR groups. Twelve differential microbes were discovered between the pCR and non-pCR groups, six of which were related to subclusters of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) associated with extracellular matrix formation. A microbial risk score based on the relative abundance of seven differential microbes had predictive value for the nCRT response (AUC\u2009=\u20090.820, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Our study presents intratumoral microbes as potential independent predictive markers for the response of nCRT to LARC and demonstrates the underlying mechanism by which the interaction between intratumoral microbes and CAFs mediates the response to nCRT.",

        "AbstractText": "Lung cancer is indeed a major cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The development of tumors involves a complex interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation (DNAm), histone modifications, and microRNA expression, play a crucial role in this process. Changes in DNAm patterns can lead to the silencing of important genes involved in cellular functions, contributing to the development and progression of lung cancer. MicroRNAs and exosomes have also emerged as reliable biomarkers for lung cancer. They can provide valuable information about early diagnosis and treatment assessment. In particular, abnormal hypermethylation of gene promoters and its effects on tumorigenesis, as well as its roles in the Wnt signaling pathway, have been extensively studied. Epigenetic drugs have shown promise in the treatment of lung cancer. These drugs target the aberrant epigenetic modifications that are involved in the development and progression of the disease. Several factors have been identified as drug targets in non-small cell lung cancer. Recently, combination therapy has been discussed as a successful strategy for overcoming drug resistance. Overall, understanding the role of epigenetic mechanisms and their targeting through drugs is an important area of research in lung cancer treatment.",

Furthermore, the association in individuals with preexisting risk factors is unknown. We aimed to investigate the association between smoking status (especially smoking cessation) and CCA risk according to individuals' glycemic status. In this nationwide cohort study, 9,520,629 adults without cancer who underwent national health screening by the Korean National Health Insurance Service in 2009 were followed up through 2018. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CCA were estimated after adjusting for potential confounders. During the 78.3 person-years of follow-up, 16,236 individuals were newly diagnosed with CCA. Quitters had a significantly lower risk of iCCA and eCCA compared to current smokers in all glycemic status groups (all p < 0.01). The HRs (95% CIs) for iCCA in current smokers and quitters were 1.33 (1.24-1.43) versus 0.98 (0.90-1.06) in individuals with normoglycemia, 1.49 (1.37-1.63) versus 1.17 (1.06-1.28) in individuals with prediabetes, and 2.15 (1.96-2.37) versus 1.58 (1.42-1.75) in individuals with diabetes, compared to never-smokers with normoglycemia. Current smokers with diabetes or prediabetes had a synergistically increased risk of iCCA (all p < 0.01). However, quitters with diabetes and prediabetes had an iCCA risk comparable to that of never-smokers. Analysis of eCCA yielded similar results. Smoking was not independently associated with the risk of the ampulla of Vater cancer. However, smoking combined with diabetes or prediabetes was associated with an increased risk of the ampulla of Vater cancer (all p < 0.05). Smoking cessation was associated with a reduced risk of CCA, despite the synergistically increased risk in current smokers with diabetes and prediabetes.

Patients with treatment-na\u00efve unresectable HCC, \u22651 measurable untreated lesion, and Child-Pugh class A liver function were randomized 2:1 to receive atezolizumab 1,200 mg + bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks or sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed in the intention-to-treat population by ALBI/modified (m)ALBI grade. Time to deterioration (TTD; defined as time to 0.5-point increase from the baseline ALBI score over 2 visits or death) of liver function and safety were investigated. Of 501 enrolled patients, 336 were randomized to receive atezolizumab + bevacizumab (ALBI grade [G] 1: n = 191; G2: n = 144 [mALBI G2a: n = 72, G2b: n = 72]; missing ALBI grade: n = 1) and 165 to sorafenib (ALBI G1: n = 87; G2: n = 78 [mALBI G2a: n = 37; G2b: n = 41]).

It is a non-invasive, safe, cost-effective, and reliable technique reported to exhibit a high success rate. However, due to being technically demanding and time-consuming and having the need of employing trained staff, this technique is only used in restricted research centres and in limited centres of clinical use. When the sputum is collected after induction, the primary goal is to obtain a differential cell count and evaluate the molecular biomarkers of airway inflammation such as eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, major basic protein, tryptase, cytokine production [e.g., interleukin (IL)-5], albumin, and fibrinogen. In addition, cytospins from the processed sputum are used for immunocytochemical staining of cellular products such as EG-2 reactive protein, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, tumour necrosis factor alpha, and IL-8 that play significant roles in understanding the pathophysiology of inflammatory airway diseases. Nowadays, this technique can be further used by performing an additional analysis such as flow cytometry and in situ hybridisation on the sputum supernatant to investigate more the immune response and pathophysiological process of such various respiratory diseases. In addition, the application of sputum fluid phase to assess the biomarkers could be used more routinely in pathological laboratories for diagnosing lung cancer, COPD, and asthma as well as for monitoring lung cancer progression and asthma and COPD treatment, allowing for early detection and a better treatment provided by the clinicians.",

The challenge lies in developing targeted therapies that can effectively address the specific genetic mutations or abnormalities associated with each subtype.

Computational studies using COMSOL software could provide an economical, fast and resourceful approach to the treatment of complicated cancers like leukemia. Using COMSOL Multiphysics software, a continuous flow microfluidic device capable of delivering anti-leukemia drugs to early-stage leukemia cells has been computationally modeled using dielectrophoresis (DEP). The cell size difference enabled the micro-particle drug attachment to the leukemia cells using hydrodynamic focusing from the dielectrophoretic force. This point of care application produced a low voltage from numerically calculated electrical field and flow speed simulations. Therefore, such a dielectrophoretic low voltage application model can be used as a computational treatment reference for early-stage leukemia cells with an approximate size of 5\u2005\u03bcm.",

However, using simple anastomosis techniques alone may not meet the needs of patients in some cases and can lead to complications such as anastomotic stenosis and ulceration. In order to overcome these issues and improve patient prognosis, muscle flap reconstruction technique has emerged. Muscle flap reconstruction is a method of improving gastric-esophageal anastomosis by transplanting muscle tissue. By covering the anastomotic site with muscle tissue, it not only enhances the stability of the anastomosis site but also increases blood supply, promoting healing and recovery of the anastomosis. Therefore, the use of muscle flap reconstruction technique in esophageal gastric anastomosis during total gastrectomy for gastric cancer is increasingly widely applied. To determine the effectiveness of esophagogastric anastomosis using the muscle flap reconstruction technology in total abdominal gastrectomy for gastric cancer and perform follow-up experiments to understand the factors affecting patients' prognosis. The study subjects were 60 patients with gastric cancer who were admitted to our hospital between October 2018 and January 2022. All patients underwent esophagogastric anastomosis using the double muscle flap reconstruction technology in total abdominal gastrectomy. Perioperative indicators were determined, and patients were followed up for 1 year. Furthermore, patient outcomes were observed within 1 year, followed by patient classification based on different outcomes. Moreover, clinicopathological parameters were observed and relevant factors affecting patient prognosis were analyzed. The operation time was 318 \u00b1 43 min, the formation time of esophageal double muscle flap anastomosis was 110 \u00b1 13 min, the number of lymph node dissections was 26 \u00b1 6, the incision length was 3 \u00b1 0.6 cm, intraoperative bleeding volume was 48 \u00b1 15 mL, first anal exhaust time was 5.3 \u00b1 1.8 d, first meal time was 6.0 \u00b1 1.6 d, length of hospital stay was 11.8 \u00b1 2.5, and treatment cost was 5.8 \u00b1 0.7 thousand yuan.

In addition, ICG can be conjugated to artificially created antibodies for tumour markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen for colorectal, breast, lung, and gastric cancer, prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer, and cancer antigen 125 for ovarian cancer. Although ICG has shown promising results, the optimization of patient factors, dye factors, equipment, and the method of assessing fluorescence intensity could further enhance its utility. This review summarizes the clinical application of ICG in gastrointestinal surgery and discusses the emergence of novel dyes such as ZW-800 and VM678 that have demonstrated appropriate pharmacokinetic properties and improved target-to-background ratios in animal studies. With the emergence of robotic technology and the increasing reporting of ICG utility, a comprehensive review of clinical application of ICG in gastrointestinal surgery is timely and this review serves that aim.",

        "AbstractText": "The incidence and mortality of liver cancer are among the highest of all malignant tumors in China. The high recurrence rate after conventional hepatectomy is worrying. There is a lack of effective prognostic indicators for liver cancer. To explore the clinical significance of preoperative serum oxidative stress and serum uric acid (UA) levels in hepatitis B-related liver cancer. The medical records of 110 hepatitis B-related liver cancer patients who underwent hepatectomy in Gansu Provincial Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Recurrence in patients within 3 years after surgery was determined. The logistic regression model and Pearson or Spearman correlation were used to analyze the correlation between oxidative stress level and UA, and the recurrence of hepatitis B-related liver cancer. Compared with the non-recurrence group, the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) in the recurrence group were lower and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and UA were higher (all P < 0.05). UA, SOD, MDA, and GSH were risk factors for postoperative recurrence in hepatitis B-related liver cancer patients (P < 0.05). UA was positively correlated with MDA (r = 0.395, P < 0.001) and negatively correlated with GSH (r = -0.204, P = 0.032). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of SOD, MDA, GSH, and UA in predicting the prognosis was 0.276, 0.910, 0.199, and 0.784, respectively (all P < 0.001). The preoperative serum SOD, GSH, MDA, and UA levels had significant predictive effects on postoperative recurrence of hepatitis B-related liver cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "It remains unclear whether laparoscopic multisegmental resection and anastomosis (LMRA) is safe and advantageous over traditional open multisegmental resection and anastomosis (OMRA) for treating synchronous colorectal cancer (SCRC) located in separate segments. To compare the short-term efficacy and long-term prognosis of OMRA as well as LMRA for SCRC located in separate segments. Patients with SCRC who underwent surgery between January 2010 and December 2021 at the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the Peking University First Hospital were retrospectively recruited. In accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 109 patients who received right hemicolectomy together with anterior resection of the rectum or right hemicolectomy and sigmoid colectomy were finally included in the study. Patients were divided into the LMRA and OMRA groups (n = 68 and 41, respectively) according to the surgical method used. The groups were compared regarding the surgical procedure's short-term efficacy and its effect on long-term patient survival. LMRA patients showed markedly less intraoperative blood loss than OMRA patients (100 vs 200 mL, P = 0.006). Compared to OMRA patients, LMRA patients exhibited markedly shorter postoperative first exhaust time (2 vs 3 d, P = 0.001), postoperative first fluid intake time (3 vs 4 d, P = 0.012), and postoperative hospital stay (9 vs 12 d, P = 0.002). The incidence of total postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade: \u2265 II) was 2.9% and 17.1% (P = 0.025) in the LMRA and OMRA groups, respectively, while the incidence of anastomotic leakage was 2.9% and 7.3% (P = 0.558) in the LMRA and OMRA groups, respectively. Furthermore, the LMRA group had a higher mean number of lymph nodes dissected than the OMRA group (45.2 vs 37.3, P = 0.020). The 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates in OMRA patients were 82.9% and 78.3%, respectively, while these rates in LMRA patients were 78.2% and 72.8%, respectively. Multivariate prognostic analysis revealed that N stage [OS: HR hazard ratio (HR) = 10.161, P = 0.026; DFS: HR = 13.017, P = 0.013], but not the surgical method (LMRA/OMRA) (OS: HR = 0.834, P = 0.749; DFS: HR = 0.812, P = 0.712), was the independent influencing factor in the OS and DFS of patients with SCRC. LMRA is safe and feasible for patients with SCRC located in separate segments. Compared to OMRA, the LMRA approach has more advantages related to short-term efficacy.",

        "AbstractText": "Situs inversus totalis (SIT) is a rare condition in which the positions of abdominal and thoracic organs present a \"mirror image\" of the normal ones in the median sagittal plane. Although minimally invasive surgery has evolved to achieve laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer (GC) patients with SIT, it is difficult to perform lymphadenectomy (LND) in such a transposed anatomical condition. Herein, we report the cases of two patients with SIT who successfully underwent laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG) with D2 LND. Case 1: A 65-year-old man was admitted for intermittent abdominal pain and distension, occasional belching, and acid reflux for 4 mo. He was diagnosed with GC (cT3N1-2M0) with SIT. Before surgery, he had undergone four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Then, the patient was evaluated as having a partial response, and laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy with D2 LND and Billroth II reconstruction were performed. The operation was performed successfully within 240 min with an estimated blood loss of 50 mL and no severe complications. The patient was discharged on postoperative day (POD) 9. Case 2: A 55-year-old man was admitted for upper abdominal distension with pain and discomfort after eating for 3 mo. He was diagnosed with GC (cT3N1M0) with SIT. He had a history of hypertension for more than 10 years; however, his blood pressure was well-controlled via regular medication. We performed laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy with D2 LND and Roux-en-Y reconstruction. The operation was performed successfully within 168 min with an estimated blood loss of 50 mL and no severe complications. The patient was discharged on POD 10. LAG with D2 LND could be considered an accessible, safe, and curative procedure for advanced GC patients with SIT.",

A transthoracic approach is recommended for Siewert I adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction and a transabdominal approach is recommended for Siewert III adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction. However, there is a need to determine the optimal surgical approach for Siewert II adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction to improve lung function and the prognosis of patients. To investigate and compare the surgical effects, postoperative changes in pulmonary function, and prognoses of two approaches to treating combined esophagogastric cancer. One hundred and thirty-eight patients with combined esophagogastric cancer treated by general and thoracic surgeries in our hospital were selected. They were divided into group A comprising 70 patients (transabdominal approach) and group B comprising 68 patients (transthoracic approach) based on the surgical approach. The indexes related to surgical trauma, number of removed lymph nodes, indexes of lung function before and after surgery, survival rate, and survival duration of the two groups were compared 3 years after surgery. The duration of surgery, length of hospital stay, and postoperative drainage duration of the patients in group A were shorter than those of the patients in group B, and the volume of blood loss caused by surgery was lower for group A than for group B (P < 0.05). At the one-month postoperative review, the first second, maximum ventilation volume, forceful lung volume, and lung volume values were higher for group A than for group B (P < 0.05). Preoperatively, the QLQ-OES18 scale scores of the patients in group A were higher than those in group B on re-evaluation at 3 mo postoperatively (P < 0.05). The surgical complication rate of the patients in group A was 10.00%, which was lower than that of patients in group B, which was 23.53% (P < 0.05). Transabdominal and transthoracic surgical approaches are comparable in treating combined esophagogastric cancer; however, the former results in lesser surgical trauma, milder changes in pulmonary function, and fewer complications.",

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a non-invasive, safe, and cost-effective method for evaluating tumour blood vessels, that play a crucial role in tumour growth and progression. To explore CEUS's role in the quantitative evaluation of CRC blood vessels and their correlation with angiogenesis markers and prognosis. This study prospectively enrolled 100 patients with CRC confirmed by histopathology. All patients received preoperative CEUS examinations. Quantitative parameters, such as peak intensity (PI), time to peak (TTP), and area under the curve (AUC), were derived from time-intensity curve (TIC) analysis. Tumour tissue samples were obtained during surgery and examined immunohistochemically to assess the expression of angiogenesis markers, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and microvessel density (MVD). The correlation between CEUS parameters, angiogenesis markers, and clinicopathological features was evaluated using appropriate statistical tests. Quantitative CEUS parameters (PI, TTP, and AUC) showed significant correlations with VEGF expression (P < 0.001) and MVD (P < 0.001), indicating a strong link between tumour blood vessels and angiogenesis. Increased PI, reduced TTP, and expanded AUC values were significantly related to higher tumour stage (P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), and distant metastasis (P < 0.001). Furthermore, these parameters were recognized as independent predictors of overall survival and disease-free survival in multivariate analysis (P < 0.001). CEUS has a high potential in guiding treatment planning and predicting patient outcomes. However, more comprehensive, multicentre studies are required to validate the clinical utility of CEUS in CRC management.",

To investigate the efficacy of an intestinal obstruction tube combined with meglumine diazo in treating EPISBO of colorectal cancer. Data from 60 patients with colorectal cancer and intestinal obstruction admitted to the Proctology Department of our hospital from April 2018 to May 2022 were collected and analyzed and divided into three cohorts according to different treatment regimens. Cohort A (n = 20) received a transnasal intestinal obstruction catheter with panumglumine, and cohort B (n = 20) received a transnasal intestinal obstruction catheter with liquid paraffin. Cohort C (n = 20) received oral treatment with meglumine. The clinical efficacy, first exhaust/defecation time, length of hospital stay, gastrointestinal decompression time, relief time of abdominal pain, and relief time of abdominal distension were compared among the three cohorts.

        "AbstractText": "Early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) is essential to reduce cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Stool DNA (sDNA) testing is an emerging method for early CRC detection. Syndecan-2 (SDC2) methylation is a potential biomarker for the sDNA testing. Aberrant DNA methylation is an early epigenetic event during tumorigenesis and can occur in the normal colonic mucosa during aging, which can compromise the sDNA test results. To determine whether methylated SDC2 in sDNA normalizes after surgical resection of CRC. In this prospective study, we enrolled 151 patients with CRC who underwent curative surgical resection between September 2016 and May 2020. Preoperative stool samples were collected from 123 patients and postoperative samples were collected from 122 patients. A total of 104 samples were collected from both preoperative and postoperative patients. Aberrant promoter methylation of SDC2 in sDNA was assessed using linear target enrichment quantitative methylation-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction. Clinicopathological parameters were analyzed using the results of SDC2 methylation. Detection rates of SDC2 methylation in the preoperative and postoperative stool samples were 88.6% and 19.7%, respectively. Large tumor size (3 cm, P = 0.019) and advanced T stage (T3-T4, P = 0.033) were positively associated with the detection rate of SDC2 methylation before surgery. Female sex was associated with false positives after surgery (P = 0.030). Cycle threshold (CT) values were significantly decreased postoperatively compared with preoperative values (P < 0.001). The postoperative negative conversion rate for preoperatively methylated SDC2 was 79.3% (73/92). Our results suggested that the SDC2 methylation test for sDNA has acceptable sensitivity and specificity. However, small size and early T stage tumors are associated with a low detection rate of SDC2 methylation. As the cycle threshold values significantly decreased after surgery, SDC2 methylation test for sDNA might have a diagnostic value for CRC.",

No residual disease was found following endoscopic polypectomy in two patients (7.8%), but four (15.4%) had other pathologies. Surgical margins were negative in all cases. Local recurrence was detected in one patient 33 mo following surgery. Among young adult patients, TEM for benign rectal lesions has excellent outcomes. It may also offer a balance between the efficacy of complete oncologic resection and postoperative quality of life in the treatment of rectal cancer.

The analysis of risk factors for stress ulcer (SU) in patients with CRC is important to reduce mortality and improve patient prognosis. To identify risk factors for SU after laparoscopic surgery for CRC, and develop a nomogram model to predict the risk of SU in these patients. METHODSThe clinical data of 135 patients with CRC who underwent laparoscopic surgery between November 2021 and June 2022 were reviewed retrospectively. They were divided into two categories depending on the presence of SUs: The SU group (n = 23) and the non-SU group (n = 112). Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to screen for factors associated with postoperative SU in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery, and a risk factor-based nomogram model was built based on these risk factors. By plotting the model's receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration curve, a Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test was performed. Among the 135 patients with CRC, 23 patients had postoperative SU, with an incidence of 17.04%. The SU group had higher levels of heat shock protein (HSP) 70, HSP90, and gastrin (GAS) than the non-SU group. Age, lymph node metastasis, HSP70, HSP90, and GAS levels were statistically different between the two groups, but other indicators were not statistically different. Logistic regression analysis showed that age \u2265 65 years, lymph node metastasis, and increased levels of HSP70, HSP90 and GAS were all risk factors for postoperative SU in patients with CRC (P < 0.05). According to these five risk factors, the area under the ROC curve for the nomogram model was 0.988 (95%CI: 0.971-1.0); the calibration curve demonstrated excellent agreement between predicted and actual probabilities, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test revealed that the difference was not statistically significant (\u03c72 = 0.753, P = 0.999), suggesting that the nomogram model had good discrimination, calibration, and stability. Patients with CRC aged \u2265 65 years, with lymph node metastasis and elevated HSP70, HSP90, GAS levels, are prone to post-laparoscopic surgery SU. Our nomogram model shows good predictive value.",

They all had endometriosis for a long time and had undergone ovarian cyst removal due to a chocolate cyst. Unfortunately, the cyst recurred after surgery, and the histological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma. In case 1, the expression of P53 was found in the tumor by regular examination, and the stage was IIB. In Case 2, we found it in intraoperative freezing; the stage was IA. Case 1 has been treated with the TP regimen six times, and the survival period has reached one year. Case 2 had a survival period of 6 years after completing six TP regimen treatments. Clinicians should pay attention to patients with a long history of endometriosis and postoperative recurrence of ovarian cysts accompanied by serum CA-125 of more than 200U/mL. Imaging examination has a good prospect in diagnosing malignant transformation of endometriosis, especially PET-CT. This case report highlights the risk factors related to the formation of ovarian clear cell carcinoma and suggests that the follow-up of patients with ovarian endometriosis is essential because of its recurrence characteristics.

        "AbstractText": "Introduction: Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) is one of the most common primary intracranial neoplasms in childhood with an overall favorable prognosis. Despite decades of experience, there are still diagnostic and treatment challenges and unresolved issues regarding risk factors associated with recurrence, most often due to conclusions of publications with limited data. We analyzed 499 patients with PA diagnosed in a single institution over 30 years in order to provide answers to some of the unresolved issues. Materials and Methods: We identified pilocytic astrocytomas diagnosed at the University of California, San Francisco, between 1989 and 2019, confirmed the diagnoses using the WHO 2021 essential and desirable criteria, and performed a retrospective review of the demographic and clinical features of the patients and the radiological, pathologic and molecular features of the tumors. Results: Among the patients identified from pathology archives, 499 cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Median age at presentation was 12 years (range 3.5 months - 73 years) and the median follow-up was 78.5 months. Tumors were predominantly located in the posterior fossa (52.6%). There were six deaths, but there were confounding factors that prevented a clear association of death to tumor progression. Extent of resection was the only significant factor for recurrence-free survival. Recurrence-free survival time was 321.0 months for gross total resection, compared to 160.9 months for subtotal resection (log rank, p <0.001). Conclusion: Multivariate analysis was able to identify extent of resection as the only significant variable to influence recurrence-free survival. We did not find a statistically significant association between age, NF1 status, tumor location, molecular alterations, and outcome. Smaller series with apparently significant results may have suffered from limited sample size, limited variables, acceptance of univariate analysis findings as well as a larger p value for biological significance. PA still remains a predominantly surgical disease and every attempt should be made to achieve gross total resection since this appears to be the most reliable predictor of recurrence-free survival.",

        "ArticleTitle": "A Case of Binocular Metastatic Choroidal Tumor Originating from Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma Successfully Treated with Molecular Target Therapy.",
        "AbstractText": "The occurrence of ocular metastasis from lung cancer is uncommon. In our current case, we report on a 64-year-old male patient found to have metastatic lesions in both choroids after being diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma. As the patient was found to have a mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), he was treated with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI), afatinib. However, the treatment response suggested the presence of a progressive disease. Thus, due to cancerous meningitis, the patient's treatment was changed from afatinib to erlotinib, in addition to adding bevacizumab. Although the general condition of the patient did not change, improvement was noted for the choroidal metastasis. Moreover, the drug change also resulted in an improvement of the visual power of both eyes. Therefore, the results for this patient suggest that systemic administration of erlotinib and bevacizumab may be an effective treatment that leads to morphological and functional improvement in choroidal metastasis cases.",

        "AbstractText": "Lung cancer is one of the most common cancer types worldwide. The significance of the individual socio-economic position on the delay in lung cancer diagnosis has not been properly investigated. The purpose of this nationwide population-based study is to examine the association between position and the length of the primary investigation for lung cancer. This register study was based on all lung cancer patients in Denmark who were diagnosed in 2012 to 2017, in total 28,431 patients. We used a multivariate logistic regression model and multivariate zero-inflated negative binomial model to estimate the effect of education level, family income, difficulty of transport, and cohabitation status on the length of the primary investigation. We found that the patients' income, difficulty of transport, and cohabitation status were associated with the length of the primary investigation. The chance of carrying out the investigation process within 24 days is higher for patients with a high income (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20090.86 with 95% CI (0.81; 0.91)), lower for patients with troublesome transport (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20090.67 with 95% CI (0.61; 0.72)), and lower for patients living alone (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20090.93 with 95% CI (0.88; 0.99)). Several socio-economic factors are associated with the length of the primary lung cancer investigation. To ensure that all patients receive the most appropriate health care and to avoid extra investigation time, clinicians may pay extra attention to patients who are less fortunate due to low income, troublesome transport to the hospital, or living alone.",

        "AbstractText": "Aging is associated with a decline in visual function and increased prevalence of ocular disease, correlating with changes in the transcriptome and epigenome of cells in the eye. Here, we sought to identify the transcriptional mechanisms that are necessary to maintain photoreceptor viability and function during aging. To do this, we performed a targeted photoreceptor-specific RNAi screen in Drosophila to identify transcriptional regulators whose knockdown results in premature, age-dependent retinal degeneration. From an initial set of 155 RNAi lines each targeting a unique gene and spanning a diverse set of transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, and histone modifiers, we identified 18 high-confidence target genes whose decreased expression in adult photoreceptors leads to premature and progressive retinal degeneration. These 18 target genes were enriched for factors involved in the regulation of transcription initiation, pausing, and elongation, suggesting that these processes are essential for maintaining the health of aging photoreceptors. To identify the genes regulated by these factors, we profiled the photoreceptor transcriptome in a subset of lines. Strikingly, two of the 18 target genes, Spt5 and domino, show similar changes in gene expression to those observed in photoreceptors with advanced age. Together, our data suggest that dysregulation of factors involved in transcription initiation and elongation plays a key role in shaping the transcriptome of aging photoreceptors. Further, our findings indicate that the age-dependent changes in gene expression not only correlate but might also contribute to an increased risk of retinal degeneration.",

        "AbstractText": "Recently, much interest has been devoted to finding effective G-quadruplex ligands, both of synthetic or natural origins, which may be of potential use in the field of cancer therapy. Among compounds of natural origin, a common flavonol quercetin has attracted notable attention. Yet, only a modest number of papers have been concerned with a comparison of quercetin conjugates binding to G-quadruplexes. In this study, we applied the survival yield (SY) method in order to compare the stability of G-tetrad complexes with quercetin and its conjugates, namely, 3-O-glycosides and O-methylated conjugates. According to the determined values of Ecom\u03b450, flavonol glycosides bind most effectively with G-tetrads, whereas, among flavonols, 3-O-methylquercetin makes the most effective bonds. Because the aglycone structure is of crucial importance for biological processes, 3-O-methylquercetin seems to be a suitable candidate for anticancer therapeutics, and the extracts from the plants, which contain high amounts of 3-O-methylquercetin or its glycosides, should be considered as interesting materials for preparation of pharmaceuticals or dietary supplements.",

BER-encapsulated alginate (ALG)/chitosan (CHS) nanoparticles (BER-ALG/CHS-NPs) were developed for long-acting improved treatment in breast cancer. The surface of the NPs was activated by a conjugation reaction, and thereafter, the BER-ALG/CHS-NP surface was grafted with folic acid (BER-ALG/CHS-NPs-F) for specific targeting in breast cancer. BER-ALG/CHS-NPs-F was optimized by applying the Box-Behnken design using Expert design software. Moreover, formulations are extensively evaluated in vitro for biopharmaceutical performances and tested for cell viability, cellular uptake, and antioxidant activity. The comparative pharmacokinetic study of formulation and free BER was carried out in animals for estimation of bioavailability. The particle size recorded for the diluted sample using a Malvern Zetasizer was 240 \u00b1 5.6 nm. The \u03b6-potential and the predicted % entrapment efficiency versus (vs) observed were +18 mV and 83.25 \u00b1 2.3% vs 85 \u00b1 3.5%. The high % drug release from the NPs was recorded. The analytical studies executed using infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction expressed safe combinations of the components in the formulation and physical state of the drug revealed to be amorphous in the formulation. Cytotoxicity testing demonstrated that the formulation effectively lowered the cell viability and IC50 of the tested cell line in comparison to a raw drug. The cellular uptake of BER-ALG/CHS-NPs-F was 5.5-fold higher than that of BER-suspension. The antioxidant capacities of BER-ALG/CHS-NPs-F vs BER-suspension by the DPPH assay were measured to be 62.3 \u00b1 2.5% vs 30 \u00b1 6%, indicating good radical scavenging power of folate-conjugated NPs. The developed formulation showed a 4.4-fold improved oral bioavailability compared to BER-suspension. The hemolytic assay intimated <2% destruction of erythrocytes by the developed formulation. The observed experimental characterization results such as cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, antioxidant activity, and improved absorption suggested the effectiveness of BER-ALG/CHS-NPs-F toward breast cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "Aberrant regulation of \u03b2-catenin signaling is strongly linked with cancer proliferation, invasion, migration, and metastasis, thus, small molecules that can inhibit this pathway might have great clinical significance. Our molecular modeling studies suggest that ormeloxifene (ORM), a triphenylethylene molecule that docks with \u03b2-catenin, and its brominated analogue (Br-ORM) bind more effectively with relatively less energy (-7.6 kcal/mol) to the active site of \u03b2-catenin as compared to parent ORM. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a Br-ORM by NMR and FTIR, as well as its anticancer activity in cervical cancer models. Br-ORM treatment effectively inhibited tumorigenic features (cell proliferation and colony-forming ability, etc.) and induced apoptotic death, as evident by pronounced PARP cleavage. Furthermore, Br-ORM treatment caused cell cycle arrest at the G1-S phase. Mechanistic investigation revealed that Br-ORM targets the key proteins involved in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as demonstrated by upregulation of E-cadherin and repression of N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expression. Br-ORM also represses the expression and nuclear subcellular localization of \u03b2-catenin. Consequently, Br-ORM treatment effectively inhibited tumor growth in an orthotopic cervical cancer xenograft mouse model along with EMT associated changes as compared to vehicle control-treated mice. Altogether, experimental findings suggest that Br-ORM is a novel, promising \u03b2-catenin inhibitor and therefore can be harnessed as a potent anticancer small molecule for cervical cancer treatment.",

We, therefore, synthesized Fe3O4@ZIF-8@Sor@TA nanocomposite drugs based on the drug delivery properties of nanomaterials. ZIF-8 is a nanomaterial with a porous structure that can load anticancer drugs. The nanodrug used the paramagnetic property of Fe3O4 to deliver sorafenib (Sor) precisely to the tumor site, then used the pH responsiveness of ZIF-8 to slowly release Sor in the tumor microenvironment, and finally used tannic acid (TA) to inhibit P-glycoprotein to suppress the Sor resistance. The results of material characterization presented that the prepared material was structurally stable and was able to achieve a cumulative drug release of 38.2% at pH 5.0 for 72 h. The good biocompatibility of the composite was demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo experiments, which could improve antitumor activity and reduce Sor resistance through magnetic targeting TA.

TQ-SeNPs were synthesized, and their size, morphology, and elemental analysis were characterized. Morphological changes were examined by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The cytotoxicity and viability of nanothymoquinone were assessed by the XTT (2,3-bis (2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5 carboxanilide) assay. Gene expressions and protein levels of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway were analyzed by real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The decrease in the viability of HEC1B endometrial carcinoma cells was observed in a time- and dose-dependent manner. HEC-1B cells were treated with TQ-SeNP at 40-640 \u03bcg/mL concentrations and time intervals, and their viability was assessed by XTT assay. IC50 doses of TQ-SeNP in HEC1B cells were detected as 526.45 \u03bcg/mL at 48th hour. ELISA indicated that TQ-SeNP treatment reduced the level of p38 MAPK. ERK2, MEK2, and NFKB (p65) mRNA expressions were decreased in the dose group administered TQ-SeNP at the 48th hour compared to that in the control group. However, it was not significant. The novel nanoparticle showed an antiproliferative effect in endometrial cancer cells.

To forecast the biological activity of these compounds, we employed machine learning (ML) models. Additionally, an automated process involving the deconstruction and reconstruction of molecular building blocks leads to the generation of novel compounds. Subsequently, the ML models were utilized to predict the biological activity of the designed compounds, and the t-SNE method was employed to visualize the chemical space covered by the novel compounds. A meticulous selection process identified the most promising compounds, and their potential for synthesis was assessed, offering valuable guidance to experimental chemists in their investigative endeavors.

However, its precise function in pan-cancer is still unclear. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of its role in cancer, we performed a thorough bioinformatics analysis. To conduct our analysis, we gathered data from multiple sources, including RNA sequencing and clinical data from the TCGA database, protein expression data from the UALCAN and HPA databases, and single-cell expression data from the CancerSEA database. Additionally, we utilized TISIDB to investigate the interaction between the tumor and the immune system. To assess the impact of NTMT1 on the proliferation of SNU1076 cells, we performed a CCK8 assay. We also employed cellular immunofluorescence to detect DNA damage and used flow cytometry to measure tumor cell apoptosis. Our analysis revealed that NTMT1 was significantly overexpressed in various types of tumors and that high levels of NTMT1 were associated with poor survival outcomes. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that NTMT1 may contribute to tumor development and progression by regulating pathways involved in cell proliferation and immune response. In addition, we found that knockdown of NTMT1 expression led to reduced cell proliferation, increased DNA damage, and enhanced apoptosis in HNSCC cells. High expression of NTMT1 in tumors is associated with poor prognosis. The underlying regulatory mechanism of NTMT1 in cancer is complex, and it may be involved in both the promotion of tumor development and the inhibition of the tumor immune microenvironment.",

This study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of Sema4A in LC. Firstly, Sema4A expression was analyzed by the available dataset and detected in human normal bronchial epithelial cell line (HBE) and LC cell line (NCI-H460). Then, LC cells were transfected with Sema4A siRNA, and the cells were stimulated by PlexinB1, PlexinB2, PlexinD1 blocking antibodies, IgG antibody, BAY 11-7082 (an inhibitor for NF-\u03baB pathway) and Sema4A-Fc protein, alone or in combination. After transfection, PlexinB1 mRNA expression was analyzed. Next, the biological functions, including proliferative, migratory, invasive abilities and viability of the cells were detected by colony formation, scratch, Transwell and MTT assays, respectively. NF-\u03baB, Stat3 and MAPK protein expressions were determined by western blot. Furthermore, the secretion of IL-6 in LC cells was tested by ELISA. Sema4A was highly expressed in LC tissues and cells, could activate the NF-\u03baB pathway and upregulate PlexinB1 mRNA expression. Furthermore, we observed that Sema4A knockdown suppressed the biological functions of NCI-H460 cells, while Sema4A-Fc protein reversed the situation. However, Sema4A-induced biological functions and activation in the NF-\u03baB pathway were inhibited by PlexinB1 blocking antibody.

        "AbstractText": "The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the healthcare and the disease management of patients affected by non-communicable diseases (NCDs), by exploring, specifically, the obstacles encountered in the access to healthcare services during the latest phase of the pandemic. This cross-sectional study was carried out among subjects attending the anti-SARS-CoV2 vaccination clinic in a Teaching Hospital of Southern Italy. To be included in the study, subjects had to be affected by at least one NCD, such as diabetes, hypertension, respiratory and heart diseases, renal and liver chronic conditions, immunodeficiency disorders due to cancer, or being kidney or liver transplant recipients. Among the 553 subjects who completed the questionnaire, the 39.4% (95% IC\u2009=\u200935.3-43.6) experienced obstacles in the access to healthcare services in the six months prior to the enrollment. The most frequent canceled/postponed healthcare services were the visits for routine checks for NCDs (60.6, 95% IC\u2009=\u200953.9-67), control visits of more complex diseases as cancer or transplantation (17.3, 95% IC\u2009=\u200912.6-22.8), and scheduled surgery (11.5, 95% IC\u2009=\u20097.7-16.4). The patients who experienced canceled/postponed healthcare services were significantly more likely to suffer from 3 or more NCDs (p\u2009=\u20090.042), to be diabetics (p\u2009=\u20090.038), to have immunodeficiency disorders (p\u2009=\u20090.028) and to have consulted GP at least once (p\u2009=\u20090.004). Our results appear to be fundamental for guiding the choices of providers in order to concentrate organizational efforts to recover and reschedule missed appointments, where applicable, of the most fragile patients by virtue of age and chronic conditions.",

        "AbstractText": "To evaluate the current status of trial registration on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR). In this descriptive study, a multi-dimensional grouping analysis was conducted to estimate trends in the annual trial registration, geographical distribution, sources of funding, targeted diseases, and trial subtypes. We have analyzed all clinical trial records (over 30,000) registered on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) from 2007 to 2020 executed in China. The main outcome was the baseline characteristics of registered trials. These trials were categorized and analyzed based on geographical distribution, year of implementation, disease type, resource and funding type, trial duration, trial phase, and the type of experimental approach. From 2008 to 2017, a consistent upward trend in clinical trial registrations was observed, showing an average annual growth rate of 29.2%. The most significant year-on-year (yoy%) growth in registrations occurred in 2014 (62%) and 2018 (68.5%). Public funding represented the predominant source of funding in the Chinese healthcare system. The top five ChiCTR registration sites for all disease types were highly populated urban regions of China, including Shanghai (5,658 trials, 18%), Beijing (5,127 trials, 16%), Guangdong (3,612 trials, 11%), Sichuan (2,448 trials, 8%), and Jiangsu (2,196 trials, 7%). Trials targeting neoplastic diseases accounted for the largest portion of registrations, followed by cardio/cerebrovascular disease (CCVD) and orthopedic diseases-related trials. The largest proportions of registration trial duration were 1-2\u2009years, less than 1\u2009year, and 2-3\u2009years (at 27.36, 26.71, and 22.46%). In the case of the research phase, the top three types of all the registered trials are exploratory research, post-marketing drugs, and clinical trials of new therapeutic technology. Oncological and cardiovascular diseases receive the highest share of national public funding for medical clinical trial-based research in China. Publicly funded trials represent a major segment of the ChiCTR registry, indicating the dominating role of public governance in this health research sector. Furthermore, the growing number of analyzed records reflect the escalation of clinical research activities in China. The tendency to distribute funding resources toward exceedingly populated areas with the highest incidence of oncological and cardiovascular diseases reveals an aim to reduce the dominating disease burden in the urban conglomerates in China.",

        "AbstractText": "Owing to advances in diagnostic technology, the diagnosis of T1 colorectal cancers (CRCs) continues to increase. However, the optimal management of T1 CRCs in the Western Hemisphere remains unclear due to limited population-based data directly comparing the efficacy of endoscopic therapy (ET) and surgical resection (SR). The purpose of this study was to report outcome data from a large Western cohort of patients who underwent ET or SR for early CRCs. The SEER-18 database was used to identify patients with T1 CRCs diagnosed from 2004 to 2018 treated with ET or SR. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to identify variables related to lymph node metastasis (LNM). Rates of ET and 1-year relative survival were calculated for each year. Effect of ET or SR on overall survival and cancer-specific survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier method stratified by tumor size and site. A total of 28,430 T1 CRCs patients were identified from 2004 to 2018 in US, with 22.7% undergoing ET and 77.3% undergoing SR. The incidence of T1 CRCs was 6.15 per 100,000 person-years, with male patients having a higher incidence. Left-sided colon was the most frequent location of tumors. The utilization of ET increased significantly from 2004 to 2018, with no significant change in 1-year relative survival rate. Predictors of LNM were age at diagnosis, sex, race, tumor size, histology, grade, and location. The 5-year relative survival rates were 91.4 and 95.4% for ET and SR, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that OS and CSS were similar between ET and SR in T1N0M0 left-sided colon cancers with tumors 2\u2009cm or less and in rectal cancers with tumors 1\u2009cm or less. Our study showed that ET was feasible and safe for patients with left-sided T1N0M0 colon cancers and tumors of 2\u2009cm or less, as well as T1N0M0 rectal cancers and tumors of 1\u2009cm or less. Therefore, the over- and under-use of ET should be avoided by carefully selecting patients based on tumor size and site.",

        "AbstractText": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is performed worldwide to treat blood cancer and other life-threatening blood disorders. As successful transplantation requires an HLA-compatible donor, unrelated donor centers and registries have been established worldwide to identify donors for patients without a family match. Ethnic minorities are underrepresented in large donor registries. Matching probabilities are higher when donors and patients share the same ethnic background, making it desirable to increase the diversity of the global donor pool by recruiting donors in new regions. Here, we report the establishment and the first 5\u2009years of operation of the first unrelated stem cell donor center in Chile, a high-income country in South America with a population of over 19 million. We used online and in-person donor recruitment practices through patient appeals and donor drives in companies, universities, the armed forces, and public services. After confirmatory typing donors were subjected to medical work-up and cleared for donation. We recruited almost 170,000 donors in 5\u2009years. There were 1,488 requests received for confirmatory typing and donor availability checks, of which 333 resulted in medical work-up, leading to 194 stem cell collections. Products were shipped to Chile (48.5%) and abroad. Even when the COVID-19 pandemic challenged our activities, the number of donors recruited and shipped stem cell products remained steady. In Chile there was an almost 8-fold increase in unrelated donor transplantation activity from 16 procedures in 2016-2018 to 124 procedures in 2019-2021, mainly for pediatric patients following the center's establishment. We estimate that 49.6% of Chilean patients would find at least one matched unrelated donor in the global DKMS donor pool. Establishing a DKMS donor center in Chile has significantly increased donor availability for Chilean patients and contributed to an increase of unrelated donor stem cell transplant activity.",

Patients with lung cancer who received thoracic radiation at a total dose of \u226545 Gray between October 2017 and December 2022 were enrolled in this study. We retrospectively evaluated the factors influencing grade 2 or higher RP. A total of 320 patients were enrolled in this study; 62 patients were identified as angiotensin receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor users. Additionally, 99 patients (30.9%) had grade 2 or higher RP, and the incidence in the renin-angiotensin system inhibitor group was 17.7% (11 out of 62 patients). Patients in the renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) group were older and had a higher percentage of males, lower percentage of ECOG score 0, higher percentage of hypertension, and higher percentage of adenocarcinoma than those in the non-RASi group. ECOG score [hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20091.69, p\u2009=\u20090.009], history of smoking (HR\u2009=\u20091.76, p\u2009=\u20090.049), mean dose (HR\u2009=\u20093.63, p\u2009=\u20090.01), and RASi (HR\u2009=\u20090.3, p\u2009=\u20090.003) were independent predictive factors for RP. All subgroups benefited from RASi. This study showed that oral RASi administration has the potential to mitigate the incidence of grade 2 or higher RP in patients with lung cancer undergoing thoracic radiotherapy.

Despite the differences, the involvement of family caregivers is fundamental in both High-Income Countries (HICs) and Low-Income Countries (LICs). The lack of formal support in LICs implies that educational interventions to support family caregivers in this region could be more complex and urgently needed than in HICs. To comprehend the existing situation and identify the gaps in LICs, using HICs as a benchmark standard and conducting a review comparing educational interventions in both regions is essential. To identify and compare the existing implementation of education for family caregivers of patients with advanced cancer in LICs and HICs. An integrative review guideline by Whittemore and Knafl was followed. Interventional studies related to education for family caregivers providing care for adult patients with cancer were included, and review articles were excluded. Data were obtained from PubMed, EBSCO, ProQuest, and ClinicalKey. The search was conducted on 18 November 2021 and updated on 9 August 2023. Data reduction, data comparison, conclusion drawing, and data verification were conducted. Out of the 11 studies included, nine were randomized controlled trials, and two were quasi-experimental studies. Among them, seven (63%) were conducted in HICs, and four (37%) were carried out in LICs. In both regions, the psychological aspect was the most commonly addressed subject in palliative care education for family caregivers. However, in LICs, no articles specifically addressed the social and spiritual aspects of family caregivers' education. Research conducted in LICs mostly involved nurses, while studies in HICs included a more diverse range of healthcare professionals. Typically, these programs required two to three sessions, with 30-60 minutes duration for 3-12 weeks. The social and spiritual aspects can be integrated into family caregivers' training programs in LICs in the near future. Nurses, as an integral part of the multidisciplinary team, are capable of contributing to the development of educational programs for family caregivers, especially in resource-limited countries where patients rely heavily on their caregivers and relatives.

        "AbstractText": "Olaparib, a poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor has demonstrated promising efficacy in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) carrying breast cancer gene (BRCA) mutations. However, its impact on BRCA wild-type (BRCAwt) TNBC is limited. Hence, it is crucial to sensitize BRCAwt TNBC cells to olaparib for effective clinical practice. Novobiocin, a DNA polymerase theta (POL\u03b8) inhibitor, exhibits sensitivity towards BRCA-mutated cancer cells that have acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors. Although both of these DNA repair inhibitors demonstrate therapeutic efficacy in BRCA-mutated cancers, their nanomedicine formulations' antitumor effects on wild-type cancer remain unclear. Furthermore, ensuring effective drug accumulation and release at the cancer site is essential for the clinical application of olaparib. Herein, we designed a progressively disassembled nanosystem of DNA repair inhibitors as a novel strategy to enhance the effectiveness of olaparib in BRCAwt TNBC. The nanosystem enabled synergistic delivery of two DNA repair inhibitors olaparib and novobiocin, within an ultrathin silica framework interconnected by disulfide bonds. The designed nanosystem demonstrated remarkable capabilities, including long-term molecular storage and specific drug release triggered by the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, the nanosystem exhibited potent inhibitory effects on cell viability, enhanced accumulation of DNA damage, and promotion of apoptosis in BRCAwt TNBC cells. Additionally, the nanosystem effectively accumulated within BRCAwt TNBC, leading to significant growth inhibition and displaying vascular regulatory abilities as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our results provided the inaugural evidence showcasing the potential of a progressively disassembled nanosystem of DNA repair inhibitors, as a promising strategy for the treatment of BRCA wild-type triple-negative breast cancer.",

However, delivering nucleic acid cargos by cell membrane-based nanoparticles is difficult owing to the strong negative charge of the cell membrane fraction. In this study, we developed a cancer cell membrane-based drug delivery system, the cMDS, for efficient siRNA delivery. Meanwhile, the cancer-specific immune response stimulated by the gene vector itself could offer synergistic anti-cancer ability. The cMDS was prepared by ultrasound, and its transfection efficiency and anti-cancer ability were examined using cultures of CT26 cells. MTT and red blood cell hemolysis tests were performed to assess the safety of cMDS, while its targeted gene delivery and strong immune stimulation were investigated in a subcutaneous tumor model. Moreover, the detailed anti-cancer immune stimulation mechanisms of cMDS are uncovered by protein chip analysis. The cMDS was spherical core-shell structure. It showed high transfection efficiency and anti-cancer ability in vitro. In animal experiments, intravenously administered cMDS/siStat3 complex efficiently suppress the growth of colon cancer. Moreover, the result of protein chip analysis suggested that cMDS affect the migration and chemotaxis of immune cells.

The study enrolled 854 eligible elderly patients with lung cancer who underwent sub-lobectomy or lobectomy. A clinical prediction model for the probability of PPCs was developed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Furthermore, data from one center were used to derive the model, and data from another were used for external validation. The model's discriminatory capability, predictive accuracy, and clinical usefulness were assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis, respectively. Among the eligible elderly patients with lung cancer, 214 (25.06%) developed pulmonary complications after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, surgical procedure, operative time, forced expiratory volume in one second, and the carbon monoxide diffusing capacity of the lung were independent predictors of PPCs and were included in the final model. The areas under the ROC curves (AUC) of the training and validation sets were 0.844 and 0.796, respectively. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the generalizability of the predictive model, with an average AUC value of 0.839. The calibration curve showed good consistency between the observed and predicted probabilities. The proposed nomogram showed good net benefit with a relatively wide range of threshold probabilities.

The histological and molecular features of PCas with MSI/dMMR are incompletely described. Thus, we sought to identify the characteristics of PCas with MSI/dMMR. We analyzed 1,141 primary treatment-naive PCas by MMR-related protein immunohistochemistry (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6). We identified eight cases exhibiting MSI/dMMR (0.7%, 8/1141). Of these, six tumors had both MSH2 and MSH6 protein loss, one had both MLH1 and PMS2 protein loss, and one had only MSH6 loss. Histologically, MSI/dMMR-PCas frequently demonstrated high histological grade (Grade Group 4 or 5), ductal/intraductal histology (6/8 cases), pleomorphic giant-cell features (4/8 cases), and conspicuous tumor lymphocytic infiltration (8/8 cases). Polymerase chain reaction-based analysis of seven MSI/dMMR tumors revealed two MSI-H tumors with loss of both MSH2 and MSH6 proteins. Subsequently, the seven cases underwent next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis with a highly validated targeted panel; four were MSI. All cases had a high tumor mutation burden (median: 45.3 mutations/Mb). Overall, the MSI/dMMR-PCas showed a high frequency of DNA damage-repair pathway gene changes, including five with pathogenic somatic or germline MMR gene mutations. Activating mutations in the MAPK pathway, PI3K pathway, and WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway were common. TMPRSS2::ERG rearrangement was identified in one case (1/7, 14.3%). Several pathological features are associated with MSI/dMMR in PCas. Identification of these features may help to select patients for genetic screening. As MSI/dMMR-PCas are enriched for actionable mutations, patients should be offered NGS to guide standard-of-care treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Up till the present moment, breast cancer is still the leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide. Although the treatment methods and protocols for breast cancer are constantly improving, the long-term prognosis of patients is still not optimistic due to the complex heterogeneity of the disease, multi-organ metastasis, chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance. As a newly discovered class of non-coding RNAs, ncRNAs play an important role in various cancers. Especially in breast cancer, lncRNAs have received extensive attention and have been confirmed to regulate cancer progression through a variety of pathways. Meanwhile, the study of epigenetic modification, including DNA methylation, RNA methylation and histone modification, has developed rapidly in recent years, which has greatly promoted the attention to the important role of non-coding RNAs in breast cancer. In this review, we carefully and comprehensively describe the interactions between several major classes of epigenetic modifications and ncRNAs, as well as their different subsequent biological effects, and discuss their potential for practical clinical applications.",

        "AbstractText": "Sex-related discrepancies in the prognosis of oral cancer patients have not been clarified. This study aimed to assess survival outcomes and potential prognostic factors in female and male patients with oral cancer. A retrospective search of the TriNetX network (TriNetX, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA) was conducted to identify patients diagnosed with oral cancer (International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes C02-C06), within the past 20\u2009years from the access date April 21, 2023. Patients were categorized according to sex (female vs. male). Following matching for age and risk factors such as nicotine dependence and alcohol abuse, Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed and risk, odds, and hazard ratios were calculated. Outcome variables were five-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Additionally, the female and male patient cohort were compared with regard to the novel diagnosis of depression (depressive episode, major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder) after the tumor diagnosis. A total of 77,348 patients were assessed. After propensity score matching, 26,578 male and 26,578 female patients were included in each group (mean age 63 years). DFS (71.92% in females vs. 68.29% in males; hazard ratio (HR) 0.870; p < 0.001) and OS (77.08% in females vs. 71.74% in males; HR 0.793; p < 0.001) were significantly higher in the female cohort. However, in patients diagnosed with depression after the initial cancer diagnosis (N = 4,824), survival was worse in female patients compared to male patients (82.48% in females vs. 86.10% in males; HR 1.341; p < 0.001). This retrospective case-control study showed that females with oral cancer had a better DFS and OS than males. However, survival in females with a newly diagnosed depression after the oral cancer diagnosis was worse compared to those of male oral cancer patients. Depression may be a relevant prognostic factor that contributes to sex disparities in oral cancer patients.",

In recent years, in the field of molecular pathology, there has been a growing focus on the role of intra-tumoral microbial communities and metabolic alterations in tumor cells. However, the precise mechanism through which microbiota and their metabolites influence TNBC remains unclear and warrants further investigation. In this study, we analyzed the microbial community composition in various subtypes of breast cancer through 16S rRNA MiSeq sequencing of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. Notably, Turicibacter, a microbe associated with cancer response, exhibited a significantly higher abundance in TNBC. Similarly, mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis revealed substantial differences in specific metabolites, such as nutriacholic, pregnanetriol, and cortol. Furthermore, we observed significant correlations between the intra-tumoral microbiome, clinicopathological characteristics, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 expression(HER2). Three microbial taxa (Cytophagaceae, Conexibacteraceae, and Flavobacteriaceae) were associated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes(TILs), which are indicative of antitumor immunity. This study creatively utilized FFPE tissue samples to assess intra-tumoral microbial communities and their related metabolic correlations, presenting avenues for the identification of novel diagnostic biomarkers, the development of therapeutic strategies, and the early clinical diagnosis of TNBC.",

Currently, clinical data with regards to its prognosis and treatment is limited, and there is no optimal treatment method. The case presented involves a proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) and microsatellite-stable (MSS) Colorectal cancer (CRC) patient with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) located transversely in the colon. Based on the imaging assessment, the tumor infiltration depth is classified as T4. After receiving 4 cycles of neoadjuvant treatment with oxaliplatin and capecitabine (XELOX), the patients were evaluated for partial response (PR) in 2 cycles and stable disease (SD) in 4 cycles. The patient underwent a right hemicolectomy and received postoperative paclitaxel/cisplatin (TC) adjuvant chemotherapy. After 23 months, a systemic examination revealed abdominal metastasis. A needle biopsy was conducted on the detected abdominal metastases, with the resulting pathology indicating the presence of metastatic SCC. The individual exhibited expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and a mutation in the TP53 gene. Considering the patient's disease recurrence based on medical history, a treatment plan was formulated. This involved Sintilimab plus Cetuximab and the combination of leucovorin, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) regimen. The patient received four cycles of treatment with an efficacy evaluation of SD- and seven cycles of treatment with an efficacy evaluation of SD+, which resulted in a progression-free survival (PFS) duration of 7 months. This case study presents the conventional XELOX chemotherapy protocol, which has shown limited effectiveness, and highlights the favorable results achieved by implementing the TC adjuvant chemotherapy regimen in individuals diagnosed with primary colonic SCC. Furthermore, combining immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with other therapies for patients with advanced disease is anticipated to provide an extended duration of survival.",

        "AbstractText": "In the early stages of carcinogenesis, the transformed cells become \"invisible\" to the immune system. From this moment on, the evolution of the tumor depends essentially on the genotype of the primitive cancer cells and their subsequent genetic drift. The role of the immune system in blocking tumor progression from the earliest stages is largely underestimated because by the time tumors are clinically detectable, the immune system has already completely failed its task. Therefore, a clinical treatment capable of restoring the natural anti-tumor role of the immune system could prove to be the \"ultimate weapon\" against cancer. Herein, we propose a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of solid cancer that exploits the capability of activated monocytes to transfer major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) molecules bound to antigenic peptides to cancer cells using microvesicles as cargo, making tumor cells target of a \"natural\" CD8+ T lymphocyte cytotoxic response.",

Patients with prostate cancer diagnosed from January 1, 1975 to December 31, 2019 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database were extracted by SEER stat software for epidemiological trend analysis. General clinical information and follow-up data were also collected from 105 135 patients with pathologically diagnosed prostate cancer from January 1, 2010 to December 1, 2019. The factors affecting patient-specific survival were analyzed by Cox regression, and the factors with the greatest influence on specific survival were selected by stepwise regression method, and nomogram was constructed. The model was evaluated by calibration plots, ROC curves, Decision Curve Analysis and C-index. There was no significant change in the age-adjusted incidence of prostate cancer from 1975 to 2019, with an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of 0.45 (95% CI:-0.87~1.80). Among the tumor grade, the most significant increase in the incidence of G2 prostate cancer was observed, with an AAPC of 2.99 (95% CI:1.47~4.54); the most significant decrease in the incidence of G4 prostate cancer was observed, with an AAPC of -10.39 (95% CI:-13.86~-6.77). Among the different tumor stages, the most significant reduction in the incidence of localized prostate cancer was observed with an AAPC of -1.83 (95% CI:-2.76~-0.90). Among different races, the incidence of prostate cancer was significantly reduced in American Indian or Alaska Native and Asian or Pacific Islander, with an AAPC of -3.40 (95% CI:-3.97~-2.82) and -2.74 (95% CI:-4.14~-1.32), respectively. Among the different age groups, the incidence rate was significantly increased in 15-54 and 55-64 age groups with AAPC of 4.03 (95% CI:2.73~5.34) and 2.50 (95% CI:0.96~4.05), respectively, and significantly decreased in \u226585 age group with AAPC of -2.50 (95% CI:-3.43~-1.57). In addition, age, tumor stage, race, PSA and gleason score were found to be independent risk factors affecting prostate cancer patient-specific survival. Age, tumor stage, PSA and gleason score were most strongly associated with prostate cancer patient-specific survival by stepwise regression screening, and nomogram prediction model was constructed using these factors. The Concordance indexes are 0.845 (95% CI:0.818~0.872) and 0.835 (95% CI:0.798~0.872) for the training and validation sets, respectively, and the area under the ROC curves (AUC) at 3, 6, and 9 years was 0.7 or more for both the training and validation set samples. The calibration plots indicated a good agreement between the predicted and actual values of the model. Although there was no significant change in the overall incidence of prostate cancer in this study, significant changes occurred in the incidence of prostate cancer with different characteristics. In addition, the nomogram prediction model of prostate cancer-specific survival rate constructed based on four factors has a high reference value, which helps physicians to correctly assess the patient-specific survival rate and provides a reference basis for patient diagnosis and prognosis evaluation.",

A total of 233 consecutive patients diagnosed with GISTs at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2013 to August 2018 were included in this study. The prevalence and mutation landscape of exon 11 in KIT was presented. The clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis among the different mutation subtypes were analyzed. All the statistical analyses were performed by SPSS22.0. Somatic mutational analysis indicated that point mutations were the most frequently detected mutations followed by deletions & compound mutations and insertion and tandem duplication mutations in the stomach. Point mutations showed a low mitotic count and a high risk of recurrence, and deletions and compound mutations have a high mitotic count while insertions and tandem duplication mutations showed a low mitotic count with an intermediate recurrence risk. Point mutations and deletions frequently occurred in sequence region codons 550-560 of exon 11, while compound mutations, insertion, and tandem duplication were mainly detected in codons 557-559, 572-580, and 577-581, respectively. The multi-variation analysis demonstrated that tumor diameter and high recurrence risk groups had worse prognostic values. However, mutation types were not significant predictors of relapse-free survival (RFS) in GISTs. Survival analysis suggested no significant difference in RFS between the 557/558 deletion and the other deletions. This study suggested that mutations in exon 11 of the KIT gene were common with intermediate/high recurrence risk in GISTs patients. Tumor diameter \u22655 cm, and deletions mutations might predict a worse prognosis.",

BC patients with 70-79 years of age, stage T1-2N0-1M0, undergoing BCS were screened in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database between 2010 and 2015. The clinicopathological characteristics were balanced with propensity-score matching (PSM) method. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the impact of adjuvant RT on BC patients. Ultimately, 12,310 patients treated with adjuvant RT and 4837 patients treated with no RT, were involved in the analysis. Overall, patients treated with adjuvant RT was associated with a better breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) (HR: 1.980 [1.596- 2.456], P < 0.001) and overall survival (OS) (HR: 2.214 [1.966- 2.494], P < 0.001) than those who did not undergo RT. After 1:1 PSM, adjuvant RT still performed advantage in both BCSS (HR: 1.918 [1.439- 2.557], P < 0.001) and OS (HR: 2.235 [1.904- 2.624], P < 0.001). In the multivariate COX analysis of BCSS, widowed, divorced and separated patients, tumor grade III, T2 stage, N1 stage, no RT, molecular subtypes with luminal B and triple negative were associated with a shorter BCSS (P < 0.05). In the multivariate COX analysis of OS, age \u226574 years, widowed, divorced and separated patients, tumor grade II/III, T2 stage, no RT, no chemotherapy, molecular subtypes with triple negative were associated with a shorter OS (P < 0.05).

However, metastasis to the lung from a low-grade and early-stage endometrial endometrioid carcinoma (EEC) is extremely rare. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately differentiate between primary pulmonary malignancy and extra-thoracic malignancy presenting as metastatic disease, and flexible bronchoscopy with tissue acquisition plays a key role in this process. Despite its importance, there is limited literature available on the cytology of metastatic endometrial carcinoma in liquid-based cytology of bronchial brush (BB). In this article, we present two rare cases of lung metastasis from low-grade and early-stage EEC, along with a detailed analysis of the cytologic features observed in BB samples. These cases highlight the significance of cytological and histological pathology, complemented by immunohistochemistry (ICH) analysis, in the diagnosis and management of EEC patients. Pathologists should pay close attention to these aspects, while gynecologists need to be mindful of the follow-up and management of early-stage, low-grade EEC patients.

Previous studies had shown that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection might serve as a risk factor for breast cancer, while some studies failed to find such an association. In this study, we presented a first attempt to capture and clarify this clinical debate via a cumulative analysis (registration ID: CRD42023445888). After systematically searching and excluding the irrelevant publications, five case-control or cohort studies were finally included. The synthetic effect from the eligible studies showed that patients with HCV infection had a significantly higher prevalence of breast cancer than non-HCV infected general population (combined HR= 1.382, 95%CI: 1.129 to 1.692, P=0.002). There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity during this pooled analysis (I2\u00a0=\u00a013.2%, P=0.33). The sensitivity analyses confirmed the above findings. No significant publication bias was observed among the included studies. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for this relationship might be associated with persistent infection/inflammation, host immune response, and the modulation of HCV-associated gene expression. Though the causal association between HCV infection and breast cancer did not seem quite as strong, screening for HCV might enable the early detection of breast cancer and help to prevent the progression of the disease. Since the topic of this study remains a matter of clinical debate, further studies are still warranted to validate this potential association. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier CRD42023445888.",

Yet, current radiation oncology practice does not adapt RT dose for individual patients, despite wide interpatient variability in radiosensitivity and accompanying treatment response. We have previously shown that mechanistic mathematical modeling of tumor volume dynamics can simulate volumetric response to RT for individual patients and estimation personalized RT dose for optimal tumor volume reduction. However, understanding the implications of the choice of the underlying RT response model is critical when calculating personalized RT dose. In this study, we evaluate the mathematical implications and biological effects of 2 models of RT response on dose personalization: (1) cytotoxicity to cancer cells that lead to direct tumor volume reduction (DVR) and (2) radiation responses to the tumor microenvironment that lead to tumor carrying capacity reduction (CCR) and subsequent tumor shrinkage. Tumor growth was simulated as logistic growth with pre-treatment dynamics being described in the proliferation saturation index (PSI). The effect of RT was simulated according to each respective model for a standard schedule of fractionated RT with 2 Gy weekday fractions. Parameter sweeps were evaluated for the intrinsic tumor growth rate and the radiosensitivity parameter for both models to observe the qualitative impact of each model parameter. We then calculated the minimum RT dose required for locoregional tumor control (LRC) across all combinations of the full range of radiosensitvity and proliferation saturation values. Both models estimate that patients with higher radiosensitivity will require a lower RT dose to achieve LRC. However, the two models make opposite estimates on the impact of PSI on the minimum RT dose for LRC: the DVR model estimates that tumors with higher PSI values will require a higher RT dose to achieve LRC, while the CCR model estimates that higher PSI values will require a lower RT dose to achieve LRC. Ultimately, these results show the importance of understanding which model best describes tumor growth and treatment response in a particular setting, before using any such model to make estimates for personalized treatment recommendations.",

        "AbstractText": "The onset, development, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer involve intricate interactions among various factors, spanning the realms of mechanics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Within our bodies, cells are subject to a variety of forces such as gravity, magnetism, tension, compression, shear stress, and biological static force/hydrostatic pressure. These forces are perceived by mechanoreceptors as mechanical signals, which are then transmitted to cells through a process known as mechanical transduction. During tumor development, invasion and metastasis, there are significant biomechanical influences on various aspects such as tumor angiogenesis, interactions between tumor cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM), interactions between tumor cells and other cells, and interactions between tumor cells and the circulatory system and vasculature. The tumor microenvironment comprises a complex interplay of cells, ECM and vasculature, with the ECM, comprising collagen, fibronectins, integrins, laminins and matrix metalloproteinases, acting as a critical mediator of mechanical properties and a key component within the mechanical signaling pathway. The vasculature exerts appropriate shear forces on tumor cells, enabling their escape from immune surveillance, facilitating their dissemination in the bloodstream, dictating the trajectory of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and playing a pivotal role in regulating adhesion to the vessel wall. Tumor biomechanics plays a critical role in tumor progression and metastasis, as alterations in biomechanical properties throughout the malignant transformation process trigger a cascade of changes in cellular behavior and the tumor microenvironment, ultimately culminating in the malignant biological behavior of the tumor.",

By August 11th, 2022, 108 out of 114 (94.7%) patients had received at least three doses of COVID-19 vaccine and six patients at least two doses. More than half of the surveyed patients were >55y (52.6%; mean: 55.1y, range 29-86y). Patients with breast cancer (n= 83) had early (59.0%) or metastatic cancer (41.0%); gynecological cancers (n=31) also included metastatic (54.8%) and non-metastatic cancer (45.2%). 83.3% of the patients stated that COVID-19 vaccination had a positive impact on their HR-QoL. Furthermore, 29 patients (25.4%) had undergone a COVID-19 infection. These patients reported self-limiting symptoms for a median duration of 5.9 days and no hospital admissions were registered. Our study demonstrates that vaccination against COVID-19 was positively associated with HR-QoL in patients with breast and gynecological cancer. Furthermore, vaccinated patients who underwent COVID-19 disease experienced only self-limiting symptoms.",

        "AbstractText": "This study was designed to investigate the clinical value of a simplified five-item frailty index (sFI) for predicting short- and long-term outcomes in older patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) patients after radical nephroureterectomy (RNU). This retrospective study included 333 patients (aged \u226565\u2009years) with UTUC. Patients were classified into five groups: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 3+, according to sFI score. The variable importance and minimum depth methods were used to screen for significant variables, and univariable and multivariable logistic regression models applied to investigated the relationships between significant variables and postoperative complications. Survival differences between groups were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate risk factors associated with overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Further, we developed a nomogram based on clinicopathological features and the sFI. The area under the curve (AUC), Harrel's concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the nomogram. Of 333 cases identified, 31.2% experienced a Clavien-Dindo grade of 2 or greater complication. Random forest-logistic regression modeling showed that sFI significantly influenced the incidence of postoperative complications in older patients (AUC= 0.756). Compared with patients with low sFI score, those with high sFI scores had significantly lower OS and CSS (p < 0.001). Across all patients, the random survival forest-Cox regression model revealed that sFI score was an independent prognostic factor for OS and CSS, with AUC values of 0.815 and 0.823 for predicting 3-year OS and CSS, respectively. The nomogram developed was clinically valuable and had good ability to discriminate abilities for high-risk patients. Further, we developed a survival risk classification system that divided all patients into high-, moderate-, and low-risk groups based on total nomogram points for each patient. A simple five-item frailty index may be considered a prognostic factor for the prognosis and postoperative complications of UTUC following RNU. By using this predictive model, clinicians may increase their accuracy in predicting complications and prognosis and improve preoperative decision-making.",

Hospital-based ALL cases (n = 443) diagnosed in children <19 years old from the Metropolitan Zones of Merida and San Luis Potosi, the State of Mexico, and Tijuana were analyzed (2015-2020). ALL cases were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology. ALL clusters were identified by Kernel Density, and excess risk was estimated. Data of particulate matter \u22642.5 \u00b5m (PM2.5) concentrations measured by community-monitoring stations were analyzed. Geocoded datasets of benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and PM2.5 sources were analyzed to characterize patterns of exposure in ALL clusters. The survival rate for ALL ranged from 61.5% to 78.6%. Seven ALL clusters with excess risk (RR 1.4-2.3, p < 0.05) were identified. The carcinogen sources included artisanal brick kilns, gas stations, cement works, carpentry, paint, and chemical manufacturing establishments. PM2.5 levels ranged from 15 \u00b5g/m3 to 37 \u00b5g/m3 among study areas. ALL clusters were identified at the community level; the excess risk could be explained by small-scale carcinogen sources. The levels of PM2.5 in outdoor air ranged from 3 to 6 times above the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines. Healthcare providers must raise awareness of the increased risk of ALL in children living near sources of environmental carcinogens; cancer control and prevention strategies must be steered from a multi-sectoral and multi-action perspective to protect children's health.",

A single-center open-label phase I clinical trial had been conducted using the system since November 2019. A patient with a localized node-negative acral malignant melanoma and the largest diameter of the tumor \u2264 15 cm who refused primary surgery and chemotherapy was enrolled. After administering boronophenylalanine (BPA), a single treatment of BNCT with the maximum dose of 18 Gy-Eq delivered to the skin was performed. The safety and efficacy of the accelerator-based BNCT system for treating localized cutaneous malignant melanoma were evaluated. The first patient with cutaneous malignant melanoma in situ on the second finger of the left hand did not develop dose-limiting toxicity in the clinical trial. After BNCT, the treatment efficacy was gradually observed, and the patient achieved PR within 6 months and CR within 12 months. Moreover, during the follow-up period of 12 months after BNCT, the patient did not exhibit a recurrence without any treatment-related grade 2 or higher adverse events. Although grade 1 adverse events of dermatitis, dry skin, skin hyperpigmentation, edema, nausea, and aching pain were noted in the patient, those adverse events were relieved without any treatment. This case report shows that the accelerator-based BNCT may become a promising treatment modality for cutaneous malignant melanoma. We expect further clinical trials to reveal the efficacy and safety of the accelerator-based BNCT for cutaneous malignant melanoma.",

In this study we investigated the interaction between PRMT1 and PRMT6, and PRMT6 was shown to be a novel substrate of PRMT1. We identified specific arginine residues of PRMT6 that are methylated by PRMT1, with R106 being the major methylation site.

Low YTHDC1 expression correlated with short patient survival, advanced pathologic stage, lymph node metastasis, basal-squamous molecular subtype, non-papillary histological type, and certain genetic mutations important to MIBC. Remarkably, YTHDC1 expression exhibited negative association with tumor-infiltrating M2 macrophage abundance in MIBC.

The development of the most conventional forms of this disease has been proposed to be conducted by two different steps influenced by different types of risk factors. The first step is led by a genetic insult that is presumably acquired before birth that transforms a healthy cell into a preleukemic one, which is maintained untransformed until the second step takes place. This necessary next step to leukemia development will be triggered by different risk factors to which children are exposed after birth. Murine models that recap the stepwise progression of B-ALL have been instrumental in identifying environmental and genetic factors that contribute to disease risk. Recent evidence from these models has demonstrated that specific environmental risk factors, such as common infections or gut microbiome dysbiosis, induce immune stress, driving the transformation of preleukemic cells, and harboring genetic alterations, into fully transformed leukemic cells. Such models serve as valuable tools for investigating the mechanisms underlying preleukemic events and can aid in the development of preventive approaches for leukemia in child. Here, we discuss the existing knowledge, learned from mouse models, of the impact of genetic and environmental risk factors on childhood B-ALL evolution and how B-ALL prevention could be reached by interfering with preleukemic cells.",

B4GALT3 is differentially expressed in tumors and adjacent normal tissues, and is correlated with clinical prognosis in several cancers, including neuroblastoma, cervical cancer, and bladder cancer. However, the exact role of B4GALT3 in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) remains unclear. Here, we aimed to elucidate the function of B4GALT3 in the TIME. To study the functions of B4GALT3 in cancer immunity, either weakly or strongly immunogenic tumor cells were subcutaneously transplanted into wild-type (WT) and B4galt3 knockout (KO) mice. Bone marrow transplantation and CD8+ T cell depletion experiments were conducted to elucidate the role of immune cells in suppressing tumor growth in B4galt3 KO mice. The cell types and gene expression in the tumor region and infiltrating CD8+ T cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and RNA sequencing. N-glycosylated proteins from WT and B4galt3 KO mice were compared using the liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based glycoproteomic approach. B4galt3 KO mice exhibited suppressed growth of strongly immunogenic tumors with a notable increase in CD8+ T cell infiltration within tumors. Notably, B4galt3 deficiency led to changes in N-glycan modification of several proteins, including integrin alpha L (ITGAL), involved in T cell activity and proliferation. In vitro experiments suggested that B4galt3 KO CD8+ T cells were more susceptible to activation and displayed increased downstream phosphorylation of FAK linked to ITGAL. Our study demonstrates that B4galt3 deficiency can potentially boost anti-tumor immune responses, largely through enhancing the influx of CD8+ T cells. B4GALT3 might be suppressing cancer immunity by synthesizing the glycan structure of molecules on the CD8+ T cell surface, as evidenced by the changes in the glycan structure of ITGAL in immune cells. Importantly, B4galt3 KO mice showed no adverse effects on growth, development, or reproduction, underscoring the potential of B4GALT3 as a promising and safe therapeutic target for cancer treatment.",

It has become obvious that pediatric glioma differs significantly from their adult counterparts, rendering extrapolations difficult. Curative options for several types of glioma are lacking, albeit ongoing research efforts and clinical trials. As already proven in the past, inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity plays an important role in the resistance to therapy and thus implicates morbidity and mortality for these patients. However, while less studied, the tumor micro-environment (TME) adds another level of heterogeneity. Knowledge gaps exist on how the TME interacts with the tumor cells and how the location of the various cell types in the TME influences tumor growth and the response to treatment. Some studies identified the presence of several (immune) cell types as prognostic factors, but often lack a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms, possibly leading to contradictory findings. Although the TME in pediatric glioma is regarded as \"cold\", several treatment options are emerging, with the TME being the primary target of treatment. Therefore, it is crucial to study the TME of pediatric glioma, so that the interactions between TME, tumoral cells and therapeutics can be better understood before, during and after treatment. In this review, we provide an overview of the available insights into the composition and role of the TME across different types of pediatric glioma.

In this study, we confirmed the importance of mesothelin and examined the relationship between mesothelin and the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in two MPM cohorts. The discovery cohort included 82 MPM cases. Tissue microarray slides were generated, and samples were processed for hematoxylin & eosin staining, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence assays. The relationship between mesothelin, biomarkers of histogenesis, histological aggressiveness, PD-L1, immune cells (CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68), and collagen type I and type V fibers was evaluated by quantitative digital analyses. The outcome was the survival time until death from disease recurrence. The exploratory cohort included 87 malignant mesothelioma (MESO) patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Most patients were male (70.7%) with a history of asbestos exposure (53.7%) and with the epithelioid subtype (89%). Surgical resection was performed in 85.4% of patients, and 14.6% received chemotherapy; 59.8% of patients died from disease extension to the mediastinum. Low tumor mesothelin expression was associated with tumor necrosis and nuclear grade 1, whereas high mesothelin expression was significantly associated with the epithelioid histotype and high density of T cells CD8+, macrophages CD68+, and collagen type I fibers. Cox multivariate analysis showed a high risk of death for non-operated patients [hazard ratio (HR), 3.42 (1.15-10.16)] with low tumor mesothelin levels [HR, 2.58 (1.09-6.10)] and high PD-L1 and low infiltration of T cells CD4+ [HR, 3.81 (1.58-9.18)]. In the exploratory cohort, low mesothelin and high COL1A1 and COL5A1 expression were associated with poor overall survival.

        "AbstractText": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) comprises a heterogeneous group of clinically aggressive tumors with high risk of recurrence and metastasis. Current pharmacological treatment options remain largely limited to chemotherapy. Despite promising results, the efficacy of immunotherapy and chemo-immunotherapy in TNBC remains limited. There is strong evidence supporting the involvement of Notch signaling in TNBC progression. Expression of Notch1 and its ligand Jagged1 correlate with poor prognosis. Notch inhibitors, including g-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), are quite effective in preclinical models of TNBC. However, the success of GSIs in clinical trials has been limited by their intestinal toxicity and potential for adverse immunological effects, since Notch plays key roles in T-cell activation, including CD8 T-cells in tumors. Our overarching goal is to replace GSIs with agents that lack their systemic toxicity and ideally, do not affect tumor immunity. We identified sulindac sulfide (SS), the active metabolite of FDA-approved NSAID sulindac, as a potential candidate to replace GSIs. We investigated the pharmacological and immunotherapeutic properties of SS in TNBC models in vitro, ex-vivo and in vivo. We confirmed that SS, a known \u03b3-secretase modulator (GSM), inhibits Notch1 cleavage in TNBC cells. SS significantly inhibited mammosphere growth in all human and murine TNBC models tested. In a transplantable mouse TNBC tumor model (C0321), SS had remarkable single-agent anti-tumor activity and eliminated Notch1 protein expression in tumors. Importantly, SS did not inhibit Notch cleavage in T- cells, and the anti-tumor effects of SS were significantly enhanced when combined with a-PD1 immunotherapy in our TNBC organoids and in vivo. Our data support further investigation of SS for the treatment of TNBC, in conjunction with chemo- or -chemo-immunotherapy. Repurposing an FDA-approved, safe agent for the treatment of TNBC may be a cost-effective, rapidly deployable therapeutic option for a patient population in need of more effective therapies.",

        "AbstractText": "The tumor microbiome (TM) has been linked to pancreatic cancer prognosis. Specific microbes can confer tumor resistance to therapies. Early knowledge of the TM at time of diagnosis would be clinically relevant for precision therapy based on microbial composition. However, it is difficult to define the TM prior to surgical resection. In this pilot feasibility study, patients underwent Endoscopic Ultrasound-Fine Needle Aspiration (EUS-FNA) biopsy of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. These samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing for characterization of the tumor bacteria and fungi. After in silico decontamination and comparison to non-matched tumor, we were able to characterize the TM in biopsies, which was comparable to the TM from surgical specimens. EUS-FNA biopsy may represent a feasible modality to characterize the pancreatic TM prior to surgical resection with proper decontamination strategies and improvements in matched controls.",

        "AbstractText": "The innate immune sensing of nucleic acids using effective immunoadjuvants is critical for increasing protective immune responses against cancer. Stimulators of interferon genes (STING) and toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists are considered promising candidates in several preclinical tumor models with the potential to be used in clinical settings. However, the effects of such treatment on tumor stroma are currently unknown. In this study, we investigated the immunotherapeutic effects of ADU-S100 as a STING agonist and CpG ODN1826 as a TLR9 agonist in a preclinical model of colon carcinoma. Tumor-bearing mice were treated intratumorally on days 10 and 16 post-tumor inoculation with ADU-S100 and CpG ODN1826. Cytokine profiles in the tumor and spleen, tumor cell apoptosis, the infiltration of immune cells, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) were evaluated to identify the immunological mechanisms after treatment. The powerful antitumor activity of single and combination treatments, the upregulation of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the tumor and spleen, and the recruitment and infiltration of the TME by immune cells revealed the synergism of immunoadjuvants in the eradication of the colon carcinoma model. Remarkably, the significant downregulation of CAFs in the TME indicated that suppression of tumorigenesis occurred after immunoadjuvant therapy. The results illustrate the potential of targeting the STING and TLR9 pathways as powerful immunoadjuvants in the treatment of preclinical colon carcinoma and the possibility of harnessing these pathways in future therapeutic approaches.",

        "AbstractText": "Origin recognition complex 6 (ORC6) is one of the six highly conserved subunit proteins required for DNA replication and is essential for maintaining genome stability during cell division. Recent research shows that ORC6 regulates the advancement of multiple cancers; however, it remains unclear what regulatory impact it has on the tumor immune microenvironment. Unpaired Wilcoxon rank sum and signed rank tests were used to analyze the differences in the expression of ORC6 in normal tissues and corresponding tumor tissues. Multiple online databases have evaluated the genetic alterations, protein expression and localization, and clinical relevance of ORC6. To evaluate the potential prognostic impact and diagnostic significance of ORC6 expression, we carried out log-rank, univariate Cox regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The ICGC-LIRI-JP cohort, CGGA-301 cohort, CGGA-325 cohort, CGGA-693 cohort, and GSE13041 cohort were used for external validation of the study findings. The associations between ORC6 expression and immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint expression, and immunotherapy cohorts was further analyzed. To explore the functional and signaling pathways related to ORC6 expression, gene set enrichment analysis was performed. To clarify the expression and function of ORC6 in hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and glioma, we conducted in vitro experiments. Expression of ORC6 is upregulated in the majority of cancer types and is associated with poor patient prognosis, notably in cases of LIHC and gliomas. In addition, ORC6 may be involved in multiple signaling pathways related to cancer progression and immune regulation. High expression of ORC6 correlates with an immunosuppressive state in the tumor microenvironment. The results of further immunotherapy cohort analysis suggested that patients in the ORC6 high-expression group benefited from immunotherapy. Inhibiting ORC6 expression suppressed the proliferative and migratory abilities of LIHC and glioma cells. High expression of ORC6 may be used as a biomarker to predict the poor prognosis of most tumor patients. The high expression of ORC6 may be involved in the regulation of the tumor immunosuppressive environment, and it is expected to become a molecular target for inhibiting tumor progression.",

After receiving Disitamab Vedotin(a novel antibody drug conjugate, ADC) and toripalimab (a PD-1 inhibitor), the patient achieved persistent PR, and the PFS exceeded 12 months up to now. Our report indicates that, despite the patient of metastatic PUC has low expression of HER2, it is still possible to benefit from Disitamab Vedotin combined with PD-1 inhibitor, which may reverse the drug resistance of PD-1 inhibitor and chemotherapy to a certain extent.

        "AbstractText": "T cell immunity plays a central role in clinical outcomes of Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and T cell-focused vaccination or cellular immunotherapy might provide enhanced protection for some immunocompromised patients. Pre-existing T cell memory recognizing SARS-CoV-2 antigens antedating COVID-19 infection or vaccination, may have developed as an imprint of prior infections with endemic non-SARS human coronaviruses (hCoVs) OC43, HKU1, 229E, NL63, pathogens of \"common cold\". In turn, SARS-CoV-2-primed T cells may recognize emerging variants or other hCoV viruses and modulate the course of subsequent hCoV infections. Cross-immunity between hCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 has not been well characterized. Here, we systematically investigated T cell responses against the immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 spike, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins and corresponding antigens from \u03b1- and \u03b2-hCoVs among vaccinated, convalescent, and unexposed subjects. Broad T cell immunity against all tested SARS-CoV-2 antigens emerged in COVID-19 survivors. In convalescent and in vaccinated individuals, SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cells reliably recognized most SARS-CoV-2 variants, however cross-reactivity against the omicron variant was reduced by approximately 47%. Responses against spike, nucleocapsid and membrane antigens from endemic hCoVs were significantly more extensive in COVID-19 survivors than in unexposed subjects and displayed cross-reactivity between \u03b1- and \u03b2-hCoVs. In some, non-SARS hCoV-specific T cells demonstrated a prominent non-reciprocal cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 antigens, whereas a distinct anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunological repertoire emerged post-COVID-19, with relatively limited cross-recognition of non-SARS hCoVs. Based on this cross-reactivity pattern, we established a strategy for in-vitro expansion of universal anti-hCoV T cells for adoptive immunotherapy. Overall, these results have implications for the future design of universal vaccines and cell-based immune therapies against SARS- and non-SARS-CoVs.",

        "AbstractText": "Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCT) is a procedure commonly used in treatment of various haematological disorders which is associated with significantly improved survival rates. However, one of its drawbacks is the possibility of development of post-transplant complications, including acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or CMV infection. Various studies suggested that NK cells and their receptors may affect the transplant outcome. In the present study, patients and donors were found to significantly differ in the distribution of the NKG2A rs7301582 genetic variants - recipients carried the C allele more often than their donors (0.975 vs 0.865, p<0.0001). Increased soluble HLA-E (sHLA-E) levels detected in recipients' serum 30 days after transplantation seemed to play a prognostic and protective role. It was observed that recipients with higher sHLA-E levels were less prone to chronic GvHD (11.65 vs 6.33 pg/mL, p=0.033) or more severe acute GvHD grades II-IV (11.07 vs 8.04 pg/mL, p=0.081). Our results also showed an unfavourable role of HLA-E donor-recipient genetic incompatibility in CMV infection development after transplantation (OR=5.92, p=0.014). Frequencies of NK cells (both CD56dim and CD56bright) expressing NKG2C were elevated in recipients who developed CMV, especially 30 and 90 days post-transplantation (p<0.03). Percentages of NKG2C+ NK cells lacking NKG2A expression were also increased in these patients. Moreover, recipients carrying a NKG2C deletion characterized with decreased frequency of NKG2C+ NK cells (p<0.05). Our study confirms the importance of NK cells in the development of post-transplant complications and highlights the effect of HLA-E and NKG2C genetic variants, sHLA-E serum concentration, as well as NKG2C surface expression on transplant outcome.",

However, its clinical efficiency is not high and not all patients benefit from it. Thus, finding the best combination strategy to expand anti-PD-1/PD-L1-based immunotherapy is now a hot research topic. The conventional use of chemotherapeutic drugs and targeted drugs inevitably leads to resistance, toxic side effects and other problems. Recent research, however, suggests that by adjusting the dosage of drugs and blocking the activation of mutational mechanisms that depend on acquired resistance, it is possible to reduce toxic side effects, activate immune cells, and reshape the immune microenvironment of lung cancer. Here, we discuss the effects of different chemotherapeutic drugs and targeted drugs on the immune microenvironment. We explore the effects of adjusting the dosing sequence and timing, and the mechanisms of such responses, and show how the effectiveness and reliability of combined immunotherapy provide improved treatment outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "The immune system, composed of organs, tissues, cells, and proteins, is the key to protecting the body from external biological attacks and inflammation. The latter occurs in several pathologies, such as cancers, type 1 diabetes, and human immunodeficiency virus infection. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry is the method of choice for diagnosing these pathologies. Under inflammatory conditions, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are partially activated and generate intracellular pathways involving Ca2+-dependent signaling cascades leading to transcription factor expression. Ca2+ signaling is typically studied by microscopy in cell lines but can present some limitations to explore human PBMCs, where flow cytometry can be a good alternative. In this review, we dived into the research field of inflammation and Ca2+ signaling in PBMCs. We aimed to investigate the structure and evolution of this field in a physio-pathological context, and then we focused our review on flow cytometry analysis of Ca2+ fluxes in PBMCs. From 1984 to 2022, 3865 articles on inflammation and Ca2+ signaling in PBMCs were published, according to The Clarivate Web of Science (WOS) database used in this review. A bibliometric study was designed for this collection and consisted of a co-citation and bibliographic coupling analysis. The co-citation analysis was performed on 133 articles: 4 clusters highlighted the global context of Ca2+ homeostasis, including chemical probe development, identification of the leading players in Ca2+ signaling, and the link with chemokine production in immune cell function. Next, the bibliographic coupling analysis combined 998 articles in 8 clusters. This analysis outlined the mechanisms of PBMC activation, from signal integration to cellular response. Further explorations of the bibliographic coupling network, focusing on flow cytometry, revealed 21 articles measuring cytosolic Ca2+ in PBMCs, with only 5 since 2016. This final query showed that Ca2+ signaling analysis in human PBMCs using flow cytometry is still underdeveloped and investigates mainly the cytosolic Ca2+ compartment. Our review uncovers remaining knowledge gaps of intracellular players involved in Ca2+ signaling in PBMCs, such as reticulum and mitochondria, and presents flow cytometry as a solid option to supplement gold-standard microscopy studies.",

The monocyte-derived DCs generated by ex vivo culture, have been used for cancer immunotherapy to eliminate tumor; however, the clinical efficacies are not sufficient, and further improvement is essential. In this study, we established a method to generate DCs using small molecule compounds for cancer immunotherapy. We observed an increase in the percentage of CD11c+I-A/I-Ehigh cells, representing DCs, by adding four small molecular inhibitors: Y27632, PD0325901, PD173074, and PD98059 (abbreviated as YPPP), in mouse bone marrow (BM) culture with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). BM-derived DCs cultured with YPPP (YPPP-DCs) showed high responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide stimulation, resulting in increased interleukin (IL) -12 production and enhanced proliferation activity when co-cultured with na\u00efve T cells compared with the vehicle control. RNA-seq analysis revealed an upregulation of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b3 associated genes increased in YPPP-DCs. In tumor models treated with anti-programmed death (PD) -1 therapies, mice injected intratumorally with YPPP-DCs as a DCs vaccine exhibited reduced tumor growth and increased survival. These findings suggested that our method would be useful for the induction of DCs that efficiently activate effector T cells for cancer immunotherapy.",

Intravesical adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) can potentially induce durable responses in bladder cancer while maximizing T cells at the tumor site. T cells infused into the bladder directly encounter immunosuppressive populations, such as myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), that can attenuate T cell responses. Intravesical instillation of gemcitabine can be used as a lymphodepleting agent to precondition the bladder microenvironment for infused T cell products. Urine samples from bladder cancer patients and healthy donors were analyzed by flow cytometry and cytometric bead array for immune profiling and cytokine quantification. MDSCs were isolated from the urine and cocultured with stimulated T cells to assess effects on proliferation. An orthotopic murine model of bladder cancer was established using the MB49-OVA cell line and immune profiling was performed. MDSCs from tumor-bearing mice were cocultured with OT-I splenocytes to assess T cell proliferation. Mice received intravesical instillation of gemcitabine and depletion of immune cells was measured via flow cytometry. Bladder tumor growth of mice treated with intravesical gemcitabine, OT-I transgenic T cells, or combination was monitored via ultrasound measurement. In comparison to healthy donors, urine specimen from bladder cancer patients show high levels of MDSCs and cytokines associated with myeloid chemotaxis, T cell chemotaxis, and inflammation. T cells isolated from healthy donors were less proliferative when cocultured with MDSCs from the urine. Orthotopic murine bladder tumors also presented with high levels of MDSCs along with enrichment of cytokines found in the patient urine samples. MDSCs isolated from spleens of tumor-bearing mice exerted suppressive effects on the proliferation of OT-I T cells. Intravesical instillation of gemcitabine reduced overall immune cells, MDSCs, and T cells in orthotopic bladder tumors. Combination treatment with gemcitabine and OT-I T cells resulted in sustained anti-tumor responses in comparison to monotherapy treatments.

Genetically-engineered T cell therapy targeting chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4), however, represents a promising treatment option, especially as both primary melanoma cells as well as metastases uniformly express CSPG4. Aiming to prevent off-tumor toxicity while maintaining a high cytolytic potential, we combined a chimeric co-stimulatory receptor (CCR) and a CSPG4-directed second-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) with moderate potency. CCRs are artificial receptors similar to CARs, but lacking the CD3\u03b6 activation element. Thus, T cells expressing solely a CCR, do not induce any cytolytic activity upon target cell binding, but are capable of boosting the CAR T cell response when both CAR and CCR engage their target antigens simultaneously. Here we demonstrate that co-expression of a CCR can significantly enhance the anti-tumor response of CSPG4-CAR T cells in vitro as well as in vivo. Importantly, this boosting effect was not dependent on co-expression of both CCR- and CAR-target on the very same tumor cell, but was also achieved upon trans activation. Finally, our data support the idea of using a CCR as a powerful tool to enhance the cytolytic potential of CAR T cells, which might open a novel therapeutic window for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.",

However, impaired immunogenicity must be expected due to the combination of chronic liver diseases (CLDs) with malignancy and anticancer treatment. In this prospective, longitudinal study, 101 patients were included, of whom 59 were patients with HBC under anticancer treatment. A cohort of patients with a past medical history of gastrointestinal cancer, of whom 28.6% had HBC without detectable active tumor disease having been off therapy for at least 12 months, served as control. Levels of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG, surrogate neutralization antibodies (sNABs), and cellular immune responses were compared. In uni- and multivariable subgroup analyses, risk factors for impaired immunogenicity were regarded. Data on rates and clinical courses of SARS-CoV-2 infections were documented. In patients with HBC under active treatment, levels of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG were significantly lower (2.55 log10 BAU/mL; 95% CI: 2.33-2.76; p < 0.01) than in patients in follow-up care (3.02 log10 BAU/mL; 95% CI: 2.80-3.25) 4 weeks after two vaccinations. Antibody levels decreased over time, and differences between the groups diminished. However, titers of SARS-CoV-2 sNAB were for a longer time significantly lower in patients with HBC under treatment (64.19%; 95% CI: 55.90-72.48; p < 0.01) than in patients in follow-up care (84.13%; 95% CI: 76.95-91.31). Underlying CLD and/or liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh A or B (less than 8 points) did not seem to further impair immunogenicity. Conversely, chemotherapy and additional immunosuppression were found to significantly reduce antibody levels. After a third booster vaccination for SARS-CoV-2, levels of total and neutralization antibodies were equalized between the groups. Moreover, cellular response rates were balanced. Clinically, infection rates with SARS-CoV-2 were low, and no severe courses were observed. Patients with active HBC showed significantly impaired immune response rates to basic vaccinations for SARS-CoV-2, especially under chemotherapy, independent of underlying cirrhotic or non-cirrhotic CLD. Although booster vaccinations balanced differences, waning immunity was observed over time and should be monitored for further recommendations. Our data help clinicians decide on individual additional booster vaccinations and/or passive immunization or antiviral treatment in patients with HBC getting infected with SARS-CoV-2.",

        "AbstractText": "Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab therapy is extremely effective in the treatment of intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with a response rate of 44%, as reported in the IMbrave150 trial. When tumor shrinkage is obtained, achieving complete response (CR) is possible in many cases using curative conversion with resection, ablation, or superselective transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with curative intent. This concept, i.e., curative conversion by combining systemic therapy and locoregional therapy, has not been reported before. This multicenter proof-of-concept study was conducted to show the value of curative conversion in immunotherapy-treated intermediate-stage HCC meeting TACE-unsuitable criteria. This study included 110 consecutive Child-Pugh A patients who received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab as first-line treatment for unresectable and TACE-unsuitable intermediate-stage HCC at seven centers in Japan. CR rate, drug-free rate, time to CR, change in liver function, efficacy in positron emission tomography (PET)-positive HCC, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed in patients who achieved CR using resection, ablation, superselective TACE with curative intent following atezolizumab plus bevacizumab or atezolizumab plus bevacizumab alone. Clinical or pathological CR was achieved in 38 patients (35%) (median observation period: 21.2 months). The modalities of curative conversion in 35 patients were as follows: resection, 7; ablation, 13; and superselective TACE, 15. Three patients achieved clinical CR with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab therapy alone. Among the 38 CR patients, 25 achieved drug-free status. PFS was not reached, and 3 patients experienced recurrence after reaching CR. Regarding OS, there were no deaths in any of the CR patients. The albumin-bilirubin score did not deteriorate after locoregional therapy or resection. Of seven PET-positive patients who achieved CR with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab followed by curative conversion, five achieved drug-free status. The achievement of CR rate by curative conversion in patients treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab as the preceding therapy for unresectable and TACE-unsuitable intermediate-stage HCC was 35%. Overall, 23% of patients achieved drug-free status and no recurrence was observed from this patient subgroup with CR and drug-free status. Thus, achieving CR and/or drug-free status should be a therapeutic goal for patients with intermediate-stage HCC without vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread.",

        "AbstractText": "Cancer immunotherapy has become an established therapeutic paradigm in oncologic therapy, but its therapeutic efficacy remains unsatisfactory in the majority of cancer patients. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the metabolically hostile tumor microenvironment (TME), characterized by acidity, deprivation of oxygen and nutrients, and accumulation of immunosuppressive metabolites, promotes the dysfunction of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) and thereby compromises the effectiveness of immunotherapy. This indicates the potential role of tumor metabolic intervention in the reinvigoration of antitumor immunity. With the merits of multiple drug codelivery, cell and organelle-specific targeting, controlled drug release, and multimodal therapy, tumor metabolism-rewriting nanomedicines have recently emerged as an attractive strategy to strengthen antitumor immune responses. This review summarizes the current progress in the development of multifunctional tumor metabolism-rewriting nanomedicines for evoking antitumor immunity. A special focus is placed on how these nanomedicines reinvigorate innate or adaptive antitumor immunity by regulating glucose metabolism, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism at the tumor site. Finally, the prospects and challenges in this emerging field are discussed.",

        "AbstractText": "Surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and brachytherapy are crucial treatments for localized deep tumors. However, imprecise tumor location often leads to issues such as positive surgical margins, extended radiotherapy target volumes, and radiation damage to healthy tissues. Reducing side effects in healthy tissue and enhancing RT efficacy are critical challenges. To address these issues, we developed a multifunctional theranostic platform using Au/Ag nanodots (Au/AgNDs) that act as a \"pilot light\" for real-time guided surgery, high-efficiency RT, and brachytherapy, achieving a strategy of killing three birds with one stone. First, dual-mode imaging of Au/AgNDs enabled precision RT, minimizing damage to adjacent normal tissue during X-ray irradiation. Au/AgNDs enhanced ionizing radiation energy deposition, increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, regulated the cell cycle, promoted DNA damage formation, and inhibited DNA repair in tumor cells, significantly improving RT efficacy. Second, in brachytherapy, precise guidance provided by dual-mode imaging addressed challenges related to non-visualization of existing interstitial brachytherapy and multiple adjustments of insertion needle positions. Meanwhile, the effect of brachytherapy was improved. Third, the excellent fluorescence imaging of Au/AgNDs accurately distinguished tumors from normal tissue, facilitating their use as a powerful tool for assisting surgeons during tumor resection. Taken together, our multifunctional theranostic platform offers real-time guidance for surgery and high-efficiency RT, and improves brachytherapy precision, providing a novel strategy and vision for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "Maintaining the stemness of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) is crucial for bone homeostasis and regeneration. However, in vitro expansion and bone diseases impair BMMSC stemness, limiting its functionality in bone tissue engineering. Using a deep learning-based efficacy prediction system and bone tissue sequencing, we identify a natural small-molecule compound, dihydroartemisinin (DHA), that maintains BMMSC stemness and enhances bone regeneration. During long-term in vitro expansion, DHA preserves BMMSC stemness characteristics, including its self-renewal ability and unbiased differentiation. In an osteoporosis mouse model, oral administration of DHA restores the femur trabecular structure, bone density, and BMMSC stemness in situ. Mechanistically, DHA maintains BMMSC stemness by promoting histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation via GCN5 activation both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the bone-targeted delivery of DHA by mesoporous silica nanoparticles improves its therapeutic efficacy in osteoporosis. Collectively, DHA could be a promising therapeutic agent for treating osteoporosis by maintaining BMMSC stemness.",

        "AbstractText": "The expression of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is upregulated in prostate cancer (PCa) cells and PSMA-ligands have been radiolabeled and used as radiopharmaceuticals for targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) molecular imaging, and radioguided surgery in PCa patients. Herein, we aimed at radiolabeling the PSMA-I&S cold kit with 99mTc, resulting in a radiopharmaceutical with high radiochemical yield (RCY) and stability for SPECT imaging and radioguided surgery in PCa malignancies. Various pre-clinical assays were conducted to evaluate the [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S obtained by the cold kit. These assays included assessments of RCY, radiochemical stability in saline, lipophilicity, serum protein binding (SPB), affinity for LNCaP-PCa cells (binding and internalization studies), and ex vivo biodistribution profile in naive and LNCaP-PCa-bearing mice. The radiopharmaceutical was obtained with good RCY (92.05% \u00b1 2.20%) and remained stable for 6\u00a0h. The lipophilicity was determined to be -2.41 \u00b1 0.06, while the SPB was \u223c97%. The binding percentages to LNCaP cells were 9.41% \u00b1 0.57% (1\u00a0h) and 10.45% \u00b1 0.45% (4\u00a0h), with 63.12 \u00b1 0.93 (1\u00a0h) and 65.72% \u00b1 1.28% (4\u00a0h) of the bound material being internalized. Blocking assays, employing an excess of unlabeled PSMA-I&S, resulted in a reduction in the binding percentage by 2.6 times. The ex vivo biodistribution profile confirmed high accumulation of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S in the tumor and the tumor-to-contralateral muscle ratio was \u223c6.5. In conclusion, [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S was successfully obtained by radiolabeling the cold kit using freshly eluted [99mTc]NaTcO4, exhibiting good RCY and radiochemical stability.

        "ArticleTitle": "Collective memory: between individual systems of consciousness and social systems.",
        "AbstractText": "Following a long period of neglect, research on different facets of collective memory is now developing apace in the human and social sciences, as well as at their interface with psychology and neuroscience. This resolutely multidisciplinary renewal of interest in memory sciences has given rise to a plethora of concepts with diverse meanings (e.g., social frameworks of memory, collective, shared, collaborative, social memory). The purpose of the present study was to provide a conceptual overview from a historical perspective, and above all to clarify concepts that are often used interchangeably, even though they refer to very different realities. Based on recent research in psychology and neuroscience, we use the concept of collective memory to refer to the operations of individual systems of consciousness. Collective memory is not the memory of a collective, but that of its individual members, either as members of social groups (shared memory) or as participants in social interactions (collaborative memory). Drawing on the contributions of contemporary sociology, we show that social memory is not collective memory, as it refers not to individual systems of consciousness, but to social systems. More specifically, it is the outcome of communication operations which, through redundancy and repetition, perform a continuous and selective re-imprinting of meaning that can be used for communication. Writing, printing and the new communication technologies constitute the three historical stages in the formation and development of an autonomous social memory, independent of living memories and social interactions. In the modern era, mass media fulfill an essential function of social memory, by sorting between forgetting and remembering on a planetary scale. When thinking about the articulation between collective memory and social memory, the concept of structural coupling allows us to identify two mechanisms by which individual systems of consciousness and social systems can interact and be mutually sensitized: schemas and scripts, and social roles. Transdisciplinary approach spearheads major methodological and conceptual advances and is particularly promising for clinical practice, as it should result in a better understanding of memory pathologies, including PTSD, but also cognitive disorders in cancer (chemobrain) or in neurodegenerative diseases.",

Patients who were initially recommended to have mastectomy underwent extreme oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery (eOBCS) including therapeutic reduction mammoplasty, racquet, and round-block mammoplasty, Grisotti flap, or combined technique were included. Preoperative tumor parameters, clinical outcomes, rate of local recurrence, survival, and patients' satisfaction were assessed. Eighty-six patients with a median age of 51 years were followed for a median follow-up of 75 (8-154) months; 31 (36%) had cT3 and 55 (64%) had MFMC tumors. The majority of patients (83.6%) had invasive cancer. The median UF tumor size was 58 mm (range 51-100) on imaging and 51 mm (range 50-60) on final pathology. The median tumor span for MFMC was 65 mm (range 53-95) on imaging, whereas the median of the largest tumor size was 30 mm (range 22-60) on final pathology. Seventy-one patients (82.5%) were ER-positive, 17 (19.7%) were HER2 positive, and 8 (9.3%) were triple-negative breast cancer. Four patients (4.7%) required further intervention for having positive margins (3 re-excisions, 1 completion mastectomy). Three local recurrences (3.4%) and 10 (11.6%) distant metastasis occurred. The cosmetic outcome was excellent in 37 (43%) patients. No major complications were observed. eOBCS can be a good option for patients who initially require mastectomy.

These variants are usually inherited and reports of de novo occurrences are a very rare phenomenon. We report on a breast cancer patient with a de novo BRCA1 variant c.121C>T (p.His41Tyr). The pathogenic variant was detected in leukocyte DNA of a patient with negative family history who had developed early onset, triple-negative breast cancer. The variant was not found in any of the maternal and paternal tissues tested, but it was detected in multiple samples representing all three germ layers of the affected carrier, which renders somatic mosaicism unlikely. This case highlights the importance of including early onset of disease and triple negativity of the tumor as criteria for genetic testing, even in patients without family history. Considering the availability of effective breast cancer treatments in patients with pathogenic variants in the BRCA genes, this finding underscores the importance of genetic testing in breast cancer patients.",

This investigation aims to identify potentially clinically relevant interactions between both BB-CAM and conventional medicine and two BB-CAM products in breast cancer patients (n = 47). From March 2020 to January 2021, consecutive breast cancer patients (n = 47) completed a questionnaire about their medication and BB-CAM intake at the beginning of a new intravenous or oral tumor therapy (time point 1) and again after 10 to 12 weeks (time point 2) at the LMU Breast Center in Munich. The collective was divided into two subgroups based on the time after initial diagnosis; a cutoff of 6 months was used. The survey was available through an eHealth application called CANKADO as electronic patient-reported outcome only. Lexicomp\u00ae and AiD Klinik\u00ae databases were used for evaluating potentially clinically relevant interactions. As part of routine care, the collected data were evaluated and cross-checked in interdisciplinary cooperation with the University Hospital Pharmacy LMU. 43 of the 47 included breast cancer patients (91%) used BB-CAM at some point during their treatment period. We found a significant increase from time point 1 (n = 27) to time point 2 (n = 40) (p = 0.004). Moreover, in the subgroup of newly diagnosed patients, the number significant rose from 17 at time point 1 to 28 at time point 2 (p = 0.007).

Fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (FAR) and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) correlate with tumor growth and dissemination. We aimed to bring the combination of FAR and LMR (FAR-LMR) together to establish novel nomograms for survival and recurrence in nonmetastatic breast cancer patients. We retrospectively recruited 461 female patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer from January 2011 to December 2013 in our hospital and randomly assigned them into the training cohort (N = 318) and the validation cohort (N = 143). The potential predictive factors for overall survival (OS), locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were assessed by Cox proportional hazards models and log-rank test. Elevated FAR was associated with poor OS (p < 0.001) and DMFS (p = 0.02), whereas increased LMR was associated with satisfactory OS (p = 0.01) and LRFS (p = 0.01). High FAR combined with low LMR was associated with less favorable OS (p = 0.001), LRFS (p = 0.005), and DMFS (p = 0.003) Based on multivariate analysis, FAR-LMR, tumor size, lymph node metastasis, age, and pathologic status contributed to prognostic nomograms of OS, DMFS, and LRFS. Nomograms presented exceptional performance for 3-, 5-, and 8-year OS, DMFS, and LRFS prediction compared with clinical TNM stage. The C-index was significantly higher than that of TNM stage, either of FAR or LMR (3-year: 0.709 vs. 0.621 vs. 0.544 vs. 0.641, 5-year: 0.761 vs. 0.597 vs. 0.605 vs. 0.677, 8-year: 0.84 vs. 0.62 vs. 0.539 vs. 0.623).

In a retrospective study, female patients of any age with T1-4, N0-2, M0 HR+/HER2- BC who received NAC and underwent adequate locoregional surgical treatment were included. Patients were grouped according to 2 outcomes: (a) overall response to NAC in breast and axilla by using residual cancer burden (RCB) criteria and (b) axillary downstaging after NAC by using N staging. 2 cohorts for overall response were overall SR (RCB 0-1) and no SR (RCB 2-3). On the other hand, for axillary downstaging, 2 cohorts constituted from axillary SR (ypN0 and ypN0i+) and no SR (ypNmic-N3). MagEq3 and IHC4 scores were calculated from their pathological tumor slides in each patient. HER2 status was categorized as either \"no\" or \"low.\" In addition, patient age, family history, tumor histology, stage at admission, and Ki-67 status were compared between cohorts according to predefined outcomes.

Moreover, it could also affect immune infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, we aimed to explore the effects of lipid levels on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and prognosis in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Samples from 222 patients with TNBC from July 2007 to December 2019 were obtained from the tissue specimen banks in 3 hospitals. The blood samples were used to detect the levels of lipid levels such as apolipoprotein B (Apo B), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The TILs in the 222 TNBC tissues were detected using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and the relationship between the lipid levels, clinical characteristics, and prognosis was analyzed. Among TNBC patients, the overall survival (OS) time and disease-free survival (DFS) time were lower in patients with high LDL-C levels than those with low LDL-C levels (p < 0.01, respectively). The DFS was shorter in patients with low stromal TIL (STIL) levels than those with moderate or high STIL levels (p = 0.023). Multifactor Cox regression analysis showed that LDL-C level, Apo B level, and lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer were independent risk factors for OS in TNBC patients. The number of positive lymph nodes, postoperative staging, and total amount of TILs were independent risk factors for DFS in TNBC patients.

The outcome pursued was pain outwith the surgical site measured on either NRS/VRS or VAS rating scale. CENTRAL, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched to identify studies that examined NSSP after breast cancer surgery at 6 months.

The surgical specimen revealed a 6.9 cm \u00d7 4.5 cm sized GHIP with a coexisting 1.6 cm sized well-differentiated adenocarcinoma which extended to the muscularis propria. The malignancy did not originate from the GHIP but showed an overlap. A large GHIP, which was unusually presented as an ulcerative lesion, was surgically removed, and was accompanied by advanced gastric cancer. Regular follow-up and thorough examinations of ulcerative lesions with equivocal biopsy have resulted in appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, aggressive intervention may be beneficial if GHIP is suspected.",

        "AbstractText": "Skin cancer is a common malignant tumor in dermatology. A large area must be excised to ensure a negative incisal margin on huge frontotemporal skin cancer, and it is difficult to treat the wound. In the past, treatment with skin grafting and pressure dressing was easy to cause complications such as wound infections, subcutaneous effusion, skin necrosis, and contracture. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been applied to treat huge frontotemporal skin cancer. Herein, we report the case of a 92-year-old woman with huge frontotemporal skin cancer. The patient presented to the surgery department complaining of ruptured bleeding and pain in a right frontal mass. The tumor was pathologically diagnosed as highly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The patient underwent skin cancer surgery and skin grafting, after which NPWT was used. She did not experience a relapse during the three-year follow-up period. NPWT is of great clinical value in the postoperative treatment of skin cancer. It is not only inexpensive but also can effectively reduce the risk of surgical effusion, infection, and flap necrosis.",

        "AbstractText": "Rhabdomyolysis is a life-threatening condition, often leading to progressive renal failure and death. It is caused by destruction of skeletal muscle and the release of myoglobin and other intracellular contents into the circulation. The most frequent cause of this condition is \"crush syndrome\", although several others have been described and paraneoplastic inflammatory myopathies associated with various types of cancer are repeatedly reported. We describe a rare case of a patient with pancreatic cancer who developed rhabdomyolysis early on, possibly due to paraneoplastic myositis leading to acute renal failure and eventually to rapid death. A 78-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to our hospital for obstructive jaundice and weight loss due to a lesion in the pancreatic head. She presented increasingly severe renal insufficiency with anuria, a dramatic increase in creatine phosphokinase (36000 U/L, n.v. 20-180 U/L) and myoglobin (> 120000 \u03bcg/L, n.v. 12-70 \u03bcg/L). On clinical examination, the patient showed increasing pain in the lower limbs associated with muscle weakness which was severe enough to immobilize her. Paraneoplastic myopathy linked to the malignant lesion of the pancreatic head was suspected. The patient was treated with hemodialysis and intravenous methylprednisolone. Despite all the efforts to prepare the patient for surgery, her general condition rapidly deteriorated and she eventually died 30 d after hospital admission. The possible causes of rhabdomyolysis in this patient with pancreatic cancer are discussed, the development of paraneoplastic myopathy being the most likely. Clinicians should bear in mind that these syndromes may become clinically manifest at any stage of the cancer course and their early diagnosis and treatment could improve the patient's prognosis.",

The organizing pneumonia (OP) pattern is one of the common radiological manifestations of ICI-ILD, and OP is the most common cause of reversed halo cycles and consolidations. However, opportunistic pneumonias should be excluded. In this report, we described a case of a 44-year-old man with esophageal cancer who showed multiple reversed-halo cycles and consolidations on chest computed tomography (CT) after he had a cold during immunotherapy. He was diagnosed with esophageal squamous-cell cancer (T2NIM0) after surgery. Then, he was successfully treated with 6 cycles of chemotherapy plus tislelizumab, one cycle of radiotherapy and 9 cycles of tislelizumab. Two months later, he complained of low-grade fever and cough with nonpurulent sputum after he had a cold. Community-acquired pneumonia was considered, but moxifloxacin was ineffective. Chest CT showed multiple reversed-halo cycles and consolidations. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was identified with next-generation sequence analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Two months later, he improved with standard anti-tuberculosis medications. Both the cycles and consolidations disappeared in the repeat CT after 6 mo of medications. When chest CT shows reversed-halo cycles and consolidations in patients during anticancer immunotherapy, both ICI-ILD and infectious pneumonia should be considered.

        "AbstractText": "Accumulating evidence demonstrates that autoimmune hematopoietic failure and myeloid neoplasms have an intrinsic relationship with regard to clonal hematopoiesis and disease evolution. In approximately 10%-15% of patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA), the disease phenotype is transformed into myeloid neoplasms following antithymocyte globulin plus cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive therapy. In some of these patients, myeloid neoplasms appear during or shortly after immunosuppressive therapy. Leukemic transformation in SAA patients during anti-tuberculosis treatment has not been reported. A middle-aged Chinese female had a 6-year history of non-SAA and a 2-year history of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). With aggravation of systemic inflammatory symptoms, severe pancytopenia developed, and her hemoglobinuria disappeared. Laboratory findings in cytological, immunological and cytogenetic analyses of bone marrow samples met the diagnostic criteria for \"SAA.\" Definitive diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis was made in the search for infectious niches. Remarkable improvement in hematological parameters was achieved within 1 mo of anti-tuberculosis treatment, and complete hematological remission was achieved within 4 mo of treatment. Frustratingly, the hematological response lasted for only 3 mo, and pancytopenia reemerged. At this time, cytological findings (increased bone marrow cellularity and an increased percentage of myeloblasts that accounted for 16.0% of all nucleated hematopoietic cells), immunological findings (increased percentage of cluster of differentiation 34+ cells that accounted for 12.28% of all nucleated hematopoietic cells) and molecular biological findings (identification of somatic mutations in nucleophosmin-1 and casitas B-lineage lymphoma genes) revealed that \"SAA\" had transformed into acute myeloid leukemia with mutated nucleophosmin-1. The transformation process suggested that the leukemic clones were preexistent but were suppressed in the PNH and SAA stages, as development of symptomatic myeloid neoplasm through acquisition and accumulation of novel oncogenic mutations is unlikely in an interval of only 7 mo. Aggravation of inflammatory stressors due to disseminated tuberculosis likely contributed to the repression of normal and leukemic hematopoiesis, and the relief of inflammatory stressors due to anti-tuberculosis treatment contributed to penetration of neoplastic hematopoiesis. The concealed leukemic clones in the SAA and PNH stages raise the possibility of an inflammatory stress-fueled antileukemic mechanism. Aggravated inflammatory stressors can repress normal and leukemic hematopoiesis, and relieved inflammatory stressors can facilitate penetration of neoplastic hematopoiesis.",

The musculoskeletal system is the main body system impacted and ES is rarely seen in the visceral organs particularly the adrenal gland. To present a comprehensive review of primary adrenal ES, with emphasis on diagnosis, therapy and oncological outcomes. A systematic review of the literature was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020. PubMed/ MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar bibliographic databases were searched to identify articles from 1989 to 2022 and included patients with ES/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) of the adrenal gland. PubMed, Google Scholar and EMBASE medical databases were searched, combining the terms \"adrenal\", \"ES\" and \"PNET\". Demographic, clinical, pathological and oncological data of patients were analyzed by SPSS version 29.0. A total of 52 studies were included for review (47 case reports and 5 case series) with 66 patients reported to have primary adrenal ES. Mean age at diagnosis was 26.4 \u00b1 15.4 years (37.9% males, 57.6% females, sex not reported in 3 cases). The most frequent complaint was abdominal/flank pain or discomfort (46.4%) followed by a palpable mass (25.0%), and the average duration of symptoms was 2.6 \u00b1 3.1 mo. The imaging modality of choice was computed tomography scan (81.5%), followed by magnetic resonance imaging (20.4%). Preoperative staging revealed that 17 tumors (27.9%) were metastatic and 14 patients had inferior vena cava or renal vein neoplastic thrombus at initial diagnosis. Open adrenalectomy was performed in the majority of cases (80.0%), of which 27.9% required more extensive resection. Minimally invasive surgery was attempted in 8.2% of tumors.

To establish an effective model for predicting TD formation, thus enabling clinicians to identify CRC patients at high risk for TDs and implement personalized treatment strategies. CRC patients (n = 645) who met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into training (n = 452) and validation (n = 193) cohorts using a 7:3 ratio in this retrospective analysis. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was employed to screen potential risk factors, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors. Subsequently, a predictive model for TD formation in CRC patients was constructed based on the independent risk factors. The discrimination ability of the model, its consistency with actual results, and its clinical applicability were evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic curves, area under the curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Thirty-four (7.5%) patients with TDs were identified in the training cohort based on postoperative pathological specimens. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified female sex, preoperative intestinal obstruction, left-sided CRC, and lymph node metastasis as independent risk factors for TD formation. The AUCs of the nomogram models constructed using these variables were 0.839 and 0.853 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The calibration curve demonstrated good consistency, and the training cohort DCA yielded a threshold probability of 7%-78%. This study developed and validated a nomogram with good predictive performance for identifying TDs in CRC patients. Our predictive model can assist surgeons in making optimal treatment decisions.",

        "AbstractText": "Oxaliplatin (Oxa) is the first-line chemotherapy drug for colorectal cancer (CRC), and Oxa resistance is crucial for treatment failure. Prostaglandin F2\u03b1 synthase (PGF2\u03b1) (PGFS), an enzyme that catalyzes the production of PGF2\u03b1, is involved in the proliferation and growth of a variety of tumors. However, the role of PGFS in Oxa resistance in CRC remains unclear. To explore the role and related mechanisms of PGFS in mediating Oxa resistance in CRC. The PGFS expression level was examined in 37 pairs of CRC tissues and paracancerous tissues at both the mRNA and protein levels. Overexpression or knockdown of PGFS was performed in CRC cell lines with acquired Oxa resistance (HCT116-OxR and HCT8-OxR) and their parental cell lines (HCT116 and HCT8) to assess its influence on cell proliferation, chemoresistance, apoptosis, and DNA damage. For determination of the underlying mechanisms, CRC cells were examined for platinum-DNA adducts and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the presence of a PGFS inhibitor or its products. Both the protein and mRNA levels of PGFS were increased in the 37 examined CRC tissues compared to the adjacent normal tissues. Oxa induced PGFS expression in the parental HCT116 and HCT8 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, overexpression of PGFS in parental CRC cells significantly attenuated Oxa-induced proliferative suppression, apoptosis, and DNA damage. In contrast, knockdown of PGFS in Oxa-resistant HCT116 and HCT8 cells (HCT116-OxR and HCT8-OxR) accentuated the effect of Oxa treatment in vitro and in vivo. The addition of the PGFS inhibitor indomethacin enhanced the cytotoxicity caused by Oxa. Treatment with the PGFS-catalyzed product PGF2\u03b1 reversed the effect of PGFS knockdown on Oxa sensitivity. Interestingly, PGFS inhibited the formation of platinum-DNA adducts in a PGF2\u03b1-independent manner. PGF2\u03b1 exerts its protective effect against DNA damage by reducing ROS levels. PGFS promotes resistance to Oxa in CRC via both PGF2\u03b1-dependent and PGF2\u03b1-independent mechanisms.",

Although venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major complication in IBD patients, it is often underappreciated with limited tools for risk stratification. To estimate the proportion of VTE among IBD patients and assess genetic risk factors (monogenic and polygenic) for VTE. Incident VTE was followed for 8465 IBD patients in the UK Biobank (UKB). The associations of VTE with F5 factor V leiden (FVL) mutation, F2 G20210A prothrombin gene mutation (PGM), and polygenic score (PGS003332) were tested using Cox hazards regression analysis, adjusting for age at IBD diagnosis, gender, and genetic background (top 10 principal components). The performance of genetic risk factors for discriminating VTE diagnosis was estimated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The overall proportion of incident VTE was 4.70% in IBD patients and was similar for CD (4.46%), UC (4.49%), and unclassified (6.42%), and comparable to that of cancer patients (4.66%) who are well-known at increased risk for VTE. Mutation carriers of F5/F2 had a significantly increased risk for VTE compared to non-mutation carriers, hazard ratio (HR) was 1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.42-2.65. In contrast, patients with the top PGS decile had a considerably higher risk for VTE compared to those with intermediate scores (middle 8 deciles), HR was 2.06 (95%CI: 1.57-2.71). The AUC for differentiating VTE diagnosis was 0.64 (95%CI: 0.61-0.67), 0.68 (95%CI: 0.66-0.71), and 0.69 (95%CI: 0.66-0.71), respectively, for F5/F2 mutation carriers, PGS, and combined.

        "AbstractText": "The NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) complex formed by proteins NOX1, p22phox, NOXO1, NOXA1, and RAC1 plays an important role in the generation of superoxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are involved in normal and pathological cell functions due to their effects on diverse cell signaling pathways. Cell migration and invasiveness are at the origin of tumor metastasis during cancer progression which involves a process of cellular de-differentiation known as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). During EMT cells lose their polarized epithelial phenotype and express mesenchymal marker proteins that enable cytoskeletal rearrangements promoting cell migration, expression and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), tissue remodeling, and cell invasion during metastasis. In this work, we explored the importance of the peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6)-NOX1 enzyme interaction leading to NOXA1 protein stabilization and increased levels of superoxide produced by NOX in hepatocarcinoma cells. This increase was accompanied by higher levels of N-cadherin and MMP2, correlating with a greater capacity for cell migration and invasiveness of SNU475 hepatocarcinoma cells. The increase in superoxide and the associated downstream effects on cancer progression were suppressed when phospholipase A2 or peroxidase activities of PRDX6 were abolished by site-directed mutagenesis, reinforcing the importance of these catalytic activities in supporting NOX1-based superoxide generation. Overall, these results demonstrate a clear functional cooperation between NOX1 and PRDX6 catalytic activities which generate higher levels of ROS production, resulting in a more aggressive tumor phenotype.",

        "AbstractText": "Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is a multifunctional enzyme that exhibits transamidase, GTPase, kinase, and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) activities. Of these, transamidase-mediated modification of proteins regulates apoptosis, differentiation, inflammation, and fibrosis. TG2 is highly expressed in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) compared with differentiated cells, suggesting a role of TG2 specific for MSC characteristics. In this study, we report a new function of TG2 in the regulation of MSC redox homeostasis. During in vitro MSC expansion, TG2 is required for cell proliferation and self-renewal by preventing premature senescence but has no effect on the expression of surface antigens and oxidative stress-induced cell death. Moreover, induction of differentiation upregulates TG2 that promotes osteoblastic differentiation. Molecular analyses revealed that TG2 mediates tert-butylhydroquinone, but not sulforaphane, -induced nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) activation in a transamidase activity-independent manner. Differences in the mechanism of action between two NRF2 activators suggest that PDI activity of TG2 may be implicated in the stabilization of NRF2. The role of TG2 in the regulation of antioxidant response was further supported by transcriptomic analysis of MSC. These results indicate that TG2 is a critical enzyme in eliciting antioxidant response in MSC through NRF2 activation, providing a target for optimizing MSC manufacturing processes to prevent premature senescence.",

In early stage diabetic nephropathy, the hyperglycemic environment leads to vascular endothelial cell damage, resulting in overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in podocytes and renal pathology of glomerular hypertrophy, glomerular basement membrane thickening, and mesangial hyperplasia. In diabetic nephropathy, renal thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) develops and the nephropathy progressively worsens in some cases of severe glomerular podocyte damage. Further, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) may suppress VEGF secretion via VEGF receptor-2 tyrosine kinase inhibition in podocytes, which results in renal TMA and rapid deterioration of diabetic nephropathy. Osimertinib, a third-generation irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-TKI, is approved as a first-line treatment agent for metastatic or locally advanced EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer. We encountered a case of a patient with diabetic nephropathy with lung adenocarcinoma treated with osimertinib, whose condition deteriorated from early nephropathy to end-stage renal disease in approximately 4 months.

The second course of BEP was completed without worsening severe COVID-19 or bleomycin-induced lung injury. The patient completed four courses of BEP, with normalization of tumor markers, partial response on imaging, and improvement in lower body paralysis. In this case, we successfully treated a patient with testicular germ cell tumor with chemotherapy while having COVID-19 without treatment delay. During the COVID-19 pandemic, concomitant chemotherapy and COVID-19 treatment are warranted because delaying treatment will decrease the efficacy of highly curative diseases such as germ cell tumors.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Giant Mature Ovarian Cystic Teratoma in a Pediatric Patient: Case Report and Literature Review.",
        "AbstractText": "Mature cystic teratomas, also called dermoid cysts, are the most common germ-cell ovarian neoplasms in children. On average, ovarian dermoid cysts are slow-growing neoplasms with a mean size between 6.4 and 7.0 cm that enlarge at a rate of 1.8 mm/year; however, these can reach large dimensions. Giant ovarian tumors are defined as those having a maximum diameter equal to or more than 15 cm; these represent a therapeutic challenge as they increase the risk of wide wound size and surgical invasiveness. In this paper, we present a case of a 10-year-old Hispanic female that complained of abdominal pain, distension, and nausea. Physical examination revealed a mass on the left side of the abdomen and an axial computed tomography found a large pelvic tumor extending to the abdominal region. After a laparotomy approach, pathology evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of mature cystic teratoma. The patient recovered thoroughly and had no complications at a 6-month follow-up. We conducted a literature review including English and Spanish reports about giant ovarian teratomas; we retrieved 16 cases from 2003 to 2023. We concluded that giant ovarian tumors may be underreported, particularly in resource-limited areas where tumors might grow unrecognized, and that English-language bias might play a substantial role in literature reviews involving case reports and case series.",

The tissue of origin could not be determined in both of these patients utilizing morphology and immunohistochemical analysis of the tissue samples. Next-generation sequencing and tumor-of-origin testing using an RNA-based molecular cancer classifier were performed to elucidate the possible tissue of origin. A 61-year-old male with a history of localized basal cell carcinoma presented with a 4.4-cm axillary lymph node in addition to upper extremity edema and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. RNA-based tumor origin testing revealed skin basal or squamous cell carcinoma as the likely tissue of origin, with a probability of 97%. He received vismodegib, a hedgehog inhibitor, after progression on cemiplimab and experienced a partial response by RECIST criteria, which is currently ongoing for over a year. A 74-year-old female patient with a remote history of ovarian cancer for which she underwent resection and adjuvant chemotherapy presented 15 years later with abdominal pain. The diagnostic workup revealed a 2-cm pancreatic mass and enlarged peritoneal lymph nodes. RNA sequencing revealed a 99% likelihood of the tissue of origin being serous ovarian carcinoma. Subsequently, she underwent surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy and is currently in remission with letrozole maintenance. Genomic data already plays a crucial role in therapeutic decision-making for individuals with cancer. These cases highlight the complementary role of genomic data in the diagnostic workup of cancer, leading to favorable patient outcomes.",

Recent data implies that deficiency mismatch repair proteins inducing microsatellite instability are considered one of the potential drivers of this disease. Hence, we report a stomach MiNEN with MMR protein loss. An admitted 60-year-old woman complained of epigastric pain. The pathological analysis of the gastro-endoscopic biopsy specimen revealed gastric adenocarcinoma. The radiological staging was cT3N1M0; therefore, she received D2 distal gastrectomy. Suspecting neuroendocrine component admix with adenocarcinoma part on the resected specimen microscopy, applying biomarkers including AE 1/3, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A to confirm the diagnosis of MiNEN. The neuroendocrine part was classified as neuroendocrine tumor grade 2 with Ki 67 at 16.5%. To further understand the molecular characterization of this disease, we evaluated mismatch protein expression by staining MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 antibodies. Interestingly, both components lost MLH1 and PMS2 proteins. Her radical surgery followed oxaliplatin/capecitabine adjuvant chemotherapy.

It is known to cause drug-induced cardiotoxicity, including QT prolongation syndrome, heart failure, and ventricular arrhythmias, which can lead to sudden death. Once severe arrhythmias occur, it is difficult to continue osimertinib treatment. We report a case of a 66-year-old woman with recurrent NSCLC after concurrent chemoradiotherapy who experienced osimertinib-induced ventricular arrhythmia-causing syncope. The patient was initially treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and genetic testing revealed EGFR exon 19 deletion. Three years following treatment initiation, the primary tumor progressed, and new bone metastases developed. The patient was diagnosed with recurrent NSCLC and was treated with targeted therapy with osimertinib. On the 10th day of osimertinib administration, syncope occurred. Electrocardiography showed polymorphic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, which was believed to be the cause of syncope. The patient was switched to erlotinib. Two and a half years later, disease progression in the primary lesion was observed. A liquid biopsy revealed an EGFR T790M resistance mutation. Therefore, osimertinib (40 mg) was administered every alternate day. After confirming the absence of palpitations and arrhythmias on electrocardiogram, the osimertinib dosing was increased to 40 mg daily. Thereafter, no further events occurred, and tumor shrinkage was observed. Low-dose osimertinib rechallenge after induced ventricular arrhythmia may be considered an option under close monitoring; however, osimertinib rechallenge must be carefully selected based on the risk-benefit analysis.",

The patient was referred to our hospital because of biochemical and radiographic progression after four cycles of docetaxel as a first-line therapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Transurethral resection of the prostate and hepatic biopsy revealed small-cell carcinoma with positive expression of neuroendocrine markers.

Our investigation emphasizes the crucial role of EVI1 disruption in accelerating the progression of secondary tumors. This case underscores the significant risk of SMNs following pediatric cancer therapy. By analyzing genetic anomalies, we identified variations in the PTPN11 and KMT2C genes, suggesting a complex interplay between genetic susceptibility and chemotherapy-induced mutagenesis in tAML development. Furthermore, our exploration of the involvement of topoisomerase II inhibitors in tAML provides insights into potential future therapeutic approaches. Reporting this case is vital for deepening our understanding of the mechanisms driving SMNs after pediatric cancer treatments. Through a comprehensive analysis of genetic anomalies and treatment variables, we can offer more precise clinical diagnoses and treatment strategies.

Despite these developments for some genetic aberrations, the prognostic value and the impact of soft tissue metastases in infants are not fully understood, nor well described in the different classification systems, hampering the definitions to uniformly treat patients and predict prognosis. A literature review on staging of infants with M/MS disease was performed at the occasion of the diagnosis of NB in an 8-month-old boy who presented with atypical metastatic sites in soft tissue and an aberrant tumor biology. The definitions of stage 4/4S/4s/M/MS/Ms were evaluated and compared to enable tumor risk stratification and inform management. International NB groups use different criteria for defining stage of infants with metastasized NB, resulting in differences in management. Limited literature is available on soft tissue metastases, especially muscular metastases, and is poorly incorporated into management guidelines mainly due to the lack of data. The uncertain prognosis of rare genetic aberrancies may add to the difficulties in treatment decisions. In some rare cases of NB in infants, the international treatment classification is not sufficient for staging and treatment decisions. Based on tumor progression, biology of unknown significance and a lack of evidence to classify a child under 12 months with NB and multiple muscular metastases, the patient was treated as stage 4/M and intermediate-risk protocols with a favorable outcome.",

        "AbstractText": "Capillary leak syndrome is a rare life-threatening disorder of acute endothelial hyperpermeability. It consists of initial fluid extravasation resulting in hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and hemoconcentration, followed by noncardiogenic pulmonary edema from rapid fluid remobilization into intravascular compartment. Drug-induced etiology is an important diagnostic consideration in cancer patients, particularly with use of antimetabolites, immunostimulants, and monoclonal antibodies. Sorafenib-mediated capillary leak syndrome has never been reported. Here, we present the case of a 29-year-old female patient with a desmoid tumor of the thigh, who was admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure after recent initiation of sorafenib. She was found to have extensive pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions, and hemoconcentration, all of which stabilized on supportive care with noninvasive mechanical ventilation and intravenous diuresis. Her infectious and cardiac work-up were negative. Given the temporal relationship between sorafenib use and symptom onset as well as a lack of an alternative etiology of her findings, patient was deemed to have sorafenib-induced acute capillary leak syndrome. Importantly, she did not become hypotensive prior to or during this hospitalization. To our knowledge, we reported for the first time an atypical presentation of acute capillary leak syndrome due to sorafenib use without hemodynamic instability.",

        "AbstractText": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors are increasingly being used to treat various malignancies. Despite their efficacy, they are known to potentially cause immune-related adverse effects, including dermatological manifestations. A rare cutaneous immune-related adverse effect is scleroderma, which has been reported to occur with anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) agents such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab. This may present with skin tightening and hardening at any point during or after immunotherapy. We present the case of a 54-year-old Caucasian woman who, following 16 doses of pembrolizumab for breast cancer, developed clinical features of scleroderma confirmed on histology. She was initially treated with oral corticosteroids, followed by oral psoralen-UVA, with poor response, but eventually improved with methotrexate. A literature review revealed 12 other cases of scleroderma following pembrolizumab treatment and 6 cases of scleroderma following nivolumab treatment. Males and females were both affected, and their ages ranged from 33 to 81 years. Scleroderma developed at different stages of pembrolizumab or nivolumab therapy. Although scleroderma is not commonly drug-induced, anti-PD-1 agents may be a rare cause and it is important to elicit an accurate drug history, including immunotherapy, in such cases.",

Recognition of the associated sequelae of this condition may improve short- and long-term outcomes. A 56-year-old black female with a history of uterine leiomyosarcoma diagnosed incidentally after total abdominal hysterectomy for fibroid uterus without initiation of chemoradiation treatment presented to the emergency department complaining of generalized weakness and progressively worsening stridor for 2 weeks. The patient was experiencing shortness of breath, dysphagia, and hoarseness. Physical exam was remarkable for rhonchi but was otherwise normal. Diagnostic imaging via CT of the abdomen, pelvis, and chest revealed DVTs of the left common and external iliac veins, the superior mesenteric artery, multiple pulmonary emboli of the right pulmonary artery, several nodular lesions within the lungs, and scattered peritoneal necrotic lesions, which were suspicious for metastatic disease. Additionally, CT of the neck showed an exophytic mass protruding into the airway from the subglottic region and thyromegaly with bilateral thyroid lobe nodules. The patient was subsequently started on Eliquis and chemotherapy. The rarity of this case is rooted in the extent of the patient's DVTs and PEs secondary to hypercoagulability in metastatic cancer. This presentation should be further evaluated to exclude thrombophilias or underlying malignancies.

The patient was subsequently initiated on a paclitaxel and bevacizumab regimen. During this treatment, the patient complained of palpitations and malaise. Chest radiography revealed a left pneumothorax. Despite attempts at conservative treatment, the pneumothorax did not improve and a thoracoscopic approach was required. One of the metastatic tumors in the left lower lobe appeared to rupture, and this area was estimated to be the cause of air leak. The tumor was covered with a tissue seal sheet, and the patient's condition improved with no recurrence of pneumothorax. This case highlights the importance of early conversion to surgical treatment when conservative treatment for pneumothorax is unresponsive due to the potential side effects of bevacizumab.

        "AbstractText": "The incidence of gastric cancer associated with esophageal cancer is notably high. In recent years, there has been an increase in patients with gastric conduit cancers due to early detection and radical treatment of esophageal cancer, leading to prolonged survival of the patients. Metachronous gastric cancer following esophagectomy sometimes can pose a clinical challenge for surgeons, while gastric tube reconstruction is a well-established procedure accompanying esophagectomy, treating gastric cancer within the gastric tube can be difficult in contrast. Surgical treatment of gastric tube cancers is often complex and life-threatening. Early detection of gastric tube cancer is crucial for improving prognosis as it allows for less invasive surgical interventions. However, no specific guidelines for detecting gastric tube cancer have been established. In this report, we present a case of gastric tube cancer in a patient that had Ivor-Lewis surgery 20 years ago for preinvasive adenocarcinoma of the thoracic esophagus against the background of Barrett's esophagus.

Liposarcoma is a high-grade malignancy with a poor prognosis and high rates of recurrence. A case is described of multiply recurrent liposarcoma that we treated with re-irradiation of an extended field encompassing the gross recurrent tumor mass and including the previously irradiated region. The patient had a very good cosmetic outcome and remained disease-free after 3 years of follow-up. The case demonstrates the potential to significantly improve patient care if established dogmas are challenged related to the re-irradiation of recurrent high-grade tumors.

Elderly cancer patients are at a high risk for TB, and the treatment of TB reactivation in these patients is challenging. Among cancer patients, the incidence of TB reactivation is the highest in lymphoma patients. However, the impact of chemotherapy on TB reactivation in lymphoma patients is unknown. We report the case of an immunocompetent elderly patient with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) having no prior history of TB, who developed miliary TB during multiagent chemotherapy consisting of rituximab, high-dose methotrexate, procarbazine, and vincristine (R-MPV therapy). Retrospectively, the chest computed tomography showed calcification of the pleura, suggesting that the patient had a latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and developed miliary TB from the reactivation of TB triggered by the R-MPV therapy. Our case emphasizes that when chemotherapy is administered to patients with PCNSL, interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) should be performed if there are findings on chest examination suggestive of LTBI, such as pleural calcification, and if IGRA is positive, chemotherapy should be given concurrently with LTBI treatment.",

Apalutamide-induced skin rash occurred commonly in clinical trials, with 23.8-27.1% of patients experiencing a rash of any grade, and 5.2-6.3% experiencing a rash of grade three or higher. There were no cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) reported in clinical trials; however, there are rare cases reported in the literature with the majority occurring in Asian patients. An 83-year-old Caucasian male was commenced on apalutamide, combined with degarelix, for the management of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. During week five of apalutamide treatment, the patient developed a widespread erythematous maculopapular rash. On presentation, the rash affected 80% of his body surface area (BSA) and a diagnosis of a severe cutaneous drug eruption was made. He was commenced on methylprednisolone (MP) therapy. Despite 5 days of MP, the rash continued to deteriorate involving 95% of his BSA. Nikolsky's sign was positive. A diagnosis of overlap SJS/TEN was made, supported by skin biopsy.

It is benign histologically, although it could infiltrate locally and recur following excision; however, it is free from the potential to metastasize. It is spontaneous or associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP]) mutation as a part of Gardner's syndrome. This case report discusses the radiological, intraoperative, and histopathological findings from a 45-year-old male patient who presented with abdominal pain and a palpable mass in the left hemiabdomen. The pain was dull and aching, extending to the back and unrelated to any other gastrointestinal symptoms. There was no history of severe weight reduction. Furthermore, he is not a smoker. There were no comorbidities, severe medical diseases, or prior surgical procedures. Computerized tomography revealed a well-defined, lobulated, heterogeneously enhancing altered signal intensity mass at the mesocolon. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed an intra-abdominal mass. Macroscopic mass characteristics include a well-defined mass measuring 22 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 11 cm connected to a small intestine segment measuring 21 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 cm. Histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations of the resected tumor, including positive nuclear immunostaining for beta-catenin, confirmed a postoperative diagnosis of desmoid-type fibromatosis. Based on its clinical presentation and computed tomography results, this case demonstrated how desmoid-type fibromatosis of the colon might mimic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Due to the varied therapies and follow-up methods used for these lesions, the differential diagnosis between desmoid-type fibromatosis and GIST is clinically significant.",

McKittrick-Wheelock syndrome (MKWS) is a rare manifestation of tubulovillous adenoma. It generally presents as hypersecretory diarrhea with severe electrolyte and fluid depletion. Roughly, 5% of the published cases have reported malignant histopathology associated with MKWS, with little to no data regarding the malignant transformation process of those patients. Our patient was a 53-year-old Asian woman suffering from chronic secretory diarrhea, resulting in severe volume, electrolyte depletion, and prerenal azotemia, consistent for MKWS. Her symptoms initially improved with sulfasalazine but eventually worsened. She demonstrated signs of systemic (elevated leukocyte, CRP, and LDH) and local inflammation (dense lymphocyte infiltration in colorectal tissue) throughout the course of her disease. Serial pathological results showed rapid neoplastic progression of adenomatous polyp to adenocarcinoma within 1 year period. Surgical resection resulted in complete symptom resolution. Molecular examination showed a favorable profile of exon 4 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog mutation, normal NRAS, BRAF, CDX2, and CK20 expressions. Her molecular pattern did not reflect the profile of an aggressive disease, suggesting the possibility of oncogenic processes outside the major pathways of adenoma to carcinoma progression. Chronic inflammation is a well-established risk factor for colorectal cancer, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been observed as one of the key regulators of tumor initiation and growth. PGE2 is also responsible for hypersecretory diarrhea associated with MKWS.",

The current patient was a 65-year-old woman who had breast cancer with local invasion, lung metastasis, and bone metastasis from the time of the initial disease onset. Despite the administration of various chemotherapy and hormone therapy regimens, the tumor increased gradually, and at 2 years and 5 months after the initial onset, pain and bleeding from metastatic infiltration of the cervical lymph nodes were noted. Therefore, radiotherapy was indicated for palliation of pain and bleeding caused by metastatic invasion of the cervical lymph nodes. Irradiation (30 Gy/10fr) was planned with a 3-field technique using 4MVX and 10MVX. Approximately 11 h after the initial irradiation, symptoms such as respiratory distress, tachycardia, and hypotension were observed. Blood tests revealed hyperuricemia and hyperkalemia, leading to a diagnosis of TLS. Dialysis and electrolyte correction were immediately initiated resulting in normalization of electrolytes and stabilization of the blood pressure.

We describe a case in which TORS was used in a 71-year-old man with a skeletal disorder, spastic stridor, and a T2N1M0 stage I p16-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma. Prior to the procedure, he underwent right cervical dissection (levels II-IV). Although he had an oblique neck, the right side of his neck was naturally hyperextended because the dissection was performed on the right side. The right facial, lingual, and external carotid arteries were ligated in preparation for TORS. Postoperative pathological examination revealed no extranodal involvement of the metastatic lymph nodes. A two-stage TOVS procedure was performed for the oropharyngeal tumor, in which the surgeon was required to be positioned at the patient's head to allow direct manipulation. This makes the neck and oral cavity more susceptible to the skeletal effects. In contrast, in TORS, the da Vinci insertion angle can be set to match the angle of the neck, allowing surgeons to operate with less skeletal influence. TORS is more useful in this setting.",

        "AbstractText": "Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) can seriously affect the quality of life of cancer patients. Trichoscopic patterns and confocal microscopy (RCM) features of CIA have been scarcely studied. This study aimed to investigate the dermoscopic and RCM features of CIA in 19 females and 5 males, with CIA due to current or recent chemotherapy. Patients with CIA and current or recent (within 2 months) history of chemotherapy treatment were enrolled. After clinical examination, standard pictures were taken by digital camera (SLR Canon PowerShot G10) and trichoscopic images were captured by the Handyscope device (20x). Images of RCM were acquired by VivaScope 3000 with the VivaStack option. The trichoscopic and confocal images were acquired by three independent observers after central parting on three areas: vertex, middle, and frontal scalp. A total of 24 patients were enrolled. CIA has features of anagen effluvium at trichoscopy but with low frequency of yellow dots and prominence of black dots. The simultaneous presence of pseudo-monilethrix and black dots at trichoscopy confirms the hypothesis that chemotherapy insults the hair follicle intermittently. At RCM, the presence of abnormal hair shaft morphology highlights that the insults affect hair shaft production. These are the first data in this field, so further studies with a higher number of patients analyzed are needed to confirm these findings.",

        "AbstractText": "Cholesterol-rich low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles have been demonstrated to regulate breast cancer cell proliferation and migration, but their biological function and relevant mechanisms in endometrial carcinoma (EC) remain unclear. Serum and tissue samples were collected from EC patients (n\u2009=\u200950) and patients with benign endometrial hyperplasia (n\u2009=\u200950). Ishikawa and RL95-2 cells were stimulated with different concentrations of LDL, followed by treatment with a JAK2 inhibitor (SD-1029). LDL concentrations were determined by ELISA. The in vitro biological behavior of cells was examined using the CCK-8 assay, EdU staining, and Transwell assay. The tumorigenicity of LDL in vivo was examined using a xenograft mouse model. western blotting, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry studies were performed to measure related protein expression. The LDL concentrations and levels of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 expression were elevated in the clinical samples. Similar trends in expression were detected in EC cells after LDL stimulation. LDL treatment significantly promoted EC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and also upregulated p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, SD-1029 dramatically blocked the LDL-mediated effects on EC cells. Intravenous injection of LDLs promoted tumor growth in the xenograft nude mice, and also increased p-JAK2, p-STAT3, and Ki-67 expression, and downregulated caspase-3 expression. These findings indicate that LDLs exert an oncogenic effect in EC cells by activating the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, and also suggest the JAK/STAT pathway as a possible therapeutic target for EC.",

Two lymph nodes around the inferior mesenteric artery pedicle were completely excised. Pathological examination revealed a moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. Nodules were only found in the main lymph node area, and no lymph node structures were observed in these nodules. These tumor deposits (TDs) may be extramural TDs without lymph node structure or lymph node skip metastasis. The presence of TDs in colorectal cancer is associated with an adverse prognosis, and the requirement of chemotherapy in such cases should be examined. Therefore, it is important to correctly recognize TDs and categorize the disease into a high- or low-risk group within stage III. We report this case because it is necessary to review the definition of TDs, and the assessment of extramural TDs remains controversial.",

        "AbstractText": "Laparoscopic surgery is widely used for rectal cancer; however, this technique is challenging due to tapering of the mesorectum in the pelvis, and the forward angle of the distal rectum, which renders this part of the rectum less accessible from the abdominal cavity. Hence, concerns regarding its safety and curability have been raised, particularly for inadequate distal and circumferential resection margins. Recently, transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME), which involves endoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) retrogradely from the anal side, has attracted attention worldwide as a solution to these problems. TaTME is superior to the conventional laparoscopic approach for rectal cancer in terms of both oncological and functional preservations. However, a shallow learning curve caused by the unfamiliar anatomical view from the anal side can pose challenges. Therefore, an efficient educational system needs to be established. Randomized controlled trials comparing conventional laparoscopic TME with TaTME are ongoing to demonstrate the usefulness of TaTME. This article reviews changes in the surgical treatment of rectal cancer, with a focus on TaTME, and describes the indications, surgical techniques, and training curricula for TaTME.",

Although approximately 70% of early-onset CRC cases are sporadic, with no apparent family history, approximately 25% have a familial component, and up to 20% may be associated with germline mutations, indicating a higher prevalence compared with the general population. Despite the progress in identifying the environmental, molecular, and genetic risk factors of early-onset CRC, the underlying causes for the global increase in its incidence remain unclear. This comprehensive review aims to provide a thorough analysis of early-onset CRC by examining the trends associated with its incidence, clinical and pathological characteristics, risk factors, molecular and genetic profiles, prognosis and screening strategies. By deepening our understanding of early-onset CRC, significant advances related to improving the outcomes and alleviating the burden of this disease on individuals, families, and healthcare systems can be achieved.",

        "AbstractText": "Cowden syndrome (CS)/PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited condition caused by germline pathogenesis. It is associated with multiple hamartomatous lesions occurring in various organs and tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, skin, mucous membranes, breast, thyroid, endometrium, and brain. Macrocephaly or multiple characteristic mucocutaneous lesions commonly develop in individuals in their 20s. This syndrome is occasionally diagnosed in childhood due to the occurrence of multiple gastrointestinal polyps, autism spectrum disorders, and intellectual disability. CS/PHTS can be diagnosed taking the opportunity of multigene panel testing in patients with cancer. Appropriate surveillance for early diagnosis of associated cancers is required because patients have a high risk of cancers including breast, thyroid, colorectal, endometrial, and renal cancers. Under these circumstances, there is growing concern regarding the management of CS/PHTS in Japan, but there are no available practice guidelines. To address this situation, the guideline committee, which included specialists from multiple academic societies, was organized by the Research Group on Rare and Intractable Diseases granted by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, Japan. The present clinical guidelines explain the principles in the diagnosis and management of CS/PHTS, together with four clinical questions and the corresponding recommendations, incorporating the concept of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Herein, we present an English version of the guideline, some of which have been updated, to promote seamless implementation of accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients with CS/PHTS.",

We focused on the anastomotic techniques following ISR with TaTME and examined the feasibility and safety of the SST below the anorectal junction (ARJ). Data on postoperative anastomosis-related complications and anorectal function was evaluated in comparison to conventional manual hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis in ISR with TaTME. We examined patients with 3-6 cm tumors from the anal verge who underwent ISR with TaTME between January 2018 and March 2020, and whose anastomotic line was located below the ARJ. Postoperative short-term outcomes and anorectal functions were compared. We also analyzed the effects of various factors on major low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) using multivariate logistic regression analysis. In total, 87 patients-48 in the hand-sewn anastomosis group and 39 in the SST group-were included in this study. SST below the ARJ in ISR with TaTME did not exacerbate surgical outcomes, including anastomosis-related complications. The SST group had a significantly lower LARS score as compared to the hand-sewn anastomosis group, and the proportion of major LARS was significantly lower. Only hand-sewn anastomosis was identified as a statistically significant independent risk factor for major LARS. In TaTME, SST below the ARJ was safe and feasible and had a lower negative impact on postoperative anastomosis-related complications and anorectal function as compared to hand-sewn anastomosis. Thus, SST is a promising anastomotic option for patients with low-lying rectal tumors.",

This study enrolled 263 patients who underwent curative resection for stage II/III colorectal cancer. C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio was calculated within 30 days before and 7 days after surgery. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed to determine the optimal cutoff values of preoperative and postoperative C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio. The correlations between combined preoperative and postoperative C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio and prognosis were analyzed. The cutoff values of preoperative and postoperative C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio were 0.223 and 0.813, respectively; higher ratios were significantly associated with poor overall survival, based on the Kaplan-Meier curves (p < 0.001, p = 0.003, respectively). Further, preoperative and postoperative C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratios were correlated with poor progression-free survival (p < 0.001, p = 0.064, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, combined preoperative and postoperative C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio was an independent predictor of overall survival and progression-free survival (p = 0.012, p = 0.044, respectively). Compared with low preoperative and postoperative C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio, high ratios of that were significantly associated with poor overall survival (hazard ratio = 3.897, p = 0.006) and progression-free survival (hazard ratio = 2.130, p = 0.029). Combined preoperative and postoperative C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio, useful for prognostic prediction, can be a promising prognostic marker after curative resection in patients with colorectal cancer.",

The findings of this scoping review offer exciting insights into epigenetic and neuroepigenetic application in SCI research. Several key genes, proteins, and pathways emerged across studies, suggesting the critical role of epigenetic regulation in biological processes. This review reinforced the dearth of studies that leverage epigenetic methods to identify prognostic biomarkers in SHCs.

The mean age of the 90 patients was 65.3\u00a0years, and the mean serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 16.9\u00a0ng/ml. The sensitivity and specificity of mp-MRI in the detection of the corresponding region of interest (ROI) on HPE were 67.4% and 89.3% respectively. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of mp-MRI in the detection of corresponding ROI on HPE were 86.3%, 73.3%, and 78.3% respectively. The mp-MRI detected 96.8% solitary lesions and 61.7% multifocal lesions on the corresponding ROI on HPE. Multiparametric MRI has an excellent specificity and reasonable sensitivity for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. It is a good modality for the detection of solitary tumours, higher-grade tumours, detection of seminal vesicle invasion and extracapsular extension and helps in the decision-making process before radical prostatectomy, focal therapy or selecting an appropriate candidate for active surveillance.",

        "AbstractText": "Complete resection of large retroperitoneal tumors often requires vascular resection and reconstruction, which is frequently performed using prosthetic grafts. We report our experience with inferior vena cava reconstruction utilizing a large peritoneal interposition tube graft performed during en bloc resection of retroperitoneal sarcoma and multiorgan resection. This study aimed to increase the awareness of surgical oncologists about the venous reconstruction technique using a large autologous peritoneal graft. An elderly male presented to our cancer center with a history of persistent abdominal pain. The computed tomography (CT) scan reported a large retroperitoneal mass involving the right kidney and the inferior vena cava (IVC). En bloc tumor resection with right nephrectomy and resection of the IVC extending from just above the bifurcation up to the origin of the renal veins was done. IVC reconstruction was performed using autologous parietal peritoneum tube graft. Harvesting the peritoneum and fashioning a large peritoneal tube graft was challenging. Post-operatively, the patient recovered without any complications and was discharged on oral anticoagulants. The CT scan during the follow-up visit at 6\u00a0months revealed that the IVC graft was patent with a good flow. Autologous peritoneal grafts are a safe, valid, and readily available option for venous reconstruction.",

        "AbstractText": "In India, oral cancers are the major cause of cancer-related death. Tongue and buccal mucosa being the major subsites in oral cancer have varying clinicopathological presentations. This study is intended to know the difference in clinicopathological behavior of these two subsites. This retrospective study included 474 patients of which 232 patients had tongue cancer and 242 patients had buccal alveolar complex (BAC) cancer. Comparison between the pathological characters including pattern of nodal involvement was analyzed. Disease-free survival (DFS) and factors influencing the DFS were analyzed and compared using Cox regression analysis. Mean age of the study population was 52.7 years. Tongue oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) differed significantly from BAC OSCC in terms of age of presentation, tumor staging, and perineural invasion. Among neck nodal involvement, tongue OSCC commonly involved level IIa (p < 0.001) whereas BAC involved level Ib (p < 0.001). At a median follow-up of 27 months, 141 patients had disease recurrence, tongue OSCC commonly recurred in neck (p = 0.008), and BAC OSCC relapsed at primary site (p = 0.001). Patients older than 45 years with BAC cancer had lesser risk of recurrence (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.2-0.5; p < 0.0001). Pathological tumor stage in tongue cancer (HR, 14.9; 95% CI, 2.6-84.8; p = 0.002) and grade of tumor differentiation in BAC OSCC (HR, 9.2; 95% CI, 1.9-43.3; p < 0.005) were the most significant factors that influenced tumor recurrence. There was a significant difference in factors influencing disease recurrence among tongue and BAC OSCC. Also, pattern of nodal metastasis and pattern of recurrence were different. Hence, further research on OSCC may be done site specific. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13193-023-01750-8.",

It accounts for approximately 5-10% of all thyroid cancers (Leboulleux et al. in Clin Endocrinol 61(3):299-310, 2004). The main treatment for medullary thyroid carcinoma is surgery, which involves the removal of the thyroid gland and any affected lymph nodes. In advanced cases where the cancer has spread to nearby structures such as the trachea (Gupta et al. in Indian J Surg Oncol 11(1):75-79, 2020), tracheal resection followed by reconstruction may be necessary to remove the cancer (Chernichenko et al. in Curr Opin Oncol 24(1):29-34,\u00a02012) and restore proper breathing, closure of large tracheal defect can be done with pectoralis major myocutaneous flap (Salmer\u00f3n-Gonz\u00e1lez et al.

The scarless latissimus dorsi flap is a useful technique which can harvest a major portion of the latissimus dorsi muscle using the same mastectomy incision without requiring repositioning of the patient, to cover the lower pole of prosthesis for reconstruction. The aim of this study was to assess and evaluate the cosmetic results and complications of scarless LD flap used as a lower pole cover in post-mastectomy breast reconstruction with implants. This is a pilot study of 18 breast cancer patients who underwent implant-based scarless LD flap breast reconstructions during a period of 4\u00a0years from 2017 to 2021. A questionnaire based on relevant subscales of BREAST-Q scores was completed by all the patients and used for evaluation. A total of 18 patients who underwent 20 surgeries were evaluated for the study. The median age was 44.5\u00a0years. The mean operative time was observed to be 164.50\u00a0min. The mean length of hospital stay was 3.1\u00a0days. From the Breast Q subscales, the mean cosmetic score was 31 out of 36 (range 27-36) (higher score reflecting better cosmetic outcome), and the mean physical well-being score was 17.25 out of 54 (range 12-29) (lower score reflecting better outcome). Overall complications were observed to be 20% which included minimal flap necrosis in 2 patients which was managed conservatively, and seromas in 2 patients which needed ultrasound-guided aspirations twice. There were no major complications. The scarless LD flap provides an adequate lower pole muscle coverage for implants in breast reconstruction. It has less morbidity and good cosmetic outcomes.

Demographic profile, surgical-pathological information, details of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy, and peri-operative complications were analyzed. Long-term follow-up data was gathered, with an evaluation of various prognostic factors impacting recurrence and overall survival outcome. Forty-five cases with mean age of 56.2\u00a0years (range 29-82) were treated during the study period. Surgery was the initial treatment modality in 41 (91.1%) cases. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery was given to four cases. After complete surgico-pathological staging, most patients had stage I disease (26 cases, 57.8%) and 22.2% had stage II disease. Owing to microscopic lymph node involvement, seven cases (15.6%) belonged to FIGO stage III disease. Two cases had stage IVA disease with fixed groin nodes. Adjuvant chemotherapy in the form of 5-fluoro uracil and cisplatin was administered to four out of the nine patients with nodal involvement. The remaining five were advised adjuvant groin radiation. At a median follow-up of 34\u00a0months (range 2-114\u00a0months), 12 cases (26.7%) experienced a recurrence and one case with stage IVA disease progressed during adjuvant chemotherapy.

There were a total number of 10 deaths, of which seven were due to disease recurrence or progression and the remaining 30% of deaths were due to medical co-morbid conditions. Overall survival was negatively impacted by increasing age (age\u2009>\u200960\u00a0years), number of positive nodes, presence of perinodal spread, and stage of the disease. Recurrence-free survival was significantly reduced in those with the presence of peri-nodal spread and lympho-vascular space invasion.

The present work aims to study the morphologic and immunohistochemical (IHC) profile of primary ovarian cancers with an assessment of post-chemotherapy changes. A total of 51 cases were included in the study from June 2017 to June 2019 (prospective and retrospective). The demographic and clinical details of the patients were collected. The gross and microscopic features of the tumors were studied, and the post-chemotherapy changes were evaluated. A chi-square test was used to determine the association of tumor morphology, the chemotherapy response score (CRS), and stage of the tumor with survival (PFS and OS). The mean patient age was 47.5\u00a0years, and high-grade serous carcinoma (66.6%) (HGSC) was the most common subtype followed by mucinous carcinoma and endometrioid carcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis with WT1 and p53 helped in the diagnosis of HGSC. The CRS was 1 and 2 in most of the cases. The follow-up for patients of HGSC was available for a period of 1-27\u00a0months with a mean survival for primary resection of 24\u00a0months and for post-NACT resection was 17\u00a0months. This difference was not statistically significant (p\u2009=\u20090.38). High-grade serous carcinoma was the most common ovarian cancer in our series, and immunohistochemistry played an important role in the diagnosis. We could not demonstrate any survival benefit of preoperative chemotherapy in our series.",

        "AbstractText": "Long-term quality of life in breast cancer patients has been studied and published regularly. However, the lived experiences of patients who develop complications after surgery are not well understood. Determining this experience of patients is challenging in most low- and middle-income countries where the majority of patients belong to poor strata of society and are uneducated. We aimed to explore the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of patients with surgery-related complications after breast cancer surgery. Purposive sampling was used to identify patients who developed any postoperative complication, and semi-structured interviews were conducted. Common patterns of patient experiences were identified and analyzed using descriptive thematic analysis. Twenty-eight patients out of 210 developing complications postoperatively were identified. The median age was 48\u00a0years (range 32-65\u00a0years). The majority (n\u2009=\u200926) were housewives, educated below the primary level (n\u2009=\u200911) and below the poverty line (n\u2009=\u200913). Complications included seroma (n\u2009=\u200917), flap necrosis and infection (n\u2009=\u20095), and hematoma (n\u2009=\u20091). Seven domains emerged from the interviews-knowledge of complications, psychological impact, burden, disruptiveness, social impact, relationship with the surgical team, and suggestions to improve the experience. The themes identified in the present study provide insights into the lived experiences and can inform the future development of patient-reported outcome measures and quality improvement programs, including more effective pre-operative counseling and consent.

However, scattering and leaked radiation can deposit a portion of the dose outside the radiation field, which may pose a risk to radiation-sensitive patients, such as pregnant women. Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN) is treated with one of the highest GKRS doses (80-90\u00a0Gy). This study aimed to estimate the risk of secondary cancer induction in the uterus, ovaries, thyroid gland, and eyes of TN patients undergoing GKRS. Radiation doses to the uterus, ovary, eyes, and thyroid gland were measured for 25 female TN patients, with a mean age of 35\u00a0years, utilizing Thermo Luminescent Dosimeters (TLD). The mean absorbed dose for the uterus, ovary, thyroid gland, and eyes were .63 \u00b1 .24, .471 \u00b1 .2, 8.26 \u00b1 1.01, and 10.64 \u00b1 1.08\u00a0cGy, respectively. Lifetime Attributable Risk (LAR) has been calculated using BEIR VII (2006) method. LAR for the uterus, ovary, and thyroid gland was 1, 2, and 23, respectively. The results of this study and its comparison with standard values demonstrate that on average, mean doses to mentioned organs were smaller than their tolerance doses, and there is no limitation to treating patients suffering from TN by GK.",

Preoperative biliary drainage with a self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) is often performed before pancreaticoduodenectomy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the risk factors and impact of preoperative SEMS placement on developing benign HJAS after pancreaticoduodenectomy. We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy at our institution between July 2014 and June 2020. Risk factors for benign HJAS were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. We also compared outcomes of preoperative biliary drainage using SEMS and non-SEMS. Of the 626 included patients, benign HJAS occurred in 36 patients (5.8%). The median follow-up time was 36.7 months (interquartile range, 25.4-57.4 months). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that lack of preoperative biliary drainage, preoperative bile duct diameter <5 mm, and former or current smoking were independent predictors of benign HJAS. In the preoperative biliary drainage group, the rate of preoperative bile duct diameter <5 mm was significantly lower in the SEMS group than in the non-SEMS group (2.0% vs. 12.8%, p = 0.04). Preoperative biliary drainage with SEMS may be useful to maintain bile duct diameter \u22655 mm and to reduce benign HJAS as a result.",

        "AbstractText": "Intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct (IPNBs) represent a rare variant of biliary tumors characterized by a papillary growth within the bile duct lumen. Since their first description in 2001, several classifications have been proposed, mainly based on histopathological, radiological and clinical features, although no specific guidelines addressing their management have been developed. Bile duct neoplasms generally develop through a multistep process, involving different precursor pathways, ranging from the initial lesion, detectable only microscopically, i.e. biliary intraepithelial neoplasia, to the distinctive grades of IPNB until the final stage represented by invasive cholangiocarcinoma. Complex and advanced investigations, mainly relying on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cholangioscopy, are required to reach a correct diagnosis and to define an adequate bile duct mapping, which supports proper treatment. The recently introduced subclassifications of types 1 and 2 highlight the histopathological and clinical aspects of IPNB, as well as their natural evolution with a particular focus on prognosis and survival. Aggressive surgical resection, including hepatectomy, pancreaticoduodenectomy or both, represents the treatment of choice, yielding optimal results in terms of survival, although several endoscopic approaches have been described. IPNBs are newly recognized preinvasive neoplasms of the bile duct with high malignant potential. The novel subclassification of types 1 and 2 defines the histological and clinical aspects, prognosis and survival. Diagnosis is mainly based on MRI and cholangioscopy. Surgical resection represents the mainstay of treatment, although endoscopic resection is currently applied to nonsurgically fit patients. New frontiers in genetic research have identified the processes underlying the carcinogenesis of IPNB, to identify targeted therapies.",

Secondary loss of response is frequently caused by the production of anti-drug antibodies, a well-known problem in IBD patients on biologic treatment. We present a case of IO-IBD treated with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)-guided high-dose anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy, in which dose escalation monitoring was used as a strategy to overcome anti-drug antibodies. A 5-mo-old boy presented with a history of persistent hematochezia from the 10th d of life, as well as relapsing perianal abscess and growth failure. Hypoalbuminemia, anemia, and elevated inflammatory markers were also present. Endoscopic assessment revealed skip lesions with deep colic ulcerations, inflammatory anal sub-stenosis, and deep fissures with persistent abscess. A diagnosis of IO-IBD Crohn-like was made. The patient was initially treated with oral steroids and fistulotomy. After the perianal abscess healed, adalimumab (ADA) was administered with concomitant gradual tapering of steroids. Clinical and biochemical steroid-free remission was achieved with good trough levels. After 3 mo, antibodies to ADA (ATA) were found with undetectable trough levels; therefore, we optimized the therapy schedule, first administering 10 mg weekly and subsequently up to 20 mg weekly (2.8 mg/kg/dose). After 2 mo of high-dose treatment, ATA disappeared, with concomitant high trough levels and stable clinical and biochemical remission of the disease. TDM-guided high-dose ADA treatment as a monotherapy overcame ATA production. This strategy could be a good alternative to combination therapy, especially in very young patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Somatic and germline pathogenic variants in genes of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway are a common mechanism underlying a subset of focal malformations of cortical development (FMCDs) referred to as mTORopathies, which include focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II, subtypes of polymicrogyria, and hemimegalencephaly. Our objective is to screen resected FMCD specimens with mTORopathy features on histology for causal somatic variants in mTOR pathway genes, describe novel pathogenic variants, and examine the variant distribution in relation to neuroimaging, histopathologic classification, and clinical outcomes. We performed ultra-deep sequencing using a custom HaloPlexHS Target Enrichment kit in DNA from 21 resected fresh-frozen histologically confirmed FCD type II, tuberous sclerosis complex, or hemimegalencephaly specimens. We mapped the variant alternative allele frequency (AAF) across the resected brain using targeted ultra-deep sequencing in multiple formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. We also functionally validated 2 candidate somatic MTOR variants and performed targeted RNA sequencing to validate a splicing defect associated with a novel DEPDC5 variant. We identified causal mTOR pathway gene variants in 66.7% (14/21) of patients, of which 13 were somatic with AAF ranging between 0.6% and 12.0%. Moreover, the AAF did not predict balloon cell presence. Favorable seizure outcomes were associated with genetically clear resection borders. Individuals in whom a causal somatic variant was undetected had excellent postsurgical outcomes. In addition, we demonstrate pathogenicity of the novel c.4373_4375dupATG and candidate c.7499T>A MTOR variants in vitro. We also identified a novel germline aberrant splice site variant in DEPDC5 (c.2802-1G>C). The AAF of somatic pathogenic variants correlated with the topographic distribution, histopathology, and postsurgical outcomes. Moreover, cortical regions with absent histologic FCD features had negligible or undetectable pathogenic variant loads. By contrast, specimens with frank histologic abnormalities had detectable pathogenic variant loads, which raises important questions as to whether there is a tolerable variant threshold and whether surgical margins should be clean, as performed in tumor resections. In addition, we describe 2 novel pathogenic variants, expanding the mTORopathy genetic spectrum. Although most pathogenic somatic variants are located at mutation hotspots, screening the full-coding gene sequence remains necessary in a subset of patients.",

In each case, pericardial effusion was detected in a patient who was undergoing palliative anticancer therapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive MBC. The patients in these cases were successfully treated with pericardiocentesis and AIT (prednisolone and colchicine) for subsequent CP without substitution with their systemic anticancer drugs.

Understanding sources of distress is crucial in providing comprehensive care. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between delays in breast cancer diagnosis and patient-reported distress. Secondary outcomes include assessing patient characteristics associated with delay. Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who completed a distress screening tool at their initial evaluation at an academic institution between 2014 and 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. The tool captured distress levels in the emotional, social, health, and practical domains with scores of \"high distress\" defined by current clinical practice guidelines. Delay from mammogram to biopsy, whether diagnostic or screening mammogram, was defined as >30 days. 745 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients met inclusion criteria. Median time from abnormal mammogram to core biopsy was 12 days, and 11% of patients experienced a delay in diagnosis. The non-delayed group had higher emotional (p = 0.04) and health (p = 0.03) distress than the delayed group. No statistically significant differences in social distress were found between groups. Additionally, patients with higher practical distress had longer time interval between mammogram and surgical intervention compared to those with lower practical distress. Older age, diagnoses of invasive lobular carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ, and clinical anatomic stages 0-I were associated with diagnostic delay. Patients with higher emotional or health-related distress were more likely to have timely diagnoses of breast cancer, suggesting that patients with higher distress may seek healthcare interventions more promptly. Improved understanding of sources of distress will permit early intervention regarding the devastating impact of breast cancer diagnosis.",

We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases. The trials were eligible if they included premenopausal breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy alone or with concurrent GnRHa and reported ovarian function recovery data. Heterogeneity for the eligible data was assessed, and a pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. A meta-analysis was conducted using a fixed-effect model. Fifteen randomized controlled trials were included in this analysis. The results indicated that GnRHa combined with chemotherapy significantly increased pregnancy rates compared with chemotherapy alone (RR = 1.76; 95% CI: 1.16-2.67) and decreased rates of POF (RR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.35-0.51).

Furthermore, the 5-year DFS and overall survival (OS) rates were significantly improved in the GnRHa group. For premenopausal breast cancer patients receiving gonadal toxic chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy with GnRHa can better protect the ovarian function of patients, reduce the rate of POF and amenorrhea, and improve the pregnancy rate, menstrual recovery rate, DFS rate, and OS rate of patients.",

Methods This is an observational, retrospective study conducted in a tertiary care oncology center from March 2020 to May 2022. We reviewed the prevalence, severity of symptoms, and duration of positivity in relation to blood count laboratory data and mortality with a follow-up of 30 days post-infection for SARS-CoV-2. Results A total of 396 PCR tests were performed on 342 pediatric cancer patients. The overall rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 43.1% (2.7% in the first wave and 95.4% in the second wave). Among 342 screened pediatric cancer patients, 72 patients had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positivity in 92 different episodes. Nearly 59% had a mild or moderate infection, with fever and cough as the predominant presentations. The mean duration of positivity was 18.4\u00b17.76 days.

        "AbstractText": "Globally, childhood cancer, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs), is a prevalent concern. However, the difficulty becomes even more distressing in lower-middle-income nations such as Bangladesh. The insufficiency of research, resources, inadequate guidelines, expensive treatment costs, and specialized knowledge exacerbate the challenges associated with the treatment of certain types of cancers.\u00a0Our investigation looked extensively into the circumstances prevailing in Bangladesh, with the objective of providing a comprehensive overview of the current status and approaches to managing NHL in the country. Through this work, our intention was to illuminate the domains that require immediate focus and assistance. To get insight into the present state of NHL in Bangladesh, our analysis focused on a selection of seven research articles and two case reports published between 2018 and 2023. In order to ensure the integrity and consistency of our review, we conducted a detailed selection procedure, employing the systematic PRISMA review methodology. From a pool of 294 papers, we selected the ones that met our predetermined criteria. These papers were sourced from reputable academic databases, such as Google Scholar and PubMed.\u00a0The findings of our study indicate a higher prevalence of NHL among children in Bangladesh compared to Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Additionally, this phenomenon exhibits a higher prevalence among male individuals. Our study revealed that in Bangladesh, there is a lack of a dedicated guideline or research center specifically focused on NHL. Additionally, the number of research centers and research dedicated to cancer treatment as a whole is limited.\u00a0Our research aims to offer a complete analysis of NHL in the context of Bangladesh, with the intention of offering valuable guidance to healthcare professionals and policymakers. The utilization of our research outcomes has the potential to enhance patient care, facilitate the development of more effective clinical protocols, and promote greater accessibility and affordability of therapies. This has the potential to provide improved cancer care not only in Bangladesh but also in other comparable contexts worldwide.",

The usual presenting symptom is hypothyroidism at the time of diagnosis. Most patients are asymptomatic. A few cases may experience more obvious symptoms. The standard treatment is medical, and surgery is rarely indicated. This review aims to shed light on the most relevant articles discussing surgery in thyroiditis and compare them.\u00a0The author included 16 relevant articles focused on the surgical management of thyroiditis. Of the studies, 10 were designed as retrospective reviews, four as prospective studies, and two as systematic reviews. The included studies aimed to focus on certain objectives. Three of them discussed indications of surgical intervention in cases of thyroiditis. Five covered postoperative complications. Six looked at the thyroid cancer association with thyroiditis. Two explored the impact of thyroiditis on surgery. Five discussed the postoperative improvement of symptoms and the effect on the quality of life. All the studies listed in this review engaged cases of HT except two. This review concentrates on conceptualizing and organizing the parameters in the minds of surgeons who manage cases of thyroiditis to enable them to decide whether to operate or not. These factors are indications of surgery, improvement of local compressor symptoms post thyroidectomy like dysphasia and shortness of breath, risk of thyroid cancer, intraoperative difficulty, and postoperative complications. Different variants of thyroiditis cases are treated medically, and surgery is rarely indicated. The surgeons should consider the mentioned factors affecting their decision to operate on this special entity. Thus, each case should be individualized in deciding whether to operate or not by assessing the benefit-risk ratio.",

This study aimed to investigate the safety and effectiveness of naldemedine for opioid-induced constipation with cancer pain according to specific subgroups of clinical interest. In this exploratory post-hoc subgroup analysis of post-marketing surveillance from Japan (UMIN: 000042851), data were investigated by the subgroups: age (\u226575, <75 years), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS 0-2, 3-4), constipation severity (mild, moderate, severe), brain metastasis (yes, no), anticancer drug treatment (yes, no), opioid at naldemedine initiation (fentanyl only, only strong opioids other than fentanyl, weak opioids only, other), and prior or concomitant use of laxative (only osmotic/saline laxatives, only stimulant laxatives, other, none). Enrolled patients (n = 1184) received naldemedine (0.2 mg once daily) orally for up to 12 weeks. Regarding safety endpoints, the incidence of adverse drug reactions, including diarrhoea, was determined within each subgroup. Regarding effectiveness endpoints, improvement rates in the frequency and condition of bowel movements were investigated by subgroups. The incidence of adverse drug reactions, including diarrhoea, among subgroups ranged from 7.74% to 16.08% (diarrhoea: 5.95% to 13.19%), compared to 11.30% (diarrhoea: 9.09%) in the total population.

However, there is a lack of data about miRNA involved in the regulation of GLUT in OSCC. The objective is to evaluate the role of miRNA in the regulation of GLUT in OSCC. Data sources include PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies evaluating the miRNA involved or associated with the regulation of GLUT in OSCC were included in the systematic review. Data pertaining to GLUT and associated miRNA expression were extracted from studies. Qualitative assessment was carried out for GLUT and miRNA. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for quality assessment. Ten study articles were included after analyzing 4675 papers. These studies evaluated the GLUT and miRNA expression between healthy and OSCC samples. There are variable expression patterns of GLUT in OSCC. Furthermore, it was dependent on miRNA. The GLUT1 and GLUT-3 were detected more frequently in OSCC, while no study reveals the expression of GLUT2, GLUT4, GLUT7, GLUT8, GLUT13, SGLT1, and SGLT2 with miRNA regulation. However, there was insufficient evidence on specific miRNA linked to GLUT1 or GLUT3 expression. There is evidence of the role of miRNA in the regulation of GLUT especially GLUT1 and GLUT3 in OSCC; however, a specific relation to miRNA was understudied.\u00a0In the future, studies exploring a clearer understanding of the association between miRNA and the GLUT metabolic pathway in relation to OSCC are warranted.

        "AbstractText": "Introduction Currently, there is no recommendation for adjustments to the Best Timed Pathway for Prostate cancer (BTiPP) depending on whether the referral is for raised prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or malignant-feeling prostate on digital rectal examination (DRE). Therefore, all patients undergo MRI scanning.\u00a0We aim to establish if patients with abnormal DRE only (without raised PSA) should have an adjusted pathway by comparing the biopsy rate and diagnostic yield after an MRI scan. Methods All BTiPP 2021 referral patient notes were reviewed. The patients were categorized into the aDRE group (abnormal DRE with normal PSA) or the rPSA group (raised PSA with or without abnormal DRE).\u00a0Data and results for MRI and prostate biopsy were evaluated.\u00a0Diagnostic yield was defined as the percentage of patients who underwent an MRI, who were diagnosed with biopsy-proven cancer. Results 68.5% (74/108) and 70.9% (282/398) of patients underwent upfront MRI in the aDRE and rPSA groups, respectively.\u00a0Following MRI, the biopsy rate (28.4% (21/74) vs. 42.9% (121/282) (p=0.02)) and the biopsy-proven diagnostic yield (20.3% (15/74) vs. 36.9% (104/282) (p<0.01)) were both significantly lower in the aDRE group. 58% (43/74) of patients in the aDRE group had no posterior lesions on MRI.\u00a0Only 6.7% (1/15) of biopsy-proven cancers in the aDRE group were solely anterior. Conclusions After MRI, the biopsy rate and diagnostic yield were significantly lower in the aDRE group compared to the rPSA group. Furthermore, a majority of patients referred for aDRE had a normal posterior prostate appearance on MRI. An adjusted pathway for patients referred for aDRE with normal PSA, with DRE by a urologist prior to MRI, should be considered as it would likely reduce unnecessary investigations, treatment, and patient anxiety. These data suggest that this would not risk missing significant cancers.",

Given the extraordinarily low prevalence of extraskeletal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, treatment approaches remain non-standardized. Surgical resection combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy is the most commonly favored strategy by medical teams. In this case report, we present the case of a 72-year-old patient with no specific medical history, who presented with a non-metastatic extraskeletal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma located in the popliteal fossa. The therapeutic intervention encompassed surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. After 18 months of follow-up period, there was no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastases.

        "AbstractText": "Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics in prostate cancer (PCa) offers a game-changing breakthrough with far-reaching implications for diagnosis, treatment, and research. AI-driven algorithms have tremendous promise for assisting early diagnosis by analyzing invisible trends within medical imaging devices such as MRI and ultrasounds. In addition, by evaluating big datasets containing patient data, genetic attributes, and treatment outcomes, these AI algorithms offer the possibility of allowing individualized treatment regimens. This ability to personalize actions to specific patients might improve therapy efficacy while reducing side effects. Robotics can increase accuracy in less invasive surgery, revolutionize therapies like prostatectomies, and improve recovery time for patients. Robotic-assisted procedures provide clinicians with remarkable skills and flexibility, allowing clinicians to negotiate complicated anatomical structures more precisely. However, the symbiotic combination of AI and robotics has several drawbacks. Concerns about data privacy, algorithm biases, and the need to continually assess AI's diagnostic proficiency offer significant hurdles. To ensure patient privacy and data security, the ethical and regulatory aspects of integrating AI and robotics require proper attention. However, combining AI and robotics opens up a galaxy of possibilities. The joint use of AI and robotics can potentially speed up drug development procedures by filtering through massive databases, resulting in the identification of new medicinal compounds. Furthermore, combining AI and robotics might usher in an innovative era of personalized medicine, allowing healthcare providers to design therapies based on detailed patient profiles. The merging of AI and robotics in PCa care gives up unprecedented prospects. While limitations highlight the necessity for caution, the possibilities of better diagnostics, tailored therapies, and new research pathways highlight the transformational abilities of AI and robotics in determining the future of PCa management.

Cancer remains a mystery despite the enormous effort put into understanding the genesis of cancerous cells, the development of malignant tissues, and the process by which they propagate and recur. Cells from humans that have been recruited by cancer and, to some extent, changed into pathogenic organisms or the foundation of tumors serve as agents of destruction. Understanding cancers leads to challenging philosophical issues since they undermine and use multicellular organization processes. Cancer metastasizing cells adopt new phenotypes while discarding previous behaviors. The absence of comprehensive knowledge of this has hampered the development of therapeutics for metastatic illness. For systems-level experimental and computational metastasis modeling, integrating these complex and interconnected features continues to be a problem because metastasis has typically been studied in separate physiological compartments. Lung, breast, and prostate cancers accounted for the bulk of the 18 million new cases of cancer that were diagnosed in 2018. The most frequent cancer in women is breast cancer.

Although various methods have been developed for reconstruction following resection of the proximal humerus, a consensus on which technique is best has not been established. We focused on the sling procedure using a free vascularized fibular graft (FVFG) and conducted what we believe to be the largest retrospective study of patients to undergo this surgery to date. We retrospectively reviewed the data of 19 patients who underwent the sling procedure with use of an FVFG at our hospital between 1998 and 2022. The median age was 20 years, and the median follow-up duration was 63.1 months. Surgical data, oncological outcomes, the postoperative course, complications, and functional outcomes as measured with use of the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score were thoroughly reviewed. The median operative duration was 555 minutes, and the median blood loss was 374 mL. The median length of the bone defect was 17.0 cm, and the median length of the graft was 20.0 cm. With respect to oncological outcomes, 9 patients were continuously disease-free, 9 patients had no evidence of disease, and 1 patient was alive with disease. Bone union was present in 13 of the 17 patients for whom it was evaluable. The median time to bone union was 4 months. Graft growth was observed in 2 pediatric patients. Postoperative fracture was a major complication at the recipient site. The incidence of pseudarthrosis significantly increased when the FVFG could not be inserted into the remaining humeral bone or was split in half (p = 0.002). Although a few patients demonstrated peroneal nerve palsy at the donor site, the symptom was temporary. The overall functional outcome was favorable, with an average MSTS score of 66.9%. The sling procedure demonstrated a low complication rate and a favorable functional outcome overall.

        "AbstractText": "Reactive oxidant species (ROS) are unstable, highly reactive molecules that are produced by cells either as byproducts of metabolism or synthesized by specialized enzymes. ROS can be detrimental, e.g., by damaging cellular macromolecules, or beneficial, e.g., by participating in signaling. An increasing body of evidence shows that various fungal species, including both yeasts and molds, increase ROS production upon exposure to the antifungal drugs currently used in the clinic: azoles, polyenes, and echinocandins. However, the implications of these findings are still largely unclear due to gaps in knowledge regarding the chemical nature, molecular origins, and functional consequences of these ROS. Because the detection of ROS in fungal cells has largely relied on fluorescent probes that lack specificity, the chemical nature of the ROS is not known, and it may vary depending on the specific fungus-drug combination. In several instances, the origin of antifungal drug-induced ROS has been identified as the mitochondria, but further experiments are necessary to strengthen this conclusion and to investigate other potential cellular ROS sources, such as the ER, peroxisomes, and ROS-producing enzymes. With respect to the function of the ROS, several studies have shown that they contribute to the drugs' fungicidal activities and may be part of drug-induced programmed cell death (PCD). However, whether these \"pro-death\" ROS are a primary consequence of the antifungal mechanism of action or a secondary consequence of drug-induced PCD remains unclear. Finally, several recent studies have raised the possibility that ROS induction can serve an adaptive role, promoting antifungal drug tolerance and the evolution of drug resistance. Filling these gaps in knowledge will reveal a new aspect of fungal biology and may identify new ways to potentiate antifungal drug activity or prevent the evolution of antifungal drug resistance.",

        "AbstractText": "There is no direct evidence of gut microbiota disturbance in children with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This study aimed to provide direct evidence and a comprehensive understanding of gut microbiota disturbance in children with GERD through combined metagenomic and metabolomic analysis. 30 children with GERD and 30 healthy controls (HCs) were continuously enrolled, and the demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects were collected. First, 16S rRNA sequencing was used to evaluate differences in the gut microbiota between children with GERD and HC group, and 10 children with GERD and 10 children in the HC group were selected for metagenomic analysis. Nontargeted metabolomic analysis was performed using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), and metagenomic and metabolomic data were analyzed together. There were significant differences in the gut microbiota diversity and composition between children with GERD and HCs. The dominant bacteria in children with GERD were Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota. At the species level, the top three core bacterial groups were Bacteroides stercoris, Bacteroides vulgatus and Alistipes putredinis. The main differential pathways were identified to be related to energy, amino acid, vitamin, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. LC/MS detected 288 different metabolites in the positive and negative ion modes between children with GERD and HCs, which were mainly involved in arachidonic acid (AA), tyrosine, glutathione and caffeine metabolism. This study provides new evidence of the pathogenesis of GERD. There are significant differences in the gut microbiota, metabolites and metabolic pathways between HCs and children with GERD, and the differences in metabolites are related to specific changes in bacterial abundance. In the future, GERD may be treated by targeting specific bacteria related to AA metabolism.",

        "AbstractText": "Human Dual specificity tyrosine (Y)-Regulated Kinase 1A (DYRK1A) is encoded by a dosage-dependent gene located in the Down syndrome critical region of human chromosome 21. The known substrates of DYRK1A include proteins involved in transcription, cell cycle control, DNA repair and other processes. However, the function and regulation of this kinase is not fully understood, and the current knowledge does not fully explain the dosage-dependent function of this kinase. Several recent proteomic studies identified DYRK1A interacting proteins in several human cell lines. Interestingly, several of known protein substrates of DYRK1A were undetectable in these studies, likely due to a transient nature of the kinase-substrate interaction. It is possible that the stronger-binding DYRK1A interacting proteins, many of which are poorly characterized, are involved in regulatory functions by recruiting DYRK1A to the specific subcellular compartments or distinct signaling pathways. Better understanding of these DYRK1A-interacting proteins could help to decode the cellular processes regulated by this important protein kinase during embryonic development and in the adult organism. Here, we review the current knowledge of the biochemical and functional characterization of the DYRK1A protein-protein interaction network and discuss its involvement in human disease.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Secretome analysis of breast cancer cells to identify potential target proteins of Ipomoea turpethum extract-loaded nanoparticles in the tumor microenvironment.",
        "AbstractText": "Background: Breast cancer is the leading cause of frequent malignancy and morbidity among women across the globe, with an increment of 0.5% incidences every year. The deleterious effects of traditional treatment on off-target surrounding cells make it difficult to win the battle against breast cancer. Hence, an advancement in the therapeutic approach is crucial. Nanotechnology is one of the emerging methods for precise, targeted, and efficient drug delivery in cells. The previous study has demonstrated the cytotoxic effect of Ipomoea turpethum extract on breast cancer cells delivered via NIPAAM-VP-AA nanoparticles (NVA-IT). Manipulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) to inhibit cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis seems to be very insightful for researchers these days. With the help of secretome analysis of breast cancer cells after treatment with NVA-IT, we have tried to find out the possible TME manipulation achieved to favor a better prognosis of the disease. Method: MCF-7 and MDA MB-231 cells were treated with the IC50 value of NVA-IT, and the medium was separated from the cells after 24\u00a0h of the treatment. Nano LCMS/MS analysis was performed to identify the secretory proteins in the media. Further bioinformatics tools like GENT2, GSCA, GeneCodis 4, and STRING were used to identify the key proteins and their interactions. Result: From the nano LCMS/MS analysis, 70 differentially expressed secretory proteins in MCF-7 and 191 in MDA MB-231 were identified in the cell's media. Fifteen key target proteins were filtered using bioinformatics analysis, and the interaction of proteins involved in vesicular trafficking, cell cycle checkpoints, and oxidative stress-related proteins was prominent. Conclusion: This study concluded that I. turpethum extract-loaded NIPAAM-VP-AA nanoparticles alter the secretory proteins constituting the TME to cease cancer cell growth and metastasis.",

The prevalence of breast cancer has been observed to rise in China, accompanied by an earlier age of onset when compared to Western countries. Breast cancer continues to be a prominent contributor to cancer-related mortality and morbidity among women, primarily due to its limited responsiveness to conventional treatment modalities. The diagnostic process is challenging due to the presence of non-specific clinical manifestations and the suboptimal precision of conventional diagnostic tests. There is a prevailing uncertainty regarding the most effective screening method and target populations, as well as the specificities and execution of screening programs. To identify diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer. Overlapping differentially expressed genes were screened based on Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE36765, GSE10810, and GSE20086) and The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. A protein-protein interaction network was applied to excavate the hub genes among these differentially expressed genes. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses, as well as gene set enrichment analyses, were conducted to examine the functions of these genes and their potential mechanisms in the development of breast cancer. For clarification of the diagnostic and prognostic roles of these genes, Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses were conducted. This study demonstrated that calreticulin, heat shock protein family B member 1, insulin-like growth Factor 1, interleukin-1 receptor 1, Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, and triosephosphate isomerase 1 are potential diagnostic biomarkers of breast cancer as well as potential treatment targets with clinical implications.

The rapid growth and metabolism required for survival result in tumors exhibiting an increased demand for amino acids. An abundant supply of amino acids is important for cancer to maintain its proliferative driving force. Changes in amino acid metabolism can be used to screen malignant tumors and improve therapeutic outcomes.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is secreted by the pituitary gland, which has a significant impact on thyroid gland function. Excessively high or low TSH levels may be associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Thus, in-depth studies on the association of serum Tg and TSH levels with thyroid cancer risk in patients with thyroid nodules are warranted. This can help determine whether Tg and TSH levels can predict the degree of malignancy of thyroid nodules, which can in turn guide doctors in making accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions. Furthermore, such studies can provide more accurate diagnostic methods for thyroid nodules and help patients become aware of the presence of thyroid cancer as early as possible, thereby improving the success rate of treatment and prognosis. To investigate the association of serum Tg and TSH levels with the risk of thyroid cancer in patients undergoing thyroid nodule surgery. The clinical data and laboratory examination results of 130 patients who underwent thyroid nodule surgery were retrospectively analyzed. Furthermore, their preoperative serum Tg and TSH levels were recorded. Histopathological examination conducted during follow-up revealed the presence of thyroid cancer. Correlation analysis were used to analyze the association of Tg and TSH levels with the risk of thyroid cancer. Of the 130 patients, 60 were diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Statistical analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between serum Tg levels and the risk of thyroid cancer (P < 0.05). This suggests that high serum Tg levels are associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. However, no significant correlation was observed between serum TSH levels and the risk of thyroid cancer (P > 0.05). In patients who underwent thyroid nodule surgery, serum Tg levels exhibited a significant correlation with the risk of thyroid cancer but serum TSH levels did not.

Core transcriptional regulatory circuitry (CRC) consists of autoregulated transcription factors (TFs) and their enhancers, which dominate gene expression programs and control cell fate. However, there is limited knowledge of CRC in TNBC. Herein, we systemically characterized the activated super-enhancers (SEs) and interrogated 14 CRCs in breast cancer. We found that CRCs could be broadly involved in DNA conformation change, metabolism process, and signaling response affecting the gene expression reprogramming. Furthermore, these CRC TFs are capable of coordinating with partner TFs bridging the enhancer-promoter loops. Notably, the CRC TF and partner pairs show remarkable specificity for molecular subtypes of breast cancer, especially in TNBC. USF1, SOX4, and MYBL2 were identified as the TNBC-specific CRC TFs. We further demonstrated that USF1 was a TNBC immunophenotype-related TF.

It is the most common cancer among women, with an incidence rate of 2.26 million cases worldwide. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes and isoform switching between estrogen receptor positive and triple negative BC samples. Methods: The data were collected from ArrayExpress, followed by preprocessing and subsequent mapping from HISAT2. Read quantification was performed by StringTie, and then R package ballgown was used to perform differential expression analysis. Functional enrichment analysis was conducted using Enrichr, and then immune genes were shortlisted based on the ScType marker database. Isoform switch analysis was also performed using the IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR package. Results: A total of 9,771 differentially expressed genes were identified, of which 86 were upregulated and 117 were downregulated. Six genes were identified as mainly associated with estrogen receptor positive BC, while a novel set of ten genes were found which have not previously been reported in estrogen receptor positive BC. Furthermore, alternative splicing and subsequent isoform usage in the immune system related genes were determined. Conclusion: This study identified the differential usage of isoforms in the immune system related genes in cancer cells that suggest immunosuppression due to the dysregulation of CXCR chemokine receptor binding, iron ion binding, and cytokine activity.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Unidirectional alteration of methylation and hydroxymethylation at the promoters and differential gene expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma.",
        "AbstractText": "Background: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. Although overall losses of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) have been previously observed, a genome-wide, single-base-resolution, and simultaneous mapping of 5mC and 5hmC in OSCC is still unaccomplished. Similarly, the mechanism of how 5mC and 5hmC collectively lead to abnormal gene expression in OSCC is largely unexplored. Using parallel whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and whole-genome oxidative bisulfite sequencing (oxWGBS), we characterized 5mC- and 5hmC-profiles at single-nucleotide resolution in paired primary OSCC samples and their normal adjacent tissues (NATs). We also analyzed the effect of 5mC- and 5hmC-modifications on differential gene expression in OSCC using multi-omics analysis. Results: An overall reduction of both 5mC and 5hmC in various genomic regions have been observed in OSCC samples. At promoter regions, a total of 6,921 differentially methylated regions and 1,024 differentially hydroxymethylated regions were identified in OSCC. Interestingly, compared to bidirectional modification with 5mC and 5hmC, unidirectional modification with 5mC and 5hmC at the promoters is associated with bigger change in the gene expression. Additionally, genes bearing unidirectional modification with 5mC and 5hmC at the promoters are enriched in signaling pathways like cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and receptor tyrosine kinase pathway that are essential for the tumorigenesis. Finally, the grouped expression signature of top 20 genes bearing promoter-unidirectional-modification with 5mC and 5hmC tends to correlate with the clinical outcome of certain subtypes of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Conclusion: Using parallel WGBS and oxWGBS analyses, we observed an overall reduction of 5mC- and 5hmC-modifications at various genomic regions in OSCC. Unidirectional modification with 5mC and 5hmC at the promoters is associated with enhanced changes in gene expression in OSCC tissues. Furthermore, such differentially expressed genes bearing unidirectional modifications with 5mC and 5hmC at the promoters might have clinical relevance to the outcome of OSCC.",

        "AbstractText": "Cancer has been one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide over the past few years. Some progress has been made in the development of more effective cancer therapeutics, resulting in improved survival rates. However, the desired outcome in the form of successful treatment is yet to be achieved. There is high demand for the development of innovative, inexpensive, and effective anticancer treatments using natural resources. Natural compounds have been increasingly discovered and used for cancer therapy owing to their high molecular diversity, novel biofunctionality, and minimal side effects. These compounds can be utilized as chemopreventive agents because they can efficiently inhibit cell growth, control cell cycle progression, and block several tumor-promoting signaling pathways. PI3K is an important upstream protein of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and a well-established cancer therapeutic target. This study aimed to explore the small molecules, natural flavonoids, viz. quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, genistein, wogonin, daidzein, and flavopiridol for PI3K\u03b3 kinase activity inhibition. In this study, the binding pose, interacting residues, molecular interactions, binding energies, and dissociation constants were investigated. Our results showed that these flavonoids bound well with PI3K\u03b3 with adequate binding strength scores and binding energy ranging from (-8.19 to -8.97\u00a0Kcal/mol). Among the explored ligands, flavopiridol showed the highest binding energy of -8.97\u00a0Kcal/mol, dock score (-44.40), and dissociation constant term, pKd of 6.58 against PI3K\u03b3. Based on the above results, the stability of the most promising ligand, flavopiridol, against PI3K\u03b3 was evaluated by molecular dynamics simulations for 200\u00a0ns, confirming the stable flavopiridol and PI3K\u03b3 complex. Our study suggests that among the selected flavonoids specifically flavopiridol may act as potential inhibitors of PI3K\u03b3 and could be a therapeutic alternative to inhibit the PI3K\u03b3 pathway, providing new insights into rational drug discovery research for cancer therapy.",

        "AbstractText": "Background: Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CCA) is a highly aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. However, there are no consensus treatment guidelines, and decisions are usually extrapolated from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Given that cHCC-CCA owns the unequivocal presence of both hepatocytic and cholangiocytic differentiation, a combination regimen of anti-PD1 antibody, multikinase inhibitor, and chemotherapy targeting against both components might be an optimal choice. Case presentation: We present the case of a patient with postoperative metastatic chemotherapy-resistant cHCC-CCA who exhibited a durable response and reasonable tolerability to a combination therapy consisting of the anti-PD1 antibody sintilimab, multikinase inhibitor lenvatinib, and nab-paclitaxel, despite having a low tumor mutational burden (TMB-L), microsatellite stability (MSS), and negative programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). Conclusion: The combination regimen of immune checkpoint inhibitor sintilimab, multikinase inhibitor lenvatinib, and chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel, which targets both the HCC and ICC components, may represent a promising treatment option for patients with cHCC-CCA. Further research is warranted to validate these findings in larger patient cohorts.",

Methods: The systems were selected based on recommendations issued by the Polish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Tariffication (AHTAPol), which explicitly referred to other countries and agencies). Consequently, apart from Poland, the countries included in the analysis were England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France, Netherlands, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Relevant information and data were collected through a systematic search of PubMed (Medline), Embase and The Cochrane Library as well as competent authority websites and grey literature sources. Results and discussion: In most of the countries, the submission of a reimbursement application is initiated by a pharmaceutical company, and only a few countries allow it before a product is approved for marketing. All of the agencies analyzed are independent and some have regulatory function of reimbursement decision making body. A key criterion differentiating the various agencies in terms of HTA is the cost-effectiveness threshold. Most of the countries have specific mechanisms to improve access to expensive specialty drugs, including cancer drugs and those used for rare diseases. Reimbursement systems often lack consistency in appreciating the same stages, leading to heterogeneous decision-making processes. The analysis of recommendations issued in different countries for the same medicinal product will allow a better understanding of the relations between the reimbursement system, HTA assessment, stakeholders involvement and decision on reimbursement of innovative drugs.",

Initially, it was shown that AE exerts an anti-inflammatory effect. Further studies revealed its antitumor activity against various types of cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying these properties remain unclear. Based on network pharmacology and molecular docking, this study investigated the molecular mechanism of AE in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and evaluated its therapeutic effect through in vitro experiments. Methods: CTD, Pharmmapper, SuperPred and TargetNet were the databases to obtain potential drug-related targets. DisGenet, GeneCards, OMIM and TTD were used to identify potential disease-related targets. Intersection genes for drugs and diseases were obtained through the Venn diagram. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses of intersecting genes were conducted by the website of Bioinformatics. Intersection genes were introduced into STRING to construct a protein-protein interaction network, while the Cytoscape3.9.1 software was used to visualize and analyze the core targets. AutoDock4.2.6 was utilized to achieve molecular docking between drug and core targets. In vitro experiments investigated the therapeutic effects and related mechanisms of AE. Results: 63 overlapped genes were obtained and GO analysis generated 3,646 entries by these 63 intersecting genes. KEGG analysis mainly involved apoptosis, proteoglycans in cancer, TNF signaling pathway, TP53 signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, etc. AKT1, EGFR, ESR1, TP53, and SRC have been identified as core targets because the binding energies of them between aloe-emodin were less than -5\u00a0kcal/Mol.The mRNA and protein expression, prognosis, mutation status, and immune infiltration related to core targets were further revealed. The involvement of AKT1 and EGFR, as well as the key target of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, indicated the importance of this signaling pathway in the treatment of HCC using AE. The results of the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and flow analysis demonstrated the therapeutic effect of AE. The downregulation of EGFR, PI3KR1, AKT1, and BCL2 in mRNA expression and PI3KR1, AKT,p-AKT in protein expression confirmed our hypothesis. Conclusion: Based on network pharmacology and molecular docking, our study initially showed that AE exerted a therapeutic effect on HCC by modulating multiple signaling pathways. Various analyses confirmed the antiproliferative activity and pro-apoptotic effect of AE on HCC through the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. This study revealed the therapeutic mechanism of AE in the treatment of HCC through a novel approach, providing a theoretical basis for the clinical application of AE.",

        "AbstractText": "Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is among the most prevalent cancers worldwide, ranking as the third most prevalent malignancy in incidence and mortality. The somatostatin receptor (SSTR) family comprises G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which couple to inhibitory G proteins (Gi and Go) upon binding to somatostatin (SST) analogs. GPCRs are involved in hormone release, neurotransmission, cell growth inhibition, and cancer suppression. However, their roles in COAD remain unclear. This study used bioinformatics to investigate the expression, prognosis, gene alterations, functional enrichment, and immunoregulatory effects of the SSTR family members in COAD. SSTR1-4 are differentially downregulated in COAD, and low SSTR2 expression indicates poor survival. Biological processes and gene expression enrichment of the SSTR family in COAD were further analyzed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology. A strong correlation was observed between SSTR expression and immune cell infiltration. We also quantified SSTR2 expression in 25 COAD samples and adjacent normal tissues using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We analyzed its correlation with the dendritic cell-integrin subunit alpha X marker gene. The biomarker exploration of the solid tumors portal was used to confirm the correlation between SSTR2 with immunomodulators and immunotherapy responses. Our results identify SSTR2 as a promising target for COAD immunotherapy. Our findings provide new insights into the biological functions of the SSTR family and their implications for the prognosis of COAD.",

        "AbstractText": "The effect of combination therapies in many cancers has often been shown to be superior to that of monotherapies. This success is commonly attributed to drug synergies. Combinations of two (or more) drugs in xenograft tumor growth inhibition (TGI) studies are typically designed at fixed doses for each compound. The available methods for assessing synergy in such study designs are based on combination indices (CI) and model-based analyses. The former methods are suitable for screening exercises but are difficult to verify in in vivo studies, while the latter incorporate drug synergy in semi-mechanistic frameworks describing disease progression and drug action but are unsuitable for screening. In the current study, we proposed the empirical radius additivity (Rad-add) score, a novel CI for synergy detection in fixed-dose xenograft TGI combination studies. The Rad-add score approximates model-based analysis performed using the semi-mechanistic constant-radius growth TGI model. The Rad-add score was compared with response additivity, defined as the addition of the two response values, and the bliss independence model in combination studies derived from the Novartis PDX dataset. The results showed that the bliss independence and response additivity models predicted synergistic interactions with high and low probabilities, respectively. The Rad-add score predicted synergistic probabilities that appeared to be between those predicted with response additivity and the Bliss model. We believe that the Rad-add score is particularly suitable for assessing synergy in the context of xenograft combination TGI studies, as it combines the advantages of CI approaches suitable for screening exercises with those of semi-mechanistic TGI models based on a mechanistic understanding of tumor growth.",

Moreover, African American men experience disproportionately high mortality rates due to PCa. This study delves into the pivotal role of SPDEF, a prostate specific Ets transcription factor, and its regulation by DNA methylation in the context of PCa progression. We performed Epigenetic reprogramming using daily treatment with non-toxic dose of 5Aza-2-deoxycytidine (5Aza-dC) for two weeks to assess its impact on PDEF expression in prostate cancer cells. Next, we conducted functional studies on reprogrammed cells, including cell migration (wound-healing assay), invasion (Boyden-Chamber test), and proliferation (MTT assay) to comprehensively evaluate the consequences of altered PDEF expression. We used bisulfite sequencing (BSP) to examine DNA methylation at SPDEF promoter. Simultaneously, we utilized siRNA-mediated targeting of key DNMTs (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B) to elucidate their specific role in regulating PDEF. We measured mRNA and protein expressions using qRT-PCR and immune-blotting techniques, respectively. In this report, we observed that: a) there is a gradual decrease in SPDEF expression with a concomitant increase in methylated CpG sites within the SPDEF gene during prostate cancer progression from lower to higher Gleason grade; b) Expression of DNMT's (DNMT1, 3a and 3b) is increased during prostate cancer progression, and there is an inverse correlation between SPDEF and DNMT expression; c) SPDEF levels are decreased in RC77/T, a line of PCa cells from African American origin similar to PC3 and DU145 cells (CRPC cells), as compared to LNCaP cells , a line of androgen dependent cells,; d) the 5' CpG island of SPDEF gene are hypermethylated in SPDEF-negative CRPC ( PC3, DU145 and RC77/T) cell lines but the same regions are hypomethylated in SPDEF-positive castrate sensitive (LNCaP) cell line ; (e) expression of SPDEF in PCa cells lacking SPDEF decreases cell migration and invasion, but has no significant effect on cell proliferation, and; (f) treatment with the demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, or silencing of the DNMT's by siRNA, partially restores SPDEF expression in SPDEF-negative PCa cell lines, and decreases cell migration and invasion. These results indicate hypermethylation is a prevalent mechanism for decreasing SPDEF expression during prostate cancer progression. The data demonstrate that loss of SPDEF expression in prostate cancer cells, a critical step in cellular plasticity, results from a potentially reversible process of aberrant DNA methylation. These studies suggest DMNT activity as a potential therapeutic vulnerability that can be exploited for limiting cellular plasticity, tumor progression, and therapy resistance in prostate cancer.",

However, systematic metabolic changes of post-operative PTC patients were rarely reported. Here, untargeted metabolomic detection of cohorts from PTC before (t0) and 1-month-after (t1) thyroidectomy, were performed to characterize circulating metabolic signatures after surgical treatment. Our results showed PTC patients exhibited lower thyroid stimulating hormone degree, higher total thyroxine, and significant lipid-related metabolic alternations after thyroidectomy, which included 97 upregulations (including 93 lipids) and 5 downregulations (including 2 lipids and 3 nucleotides). Enrichment of metabolic pathways mainly included biosynthesis of fatty acids, purine metabolism, and linoleic acid metabolism. We also demonstrated that differential surgical approaches (hemi- and total thyroidectomy) and post-operative complication phenotypes (insomnia, fatigue), might lead to characteristic metabolic signatures. This study revealed dynamic changes of metabolite characteristics of PTC patients after surgical treatment, which were associated with clinical thyroid function parameters, surgical approaches, and complication occurrence.

        "AbstractText": "High relapse rates remain a clinical challenge in the management of breast cancer (BC), with distant recurrence being a major driver of patient deterioration. To optimize the surveillance regimen for distant recurrence after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), we conducted a comprehensive analysis using bioinformatics and machine learning approaches. Microarray data were retrieved from the GEO database, and differential expression analysis was performed with the R package 'Limma'. We used the Metascape tool for enrichment analyses, and 'WGCNA' was utilized to establish co-expression networks, selecting the soft threshold power with the 'pickSoftThreshold' algorithm. We integrated ten machine learning algorithms and 101 algorithm combinations to identify key genes associated with distant recurrence in BC. Unsupervised clustering was performed with the R package 'ConsensusCluster Plus'. To further screen the key gene signature of residual cancer burden (RCB), multiple knockdown studies were analyzed with the Genetic Perturbation Similarity Analysis (GPSA) database. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis was conducted through the Tumour Immune Single-cell Hub (TISCH) database, and the XSum algorithm was used to screen candidate small molecule drugs based on the Connectivity Map (CMAP) database. Molecular docking processes were conducted using Schrodinger software. GMT files containing gene sets associated with metabolism and senescence were obtained from GSEA MutSigDB database. The GSVA score for each gene set across diverse samples was computed using the ssGSEA function implemented in the GSVA package. Our analysis, which combined Limma, WGCNA, and machine learning approaches, identified 16 RCB-relevant gene signatures influencing distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) in BC patients following NAC. We then screened GATA3 as the key gene signature of high RCB index using GPSA analysis. A novel molecular subtyping scheme was developed to divide patients into two clusters (C1 and C2) with different distant recurrence risks. This molecular subtyping scheme was found to be closely associated with tumor metabolism and cellular senescence. Patients in cluster C2 had a poorer DRFS than those in cluster C1 (HR: 4.04; 95% CI: 2.60-6.29; log-rank test p < 0.0001). High GATA3 expression, high levels of resting mast cell infiltration, and a high proportion of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive patients contributed to better DRFS in cluster C1. We established a nomogram based on the N stage, RCB class, and molecular subtyping. The ROC curve for 5-year DRFS showed excellent predictive value (AUC=0.91, 95% CI: 0.95-0.86), with a C-index of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81-0.90). Entinostat was identified as a potential small molecule compound to reverse high RCB after NAC. We also provided a comprehensive review of the EDCs exposures that potentially impact the effectiveness of NAC among BC patients. This study established a molecular classification scheme associated with tumor metabolism and cancer cell senescence to predict RCB and DRFS in BC patients after NAC. Furthermore, GATA3 was identified and validated as a key gene associated with BC recurrence.",

This review provides a comprehensive overview of BAM15, including its mechanism of action and potential therapeutic applications in diverse disease contexts. BAM15 has shown promise in obesity by increasing energy expenditure and reducing fat accumulation. In diabetes, it improves glycemic control and reverses insulin resistance. Additionally, BAM15 has potential in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, sepsis, and cardiovascular diseases by mitigating oxidative stress, modulating inflammatory responses, and promoting cardioprotection. The safety profile of BAM15 is encouraging, with minimal adverse effects and remarkable tolerability. However, challenges such as its high lipophilicity and the need for alternative delivery methods need to be addressed.

Participants with diabetes in the UK Biobank prospective cohort were divided into four groups: \u226440, 41-50, 51-60, and >60 years according to age at diagnosis. A total of 26,318 diabetics and 105,272 controls (1:4 randomly selected for each diabetic matched by the same baseline age) were included. We calculated the incidence density, standardized incidence, and mortality rates of cancer. Cox proportional hazard model was used to examine the associations of diabetes at different diagnostic ages with cancer incidence and mortality, followed by subgroup analyses. Compared to corresponding controls, standardized incidence and mortality rates of overall and digestive system cancers were higher in diabetes diagnosed at age 41-50, 51-60, and >60 years, especially at 51-60 years. Individuals diagnosed with diabetes at different ages were at higher risk to develop site-specific cancers, with a prominently increased risk of liver cancer since the diagnosis age of >40 years. Significantly, participants with diabetes diagnosed at 51-60 years were correlated with various site-specific cancer risks [hazard ratio (HR) for incidence: 1.088-2.416, HR for mortality: 1.276-3.269]. Moreover, for mortality of digestive system cancers, we observed an interaction effect between smoking and diabetes diagnosed at 51-60 years.

With the widespread application of endoscopic technologies, the need for early detection and diagnosis of esophageal cancer has gradually been realized. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has become the standard of care for managing early tumors of the esophagus, stomach, and colon. However, due to the steep learning curve, difficult operation, and technically demanding nature of the procedure, ESD has currently been committed to the development of various assistive technologies. To explore the feasibility and applicability of magnetic anchor technique (MAT)-assisted ESD for early esophageal cancer. Isolated pig esophagi were used as the experimental model, and the magnetic anchor device was designed by us. The esophagi used were divided into two groups, namely the operational and control groups, and 10 endoscopists completed the procedure. The two groups were evaluated for the following aspects: The total operative time, perforation rate, rate of whole mucosal resection, diameter of the peering mucosa, and scores of endoscopists' feelings with the procedure, including the convenience, mucosal surface exposure degree, and tissue tension. In addition, in the operational group, the soft tissue clip and the target magnet (TM) were connected by a thin wire through a small hole at the tail end of the TM. Under gastroscopic guidance, the soft tissue clip was clamped to the edge of the lesioned mucosa, which was marked in advance. By changing the position of the anchor magnet (AM) outside the esophagus, the pulling force and pulling direction of the TM could be changed, thus exposing the mucosal peeling surface and assisting the ESD. Herein, each of the two groups comprised 10 isolated esophageal putative mucosal lesions. The diameter of the peering mucosa did not significantly differ between the two groups (2.13 \u00b1 0.06 vs 2.15 \u00b1 0.06, P = 0.882). The total operative time was shorter in the operational group than in the control group (17.04 \u00b1 0.22 min vs 21.94 \u00b1 0.23 min, P < 0.001). During the entire experiment, the TM remained firmly connected with the soft tissue clip and did not affect the opening, closing, and release of the soft tissue clip. The interaction between the TM and AM could provide sufficient tissue tension and completely expose the mucosa, which greatly assists the surgeon with the operation. There was no avulsion of the mucosa, and mucosal lesions were intact when peeled. Therefore, the scores of endoscopists' feelings were higher in the operational group than in the control group in terms of the convenience (9.22 \u00b1 0.19 vs 8.34 \u00b1 0.15, P = 0.002), mucosal surface exposure degree (9.11 \u00b1 0.15 vs 8.25 \u00b1 0.12, P < 0.001), and tissue tension (9.35 \u00b1 0.13 vs 8.02 \u00b1 0.17, P < 0.001). The two groups did not significantly differ in the perforation rate and rate of whole mucosal resection. We found MAT-assisted ESD safe and feasible for early esophageal cancer. It could greatly improve the endoscopic operation experience and showed good clinical application prospects.",

        "AbstractText": "Pituitary adenomas are one of the most common types of primary intracranial tumors. Measuring pituitary adenoma volume is fundamental for effective management. This study aimed to assess the reliability of the ellipsoid method in comparison with the perimeter method for measuring pituitary macroadenoma volume. In addition, we investigated the correlation between adenoma size reduction and biochemical control in functioning adenomas. This was a retrospective cross-sectional cohort study including 113 patients with pituitary macroadenomas. MRI was obtained for volume measurement by ellipsoid and perimeter methods using two types of DICOM viewer software. Both ellipsoid and perimeter methods exhibit positive, strong, and significant correlations in pituitary macroadenomas in pre-treatment and post-treatment volume (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.95, p-value <0.0001). There was no significant difference in the mean post-treatment pituitary adenoma volume measurements utilizing the ellipsoid and the perimeter methods in different treatment modalities. There were significant differences in the pre-treatment volume measurements between the two methods, both in NFPA and prolactinoma. No correlation was found between volume variability measured by ellipsoid and perimeter methods and the degree of hormonal control in functioning pituitary adenomas. Both the ellipsoid and perimetric methods can be utilized for pituitary adenoma volume measurements as they demonstrate a strong and positive correlation. However, it is important to note that the ellipsoid method tends to result in overestimated tumor volume. There was no correlation between the adenoma size reduction and the degree of biochemical response in functioning adenomas.",

Laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) is commonly used to treat PCOS, especially when drug interventions have failed. This study aimed to evaluate the response to LOD intervention in women with PCOS by assessing AMH serum levels and their ability to restore normal physiological menstrual cycle and achieve conception. Seventy-five infertile women (24-41 years old) with body mass index (BMI) ranging from 19.6-35kg/m2 were included in the study. Among them, 57 had primary infertility, and 18 from secondary infertility, with an average duration of 8.6\u00b14.4 years. Baseline levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and AMH were measured, and post-LOD levels of LH and AMH were evaluated. Menstrual cycle regularity was evaluated before and after LOD. Baseline FSH serum level before LOD was 5.2-1.6IU/L. Following LOD, the serum levels of LH and AMH significantly decreased from 14.3\u00b14.1 to 7.8\u00b12.8 IU/L and from 13.7\u00b15.9 to 7.7\u00b13.9 IU/L, respectively (p<0.05). LOD significantly (p<0.05) decreased the menstrual cycles irregularity, such as oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea, from 55 (73.3%) to 22 (29.3%) women and from 2 (2.7%) to 0 (0%) women respectively. Moreover, regular menstrual cycles significantly (p<0.05) increased from 18 (24%) to 53 (70.7%) women. Importantly, 68% of LOD-treated women showed a significant increase in pregnancy rates, with 52.9%, 35.3%, and 11.8% achieving pregnancy within 3, 6, and 9 months after LOD, respectively (p<0.05). Moreover, spontaneous ovulation was observed in 7/75 (9.3%) women within 90 days after LOD, and 71.4% achieved pregnancy. These findings highlight the success of laparoscopic ovarian drilling as an intervention for PCOS, with AMH serving as a reliable test to assess the response to LOD treatment.",

Despite significant therapeutic advancements, approximately 25% of breast carcinoma cases have resistance to current treatment modalities, posing a significant challenge for patient management. This study aimed to investigate the role of Sam68 mRNA and its protein in promoting oncogenesis and breast cancer progression. Sam68 protein levels were assessed in tissue samples using an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay kit from Sun Long Biotech. Whole RNA was isolated from malignant breast tissue samples obtained from patients. The RNA concentration was determined using an Eppendorf photometer, yielding an average concentration of 62.1\u00b110.07 ng/\u00b5l. The purity of the isolated RNA was evaluated by measuring the A260/A280 ratio (1.9\u00b10.07) and the A260/A230 ratio (1.7\u00b10.3). The results indicated a significant upregulation of Sam68 mRNA expression in breast cancer tissues, supporting the findings from previous studies and indicating the correlation between altered Sam68 expression and the development of breast carcinoma, highlighting the potential significance of Sam68 in the pathogenesis of the disease. Estimating Sam68 in the blood may serve as a potential biomarker for assessing the malignant grade and metastatic spread of breast carcinoma cells.",

However, lower-dimensional representations that retain the useful biological information do exist. We present a novel algorithm for such dimensionality reduction called Pathway Activity Score Learning (PASL). The major novelty of PASL is that the constructed features directly correspond to known molecular pathways (genesets in general) and can be interpreted as pathway activity scores. Hence, unlike PCA and similar methods, PASL's latent space has a fairly straightforward biological interpretation. PASL is shown to outperform in predictive performance the state-of-the-art method (PLIER) on two collections of breast cancer and leukemia gene expression datasets. PASL is also trained on a large corpus of 50000 gene expression samples to construct a universal dictionary of features across different tissues and pathologies. The dictionary validated on 35643 held-out samples for reconstruction error. It is then applied on 165 held-out datasets spanning a diverse range of diseases. The AutoML tool JADBio is employed to show that the predictive information in the PASL-created feature space is retained after the transformation.

The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the research progress of MCCE and artificial intelligence (AI) in the diagnosis and treatment of GID. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed and EMBASE for published studies on GID detection of MCCE, physical factors related to MCCE imaging quality, the application of AI in aiding MCCE, and its additional functions. We synergistically reviewed the included studies, extracted relevant data, and made comparisons. MCCE was confirmed to have the same performance as conventional gastroscopy and WCE in detecting common GID, while it lacks research in detecting early gastric cancer (EGC). The body position and cleanliness of the gastrointestinal tract are the main factors affecting imaging quality. The applications of AI in screening intestinal diseases have been comprehensive, while in the detection of common gastric diseases such as ulcers, it has been developed. MCCE can perform some additional functions, such as observations of drug behavior in the stomach and drug damage to the gastric mucosa. Furthermore, it can be improved to perform a biopsy. This comprehensive review showed that the MCCE technology has made great progress, but studies on GID detection and treatment by MCCE are in the primary stage.

This study aims to explore the characteristics of hospitalizations among chronic dialysis patients in China. Hospital admissions from January 2013 to December 2015 were extracted from a national inpatient database in China. Chronic dialysis, including hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, was identified according to inpatient discharge records and International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) codes. The primary kidney disease, causes of admissions, modalities of dialysis, and comorbidities were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess the association of patient characteristics with multiple hospitalizations per year. Altogether, 266,636 hospitalizations from 124,721 chronic dialysis patients were included in the study. The mean age was 54.46 \u00b1 15.63 years and 78.29% of them were receiving hemodialysis. The leading cause of hospitalizations was dialysis access-related, including dialysis access creation (25.06%) and complications of access (21.09%). The following causes were nonaccess surgery (1.89%), cardiovascular disease (1.66%), and infectious diseases (1.43%). One-fourth of the patients were hospitalized more than once per year.

We retrospectively evaluated 588 healthy adult donors (median age 29 years, range 18-69 years) at our institution from 2017 to 2022. The predicted minimal number of CD34+ cells was calculated as follows: (peripheral CD34+ cells/\u00b5L \u00d7 adjusted collection efficiency of 30%) \u00d7 total liters processed. This formula was further modified according to donor and recipient body weight (BW). Median total collection was 8.0 \u00d7 106 CD34+ cells/kg BW (range 1.0-47.1 \u00d7 106 cells/kg BW) with 522 donors (89%) collecting \u22655.0 \u00d7 106 cells/kg of recipient BW. A second leukapheresis (LP) was performed in 49 donors. Need for two LPs was more common in female donors (OR 6.68, 95% CI, 2.62-17.05; p < 0.001), donors with higher age (OR for 10 years difference 1.53, 95% CI, 1.15-2.03, p = 0.003), donors with WBC count <30 \u00d7 109/L after 5 days of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) stimulation (OR, 4.33; 95% CI, 1.59-11.83; p = 0.004), and a donor/recipient weight ratio <1 (OR 6.21, 95% CI, 2.69-14.34; p < 0.001). Predictive factors for optimal LP (i.e., \u22655.0 \u00d7 106 CD34+ cells/kg of recipient BW) were peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ cell count >50/\u00b5L (OR 12.82, range 6.34-25.92, p < 0.001), male donor (OR 2.77, range 1.06-7.23, p = 0.04), and a donor/recipient weight ratio >1 (OR 3.12, range 1.57-6.24, p = 0.001). WBC, platelets, hemoglobin, and age had no significant predictive value. Predicted versus observed number of CD34+ cells/kg BW collected demonstrated a very strong linear correlation (r = 0.925, 95% CI, 0.912-0.936, p < 0.0001). Of the routinely monitored indicators in PBSC donors, CD34+ cell count in PB is the most important factor in predicting G-CSF-induced PBSC yields. Higher age, female sex, WBC <30 \u00d7 109/L, and a donor/recipient weight ratio <1 are useful indicators for identifying suboptimal mobilizers. The modified formula has shown successful and consistent performance in the prediction of key outcome measures including the minimum CD34+ cell collection, determination of the required length of apheresis, and whether a second day of PBSC collection was necessary to achieve the respective collection goal.",

A prerequisite for AHCT is mobilization and collection of adequate blood graft to support high-dose therapy. Current mobilization strategies include granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone or in combination with chemotherapy most commonly cyclophosphamide (CY). More recently, plerixafor has become into agenda especially in patients who mobilize poorly. In the selection of a mobilization method, several factors should be considered. Preplanned collection target is important as G-CSF plus plerixafor is more effective in the mobilization of CD34+ cells than G-CSF alone. On the other hand, CY plus G-CSF is superior to G-CSF only mobilization. Previous therapy and age of the patients are important considerations as G-CSF alone may not be effective enough in patients with risk factors for poor mobilization. These factors include extensive lenalidomide exposure, irradiation to bone marrow-bearing sites, higher age, or a previous mobilization failure. Also, local preferences and experiences as well as the number of apheresis needed are important issues as well as cost-effectiveness considerations. Mobilization method used may have implication for cellular composition of collected grafts, which might have an impact on posttransplant events such as hematologic and immune recovery in addition to also potential long-term outcomes. Currently, G-CSF alone and preemptive plerixafor if needed might be considered as a standard mobilization strategy in MM patients intended for AHCT.",

Albeit G-CSF alone or combined with chemotherapy is well-established methods for HSC mobilization, up to 40% of the patients fail to mobilize (poor mobilizer, PM). Plerixafor (PLX) is commonly used in PM patients resulting in increased migration of HSCs into peripheral blood and thus improves the collection outcome. The prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-interventional OPTIMOB study assessed mobilization and collection parameter of patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma to get deep insights in the treatment of those patients in clinical routine focusing on PM patients. PM was defined as follows: (1) no achievement of \u226520 CD34+ progenitor cells/\u00b5L before first apheresis, (2) PLX administration at any time point during the observational period, (3) reduction of the initially planned CD34+ progenitor cell yield as necessity due to failed mobilization or HSC collection, and (4) no performance of apheresis due to low CD34+ progenitor level. Primary objective of the study was to assess mobilization success by the proportion of PM patients achieving >2 \u00d7 106 CD34+ progenitor cells/kg body weight on the first day of apheresis. Here, the data of the lymphoma cohort are presented. Out of 238 patients with lymphoma documented in the study, 32% were classified as PM. 87% of them received PLX. Demographic data revealed no obvious differences between PM and good mobilizing (GM) patients. All patients were treated highly individualized prior to mobilization.

We aimed to investigate the 16-year trend of burden of premature mortality in Southern Iran. In this cross-sectional study, all deaths due to various causes of death in Fars Province from the electronic population-based death registration system (EDRS) were obtained. Crude and age-standardized mortality rate, Years of Life Lost (YLL) and YLL rate data were calculated and to examine the trend, joinpoint regression was used. During the study period, 281,903 deaths occurred, of which, 59.85% (n=168,735) occurred in men. Also, 42.18% of these deaths (n=118,610) occurred due to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The total number of YLLs due to premature death was 4,154,828 years. Of these, 2,591,564 years (62.37%) were in men. The highest number of YLL was due to CVDs, external causes of death and cancer. Trend of YLL rate due to premature mortality was decreasing: the annual percent change (APC) was -2.1% (95% CI -2.6 to -1.6, P<0.001) for males, -0.9% (95% CI -1.4 to -0.4, P=0.002) (P=0.002) for females. Although the trend of premature death has been decreasing during the years of study, but the seven major causes of premature death in 2004 to 2019 were non-communicable diseases, especially ischemic heart diseases, stroke, external cause of morbidity, and cancer. Furthermore, our findings indicate a change in the role of non-communicable diseases in premature mortality in recent years.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Factors Affecting Survival of Patients with Cervical Cancer.",
        "AbstractText": "Cervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide. We aimed to identify the factors affecting the survival rate of cervical cancer patients, as these factors are vital for preventing the progression and effective treatment of cancer. In this retrospective cohort study, 254 patients with cervical cancer who were registered in The Kerman Population-Based Cancer Registry (KPBCR) between 2012 and 2022 and whose status was known to be alive or dead were enrolled. Since the proportional hazard assumption was not established for the type of treatment, the extended Cox model was used to determine the variables influencing the survival of the patients. The mean survival time of the patients was 91.28 \u00b1 3.02 months. The results of fitting the extended Cox model showed that the risk of death increases by 1.02 per year of age at diagnosis (HR=1.02; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.04). Moreover, for a one-unit increase in body mass index (BMI), the risk of death increased by 0.93 (HR=0.93; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.98). The risk of death in patients with disease stages III&IV was 3.08 times that of patients with disease stages I&II (HR=3.08; 95% CI: 1.05, 9.03). The risk of death in patients receiving at least one of the radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments after 18 months was 7.11 times that of patients undergoing surgery (HR=7.11; 95% CI: 1.69, 29.91). The age of diagnosis, BMI, disease stage, and type of treatment significantly affect the survival of patients. Thus, raising women's awareness of periodical examinations and early diagnosis can reduce the risk of death and prevent cervical cancer progression.",

        "AbstractText": "We used the multistate model to investigate how prognostic factors of breast cancer are seen to affect the disease process. This cohort study was conducted at Motamed Cancer Institute of Tehran, Iran on 2363 breast cancer patients admitted from 1978 to 2017, and they were followed up until 2018. We applied the multistate models, including four states: diagnosis, recurrence, metastasis, and final absorbing mortality state. Age over 50 years, positive lymph nodes and tumor size intensified the hazard of transition from diagnosis to metastasis (P=0.002, P<0.001 and P=0.001 respectively) and they also intensified the hazard of transition from diagnosis to mortality (P=0.010, P<0.001 and P<0.001 respectively). At the same time, the educational level decreased the hazard of mentioned transitions (P<0.001). Positive estrogen receptors reduced the hazard of transition from diagnosis to metastasis (P=0.007) and positive lymph nodes also intensified the hazard of transition from metastasis to mortality (P=0.040). Tumor size had an increasing role in the transitions from diagnosis to recurrence, recurrence to metastasis, and metastasis to mortality (P=0.014, P=0.018 and P=0.002 respectively). Multistate model presented the detailed effects of prognostic factors on progression of breast cancer. Implementing early diagnosis strategies and providing informational programs, especially in younger ages and lower educational level patients may be helpful in reducing the hazard of transition to higher states of breast cancer and increasing the survival of Iranian women with breast cancer by controlling tumor size growth, lymph nodes involvements and estrogen receptor status.",

In September 2020, we retrieved the expression matrix of glioblastoma (GBM) sufferers and pertinent clinical data from the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database. Prognostic differences between various families with sequence similarity 110 member C (FAM110C) expression groups were assessed by Kaplan-Meier with log-rank test. The R platform get used to assess the accuracy of FAM110C delivery in predicting the prognosis of PDAC using a time-dependent receptor operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The delivery level of FAM110C was determined by qRT-PCR and western blot. Gene set enrichment investigated possible mechanisms between different FAM110C expression groups in GBM (GSEA). The impact of FAM110C on glioma cell movement was discovered using migration test. The drug's gene-targeting impact was validated by the CCK8 test. A total of 173 GBM samples were obtained from the TCGA database, with 148 including information on IDH1 mutations and 151 containing information on overall survival. The mRNA expression level of FAM110C was greater in wild-type GBM, according to qRT-PCR data. The connection between FAM110C expression and Hallmark, GO, and KEGG pathway gene sets was investigated using GSEA software. We used migration test to assess the impact of FAM110C on glioma motility in order to confirm the findings of the GSEA analysis. FAM110C might get used as a possible diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for wild-type GBM, and its inhibition could be used to prevention and treatment wild-type GBM.",

BC is a significant public health in females worldwide, where it remains the leading cause of death among Saudi females. Here, we evaluate the susceptibility of the miRNA genetic variants to the risk of BC in Saudi females. Methods One hundred fifty-four females, including 76 females diagnosed with BC and 78 healthy controls, were analyzed using TaqMan\u2122 (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA) genotyping assays for the miR-196a2 rs11614913 C>T, miR-146a rs2910164 C>G, and miR-499 rs3746444 A>G. We utilized the SNPStats software (https://www.snpstats.net) (Institut Catal\u00e0 d'Oncologia, Barcelona, Spain) to choose the best interactive inheritance model for the examined miRNAs. Results The examined miRNA single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed no clear association with the risk of BC (P > 0.05). As for genotypic distributions, significant associations were found for the rs2910164 SNP in most interactive models of inheritance: 2.50 (95% confidence interval\u00a0{CI}, 1.2-5.17; P = 0.0135) in the codominant model, 2.34 (95% CI, 1.11-4.8; P = 0.0197) in the dominant model, and 2.40 (95% CI, 1.22-4.73; P = 0.0113) in overdominant model. The rs2910164 C/G heterozygosity showed overexpression in cases compared to controls (73.7% versus 53.9%; chi-squared (\u03c72) = 6.5; P = 0.0109), but the homozygous rs2910164 G/G showed a significant protective effect (21.1% versus 38.5%; \u03c72 = 17.4; P\u00a0= 0.019). The heterozygosity did not affect the risk to the BC in the two miRNAs (rs11614913 C>T\u00a0and rs3746444 A>G). Conclusion Despite lacking associations with the examined miRNAs, the heterozygous genotype rs2910164 C/G\u00a0can identify at-risk females. More studies should be replicated using a panel of miRNA genes to discover significant associations with the risk of BC.",

        "AbstractText": "Arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) is the leading cause of nontraumatic lower-extremity amputations. Multiple researches have suggested that circular RNAs (circRNAs) played vital regulatory functions in cancer and cardiovascular disease. Nevertheless, the underlying effect and pathological mechanism of circRNAs in the formation and progression of ASO are still indistinct. This study used microarray analysis to investigate the expression portrait of circRNAs in normal lower extremity arteries and ASO arteries. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted using the KEGG database to study the enrichment of differentially expressed circRNAs (DE circRNAs) and predict their functions. The accuracy of microarray assay was verified by evaluating expression of the top 5 upregulated and 5 downregulated circRNAs (raw density of normal group \u2265200) using RT-qPCR. A circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network was further predicted using software. Compared to the normal lower extremity group, the ASO arteries with HE and EVG staining presented hyperplastic fibrous membrane and luminal stenosis. A total of 12,735 circRNAs were identified, including 1196 DE circRNAs with 276 upregulated and 920 downregulated in ASO group based on |log2(FC)| > 1 and padj < 0.05. Among selected 10 circRNAs, RT-qPCR confirmed that hsa_circ_0003266, hsa_circ_0118936 and hsa_circ_0067161 were upregulated while hsa_circ_0091934 and hsa_circ_0092022 were downregulated in ASO group (p < 0.05). GO analysis presented that the DE circRNAs were primarily enriched in protein binding, intracellular part and organelle organization. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that MAPK signaling pathway, human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection, proteoglycans in cancer were associated with the DE circRNAs. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactive network revealed that both mRNAs and miRNAs linked to circRNAs played an indispensable role in ASO. This study described the expression portrait of circRNAs in human ASO arteries, and revealed the molecular background for further investigations of the circRNA regulatory mechanism in the formation and progression of ASO.",

        "AbstractText": "Glottic tumors with infiltration of the anterior/posterior commissure, and lesions with subglottic, cricoid, or cricoarytenoid joint infiltration have been highly controversial in the past, from the perspective of oncological safety. Although conservation laryngeal resection options exist, most are limited by the extent of resection proscribed by the technique and the postoperative functional results. Oncologically speaking, extended vertical hemilaryngectomy is often the optimal solution. However, limited reconstruction methods often compel total laryngectomy. Eight patients with vocal fold malignancy, which infiltrated the anterior and sometimes the posterior commissure and with subglottic extension and resultant uni/bilateral vocal fold motion impairment, were treated by single stage extended vertical partial laryngectomy with rotational crico-thyrotracheopexy as a functional reconstruction of the laryngeal framework. Patients were evaluated with objective and subjective function tests. Histologic examination demonstrated tumor-free margins in every case. Definitive decannulation was successful in all cases within 2\u2009weeks. All patients had a stable and adequate airway during follow-up and reported socially acceptable voice. Oral feeding was possible in seven patients. Rotational crico-thyrotracheopexy, as a single stage reconstruction technique, is based on well-vascularized, readily available, appropriately shaped local tissues, without significant donor site morbidity or need for long-term stenting to reconstruct large laryngeal defects after extended vertical hemilaryngectomy for advanced unilateral glottic tumors and is applicable even with supra/subglottic invasion or infiltration of the contralateral vocal fold. An adequate airway can be achieved with socially acceptable voice and safe swallowing without compromising oncologic reliability. 4 (retrospective case series review).",

Laryngeal dysfunction in HNC patients is particularly important given the importance of the larynx in voice, swallowing, and airway protection. The objective of our study is to characterize late laryngeal dysfunction in a cohort of long-term HNC survivors. HNC survivors who were at least 2\u2009years post-treatment were recruited prospectively for standard collection of videolaryngoscopy findings, videofluoroscopic swallowing studies, and assessment of clinical outcomes. Descriptive statistics were performed and clinical presentation and outcomes were compared between survivors >10\u2009years and <10\u2009years post-treatment. Additional factor analysis to correlate clinical outcomes with clinical variables was performed. Thirty participants were analyzed with a mean age of 66\u2009years. The majority were male (80%) patients treated for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (67%). Within the cohort, 43% underwent primary chemoradiation therapy and had 13% radiation alone. Common presenting symptoms included swallowing dysfunction (83%), voice change (67%), and chronic cough (17%). Laryngeal findings on video laryngoscopy include vocal fold motion abnormalities (VFMA) in over half of participants (61%) and mucosal changes in 20%. A weak correlation was found between time since treatment and laryngeal dysfunction (r\u2009=\u2009.182, p\u2009=\u2009.34), and no correlation was found between age, sex, time since treatment, or primary site and the presence or absence of VFMA, G-tube status, or tracheostomy-tube status. Late laryngeal dysfunction in HNC survivors contributes to significant morbidity, is difficult to treat, and remains static decades after treatment for their original cancer. The voice-box, or the larynx, plays an important role in voice, swallowing and airway protection. It is particularly vulnerable to radiation-related damage and changes. This study demonstrates the sequelae of long-term damage of the larynx in head and cancer survivors. IV.",

Junior OHNS residents and faculty from residency programs in California, Nevada, and Arizona participated in this workshop in 2020 and 2021. The stations featured airway management techniques, ultrasound-guided needle aspiration, nasoseptal hematoma evacuation, and facial fracture repair using various models and cadavers. Participants completed a pre-workshop survey, post-workshop survey, and 2-month follow-up survey that assessed resident anxiety and confidence in three OHNS emergency situations across knowledge, manual skills, and teamwork using a 5-point Likert scale. Pre-workshop surveys reported the least anxiety and most confidence in teamwork, but the most anxiety and least confidence in technical skills and knowledge related to foreign body retrieval and airway management. Immediately post-workshop participants reported significant reductions in anxiety and increases in confidence, largest in the manual skills domain, in foreign body retrieval (anxiety: -0.99, confidence: +0.95, p\u2009<\u2009.01) and airway management stations (anxiety: -0.68, confidence: +1.07, p\u2009<\u2009.01).

One hundred and one patients with GC (33 women, 68 men; range of age: 29-82 years, median age: 61 years) who had abdominal CT prior to surgical resection were included in the study retrospectively. Two radiologists evaluated CT scans to record the longest dimension of the tumor, the localization of the lesion, the attenuation values of the tumor in the arterial and venous phases (Hounsfield units), invasion depth of the lesion (T stage), and the number of pathological lymph nodes (LNs) (N stage). Postoperative pathological results including resection (R0, R1), T stage, N stage, grade, and histopathological subtype were documented. All CT-provided results and clinicopathological features associated with OS were analyzed by univariate, multivariate, and receiver operator characteristic analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed that none of the CT features were associated with the OS. After resection, the survival ratio was poor for the R1 and high-grade groups than for the R0 and low-grade groups (p=0.001 and p=0.005, respectively). N stage and the longest dimension of the tumor on CT imaging truly estimated R1 resection status (AUC, 0.697; sensitivity, 63%; and specificity, 88%, and AUC, 0.734; sensitivity, 18%; and specificity, 76%, respectively).

It allows minimally invasive assessment of various diseases or anatomic variations affecting the pancreas also with the help of new Doppler technologies, elastography, contrast-enhanced imaging including post hoc image processing with quantification analyses, three-dimensional reconstruction, and artificial intelligence. EUS also allows interventional direct access to the pancreatic parenchyma and the retroperitoneal space, to the pancreatic duct, pancreatic masses, cysts, and vascular structures. This review aimed to summarize new developments of EUS in the field of pancreatology. We highlight the role of EUS in evaluating pancreatic pathology by describing normal anatomic variants like pancreas divisum, pancreatic lipomatosis, pancreatic fibrosis in the elderly and characterizing pancreatic masses, both in the context of chronic pancreatitis and within healthy pancreatic parenchyma. EUS is considered the optimal imaging modality for pancreatic masses of uncertain dignity and allows both cytological diagnosis and histology, which is essential not only for neoplastic conditions but also for tailoring therapy for benign inflammatory conditions. EUS plays an indispensable role in pancreatology and the development of new diagnostic and interventional approaches to the retroperitoneal space and the pancreas exponentially increased over the last years. The development of computer-aided diagnosis and artificial intelligence algorithms hold the potential to overcome the obstacles associated with interobserver variability and will most likely support decision-making in the management of pancreatic disease.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B2 overexpression as a promising therapeutic target and noninvasive screening biomarker for colorectal cancer.",
        "AbstractText": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) has become the second most deadly malignancy in the world, and the exploration of screening markers and precise therapeutic targets is urgent. Our previous research identified leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B2 (LILRB2) protein as a characteristic protein of CRC, but the association between LILRB2 expression and clinicopathological features, the internal mechanism related to CRC progression, and screening diagnostic efficacy are not clear. Therefore, we hypothesized that LILRB2 is significantly highly expressed in CRC tissues, correlated with advanced stage and a poor prognosis, and could be used as a therapeutic target and potential screening biomarker for CRC. To explore whether LILRB2 can be used as a potential therapeutic target and noninvasive screening biomarker for CRC. Patients who underwent radical surgery for CRC at China-Japan Friendship Hospital between February 2021 and October 2022 were included. Cancer and paracancerous tissues were collected to verify LILRB2 expression, and the association between LILRB2 expression and clinicopathological features was analysed. Serum was collected from CRC patients, adenoma patients and healthy controls during the same period to assess the diagnostic value of LILRB2 as a noninvasive screening biomarker, and its diagnostic value was further compared with that of the traditional markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9). A total of 58 CRC patients were included, and LILRB2 protein was significantly overexpressed in cancer tissues compared with paracancerous tissues (P < 0.001). Angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2) protein, as the ligand of LILRB2, was synergistically overexpressed in CRC tissues (P < 0.001), and overexpression of LILRB2 and ANGPTL2 protein was significantly correlated with poor to moderate differentiation, vascular involvement, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, advanced tumor-node-metastasis stage and a poor prognosis (P < 0.05), which suggested that LILRB2 and ANGPTL2 are closely associated with CRC progression. In addition, serum LILRB2 concentrations increased stepwise in healthy individuals, adenoma patients and CRC patients with statistically significant differences. The sensitivity of serum LILRB2 for the diagnosis of CRC was 89.74%, the specificity was 88.89%, the area under the curve was 0.95, and the diagnostic efficacy was better than that of conventional CEA and CA19-9. LILRB2 protein can be used as a potential novel therapeutic target and noninvasive screening biomarker for CRC, which is beneficial for early screening and precise treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a poor prognosis and usually presents resistance against radiotherapy. MEK inhibitors have been proven to possess a radiosensitization effect. The compound KZ-001 as a particular MEK inhibitor is superior to the listed MEK inhibitor AZD6244. To investigate whether KZ-001 could enhance the radiosensitivity of NSCLC cell lines in vitro. MTT and colony formation assay were used to evaluate the radiosensitivity effect of KZ-001. Immunofluorescence, cell cycle, apoptosis staining, and western blot experiments were used to explore the radiosensitivity mechanism. KZ-001 significantly decreased A549 cell viability at 6 Gy and 8 Gy radiation doses and caused the radiosensitivity at 1 Gy, 4 Gy, and 6 Gy in colony formation experiments. The A549 apoptosis ratio induced by irradiation (IR) combined with KZ-001 increased significantly in comparison with that by IR monotherapy (10.57% vs. 6.23%, P = 0.0055). The anti-apoptosis marker Bcl-XL was found downregulated in KZ-001 and IR-treated A549/H460 cells, but apoptosis marker Bax was downregulated in H460. Extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2) phosphorylation of H460 cells could be blocked both by IR alone and IR combined with KZ-001. IR combined with KZ-001 is able to inhibit ERK activation of A549 cells apparently. KZ-001 increased the proportion of G2 phase in irradiated cells from 21.24% to 32.22%. KZ-001 could also significantly increase the double-strand break damage cell ratio to more than 30% compared to the irradiation alone group. MEK1/2 inhibitor KZ-001 is a potential radiosensitizer for clinical applications.",

        "ArticleTitle": "D3-creatine dilution, computed tomography and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for assessing myopenia and physical function in colon cancer: A cross-sectional study.",
        "AbstractText": "Low skeletal muscle mass (myopenia) is common in cancer populations and is associated with functional decline and mortality, but prior oncology studies did not assess total body skeletal muscle mass. Instead, they measured surrogates such as cross-sectional area (CSA) of skeletal muscle at L3 from computed tomography (CT) or appendicular lean mass (ALM) from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). D3-creatine (D3Cr) dilution is a non-invasive method to assess total body skeletal muscle mass, which has been examined in a variety of populations but not in cancer. To compare the associations of D3Cr muscle mass, CT CSA, and DXA ALM with myopenia and physical function, we conducted a cross-sectional study among 119 patients with colon cancer (2018-2022). For each technique (D3Cr, CT and DXA), myopenia was defined as the lowest sex-specific quartile of its measurement. Physical function was measured by the short physical performance battery and grip strength. We calculated Pearson correlations (r) among three techniques, computed Cohen's kappa coefficients (\u03ba) to assess the agreement of myopenia, and estimated Pearson correlations (r) of three techniques with physical function. All analyses were sex-specific. Sixty-one (51.3%) participants were male, the mean (standard deviation) age was 56.6 (12.9) years, and most (68.9%) had high physical function (short physical performance battery: \u226511 points). Correlations and myopenia agreement among three techniques were greater in men than women; for example, regarding D3Cr muscle mass versus CT CSA, r was 0.73 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) for men versus 0.45 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) for women, and \u03ba was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.99) for men versus 0.24 (95% CI: -0.08, 0.52) for women. Among men, higher D3Cr muscle mass was significantly correlated with faster gait speed (r\u00a0=\u00a00.43, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and stronger grip strength (r\u00a0=\u00a00.32, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05); similar correlations were observed for CT CSA and DXA ALM. However, among women, no measure of muscle or lean mass was significantly associated with physical function. This is the first study using D3-creatine dilution method to assess muscle mass in a cancer population. Regardless of the techniques used for muscle or lean mass assessment, we observed stronger correlations, greater myopenia agreement, and more significant associations with physical function in men with colon cancer than women. D3Cr, CT and DXA are not interchangeable methods for assessing myopenia and physical function, especially in women with colon cancer. Future studies should consider relative advantages of these techniques and examine the D3-creatine dilution method in other cancer types.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Curcumin Induces Apoptosis by Suppressing XRCC4 Expression in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.",
        "AbstractText": "Curcumin is a chemical with various pharmacological activities used for cancer treatment. It inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by inducing apoptosis. Here, the mechanism underlying the effect of curcumin on the apoptosis of HCC cells was studied. Cell counting kit-8 and plate cloning assays were used to assess the proliferation of HCC cells, and acridine orange/ethidium bromide and Annexin V/PI staining were used to analyze their apoptosis. HCC xenograft tumor models were established to validate anti-cancer effects of curcumin. Expression levels of XRCC4 protein in tumor tissues were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Correlation between XRCC4 expression and the prognosis of patients with HCC was analyzed by integrating publicly available gene expression data. Curcumin inhibited HCC cells proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with the control group, curcumin significantly promoted the apoptosis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that curcumin downregulated XRCC4 expression levels in HCC tissues. Prognosis of HCC patients with high XRCC4 expression was poorer than that of patients with low XRCC4 expression. Therefore, curcumin exerts anti-cancer effects by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting cell apoptosis in HCC. This may be due to curcumin interference in the repair process of the nonhomologous DNA terminal link of HCC cells by downregulating XRCC4 expression.",

        "AbstractText": "G-coupled protein receptors (GPCR) are the ultimate refuge of pharmacology and medicine as more than 40% of all marketed drugs are directly targeting these receptors. Through cell surface expression, they are the forefront of cellular communication with the outside world. Metabolites amongst the conveyors of this communication are becoming more prominent with the recognition of them as ligands for GPCRs. HCAR1 is a GPCR conveyor of lactate. It is a class A GPCR coupled to G\u03b1i which reduces cellular cAMP along with the downstream G\u03b2\u03b3 signaling. It was first found to inhibit lipolysis, and lately has been implicated in diverse cellular processes, including neural activities, angiogenesis, inflammation, vision, cardiovascular function, stem cell proliferation, and involved in promoting pathogenesis for different conditions, such as cancer. Other than signaling from the plasma membrane, HCAR1 shows nuclear localization with different location-biased activities therein. Although different functions for HCAR1 are being discovered, its cell and molecular mechanisms are yet ill understood. Here we provide a comprehensive review on HCAR1, which covers the literature on the subject, and discussing its importance and relevance in various biological phenomena.",

        "AbstractText": "The lack of molecular targets hampers the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In this study, we determined the cytotoxicity of domperidone, a dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) antagonist in human TNBC BT-549 and CAL-51 cells. Domperidone inhibited cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The annexin V/propidium iodide staining showed that domperidone induced apoptosis. The domperidone-induced apoptosis was accompanied by the generation of mitochondrial superoxide and the down-regulation of cyclins and CDKs. The apoptotic effect of domperidone on TNBC cells was prevented by pre-treatment with Mito-TEMPO, a mitochondria-specific antioxidant. The prevention of apoptosis with Mito-TEMPO even at concentrations as low as 100 nM, implies that the generation of mitochondrial ROS mediated the domperidone-induced apoptosis. Immunoblot analysis showed that domperidone-induced apoptosis occurred through the down-regulation of the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3. Moreover, domperidone downregulated the levels of D2-like dopamine receptors including DRD2, regardless of their mRNA levels. Our results support further development of DRD2 antagonists as potential therapeutic strategy treating TNBC.",

        "AbstractText": "Cell transformation induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) is a critical event in cancer initiation and progression, and understanding the underlying mechanisms is essential for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Licorice extract contains various bioactive compounds, which have been reported to have anticancer and anti-inflammatory effects. This study investigated the cancer preventive efficacy of licochalcone D (LicoD), a chalcone derivative in licorice extract, in EGF and TPA-induced transformed skin keratinocyte cells. LicoD effectively suppressed EGF-induced cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony growth. EGF and TPA promoted the S phase of cell cycle, while LicoD treatment caused G1 phase arrest and down-regulated cyclin D1 and up-regulated p21 expression associated with the G1 phase. LicoD also induced apoptosis and increased apoptosis-related proteins such as cleaved-caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-7, and Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein). We further investigated the effect of LicoD on the AKT signaling pathway involved in various cellular processes and found decreased p-AKT, p-GSK3\u03b2, and p-NF\u03baB expression. Treatment with MK-2206, an AKT pharmacological inhibitor, suppressed EGF-induced cell proliferation and transformed colony growth. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the potential of LicoD as a preventive agent for skin carcinogenesis.",

        "AbstractText": "Treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) has always been challenged by the development of resistance. We investigated the antiproliferative activity of licochalcone H (LCH), a regioisomer of licochalcone C derived from the root of Glycyrrhiza inflata, in oxaliplatin (Ox)-sensitive and -resistant CRC cells. LCH significantly inhibited cell viability and colony growth in both Ox-sensitive and Ox-resistant CRC cells. We found that LCH decreased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and AKT kinase activities and related activating signaling proteins including pEGFR and pAKT. A computational docking model indicated that LCH may interact with EGFR, AKT1, and AKT2 at the ATP-binding sites. LCH induced ROS generation and increased the expression of the ER stress markers. LCH treatment of CRC cells induced depolarization of MMP. Multi-caspase activity was induced by LCH treatment and confirmed by Z-VAD-FMK treatment. LCH increased the number of sub-G1 cells and arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase. Taken together LCH inhibits the growth of Ox-sensitive and Ox-resistant CRC cells by targeting EGFR and AKT, and inducing ROS generation and ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, LCH could be a potential therapeutic agent for improving not only Ox-sensitive but also Ox-resistant CRC treatment.",

We aimed to ascertain the association between SII levels and prostate cancer. We utilized data from the 1999-2010 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between SII and prostate cancer. Additionally, subgroup analyses stratified by age, BMI, history of hypertension and diabetes were performed. A total of 8,020 participants were included in our analysis. After full adjustment, SII was associated with a 7% increased risk of prostate cancer (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99-1.15, p\u2009=\u20090.094). We further categorized SII values into three segments and found that individuals in the highest SII group had a 33% increased risk of prostate cancer than those in the tertile 1 group (OR 1.33; 95% CI 1.01-1.81; p\u2009=\u20090.044; P for trend = 0.046).
