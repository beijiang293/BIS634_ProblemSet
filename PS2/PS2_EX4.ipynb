    "## Dataset: **MIMIC-III** (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is the data about?**\n",
    "    - The MIMIC-III dataset comprises de-identified health data associated with ~40,000 critical care patients. It includes demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests, medications, and more. The chosen data represent hospital admissions records. Each row provides details of an admission event for a patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **row_id**: A unique identifier for the row.\n",
    "- **subject_id**: A unique identifier representing a patient.\n",
    "- **hadm_id**: Hospital admission ID.\n",
    "- **admittime** and **dischtime**: The timestamp of when the patient was admitted to and discharged from the hospital, respectively.\n",
    "- **deathtime**: The timestamp indicating the time of death, if applicable.\n",
    "- **admission_type**: The type of admission, e.g., EMERGENCY.\n",
    "- **admission_location** and **discharge_location**: Location details regarding where the patient was admitted from and discharged to.\n",
    "- **insurance**: The insurance type of the patient.\n",
    "- **language**: Patient's language preference.\n",
    "- **religion**: Patient's religion.\n",
    "- **marital_status**: Marital status of the patient.\n",
    "- **ethnicity**: Ethnic background of the patient.\n",
    "- **edregtime** and **edouttime**: Registration and out time for emergency department, if applicable.\n",
    "- **diagnosis**: Diagnosis given during that particular admission.\n",
    "- **hospital_expire_flag**: A binary flag indicating if the patient died during the hospital stay.\n",
    "- **has_chartevents_data**: Indicates if chart events data is available for the admission.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Where did you find it?**\n",
    "    - The MIMIC-III Clinical Database is available on PhysioNet (doi:[ 10.13026/C2XW26](http://dx.doi.org/10.13026/C2XW26)). PhysioNet provides open access to a wide range of biomedical datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What license was specified?**\n",
    "    - The dataset is publicly available but requires researchers to sign a data use agreement due to the sensitive nature of medical data. It is released under the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why do you think it is interesting?**\n",
    "    - Healthcare analytics is at the forefront of AI research, given its profound impact on society. The MIMIC-III dataset provides a comprehensive view of patient care in critical care units, allowing for exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and potential AI-driven insights that can revolutionize ICU patient care.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Two questions you could explore with this data:**\n",
    "   1. **Patient Demographics and Hospital Outcomes**:\n",
    "   - How do patient outcomes (e.g., mortality as indicated by the `hospital_expire_flag`) vary across different ethnicities or marital statuses? Is there a particular group that has a higher risk?\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. **Admission Types and Length of Hospital Stay**:\n",
    "   - For each type of `admission_type`, what is the average duration of the hospital stay? Is there a noticeable difference in stay duration between emergency and elective admissions?"
